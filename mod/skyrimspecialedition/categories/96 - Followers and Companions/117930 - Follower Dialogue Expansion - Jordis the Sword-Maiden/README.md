This mod is part of my series to renovate vanilla characters with additional depth, unique history or personality, and immersive and detailed interaction.
  
  
  
*"There's the Daedra of Destruction, the Daedra of Nightmares... But the Daedra of Books? Why, gods, why?"*
  
-Jordis on Hermaeus Mora
  
  
  
**How is Jordis envisioned and touched on in this mod:**
  
  
In this mod, Jordis is expanded as a light-hearted, young, and funny Housecarl who serves as comedic relief. Her cheerful personality and quirky sense of humor make her a delightful companion on your adventures.
  
  
Jordis originally came from Dragon Bridge, where her family owned the local inn. Her parents hoped she would find a rich husband in Solitude to elevate them from poverty, so they sent her to the Bards College. However, Jordis had no talent for poetry - partly due to her dyslexia - and her true passion lay in combat.
  
  
After dropping out of the Bards College, Jordis became a guard under Captain Aldis's tutelage. Her time as a guard is filled with amusing stories, including the one that earned her the nickname "Sword-Maiden".
  
  
When the player is named Thane of Haafingar, Jordis volunteers to become your sworn protector. Having never stepped outside Haafingar, she sees this as an opportunity to explore the world and create her own stories (though perhaps not in the literal sense).
  
  
In the mod, Jordis has a **gentle, comedic demeanor,** being a girl who likes to make people laugh with her quirk and innocence.
