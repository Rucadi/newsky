# A Makeover for Taliesin

A Taliesin replacer using the race mod COtR. You DO NOT need to have the COtR race mod installed. The replacer is mostly standalone (he'll use whatever body mesh you have installed). In order to avoid a neck seam, he's using his own body skin texture that is made for the SAM light body. You can of course have a different body installed it might just look a bit strange but why would you have him nude anyway, right? There are currently no plans to make patches for other bodies. If you enjoy my version of this fantastic follower mod, great. If not try him out anyway with a different replacer or just vanilla. I've had him in my load order for just a short time and he's already one of my favorite followers.
