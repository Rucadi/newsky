Gyda is a war widow who lost her husband in the civil war. She is passionate about the art of cooking and of course, that is also her profession: a cook, an excellent one. She used to cook meal for the soldiers stationed in Helgen which earned her the title "The Lovely Lunch Lady", that is until the World eater returned and turned everything to ashes. Gyda was lucky that day, she was on her way to Falkreath to get freshly hunted meat and narrowly escaped the fate similar to Helgen residents. She stays at Dead Man's Drink Inn ever since, and still cooking. 
  
  
Her last-name "Gyatta" is a peculiar one. It's originated from her great grand father, who saved a redguard man from being attacked by a pair of sabrecats. Her great grand father and the redguard man quickly became friends for life. To express his gratitude, the redguard man called his savior "gyata", which means "fierce lion" in his mother tongue. And the old nord warrior wore the name proudly. Eventually through generations, it became "Gyatta". 
  
  
  
  
  
Special feature: 
  
  

  
* She can cook for the player, twice a day via dialogue (12h cool down)
If the player marry her, the cooking dialogue will be removed and she will use vanilla married cooking dialogue instead.
  
This is to avoid function overlap.* Her hair can be toggle between static and SMP hair.
    
  SMP hair requires [HDT-SMP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30872)﻿ or [FSMP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57339)
She come with a pair of unique utensil weapons.
  
I recommend not giving her any other weapons, since it's hilarious to watch her beat the crap out of bandit with these

Some additional info:
  
  

  
* She is originally known as ["Your nord friend's hot mom"](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77835). Her companion counterpart has been tweaked slightly to work with Reverie,
    
  since the orginal required an old version of BnP skin that is no longer available as well as the lack of permission.﻿
She is a Nord. She is essential and is marriageable
  
* She has 100 weight. Why you ask? She ain't a cook if she isn't travelling around with a whole bakery
She is good with light armor, dual wielding one-handed weapons and some archery skill.
  
* She is at Dead-Man's Drink inn - Falkreath.
All screenshots were taken on BHUNP version.
  
* This mod is compatible with both BHUNP and 3BA version of the [Asset Hub](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80819)﻿.
Be very very nice to her, and eat all the meal she cooks for you. 
  

  
  
Outfit Addons:
  
  

  
* By defaults she wear barkeeper clothes with Amulet of Mara if no outfit addon is installed.
She comes with 2 optional outfit addons: Standard and Chrismas Outfit.
