[font=Times New Roman]How it Works...Definitely Read!!:[font=Times New Roman][font=Times New Roman]
  
The following now only applies to Khajiit will Follow:[/font][/font]
  

  
* LotD comes with  2 optional Follower Rooms.

  
* Before you purchase the Follower Room/s, they will be empty.
Once you purchase a Follower Room/s, they will become available for activation using the household planner on the desk in the bedroom. Once activated, they will populate with basic follower furniture.
  
* Once a follower joins you as a follower, their specific room will populate with their specific display furniture and decorations.  At this point you can begin crafting replicas of most followers' items, and placing their items or replicas in their room.
It should not matter if you recruit the follower/s before or after you build your follower room.  It should work fine either way.
  
* Some quest displays and replica crafting recipes will become available once certain quest stages are completed.
If you want to change your room/s from a Follower room to a different type of room, make sure you first remove any displays you've placed or they will end up floating in place in the room.  You can always revert back to a follower room by using the household planner on the desk in the bedroom.
  
* If you use several of these mods, don't worry about any of them overwriting each other, they share the same assets.
Start a new game on installing these.
  

For everyone else

  
* The rest of the followers will populate in the top floor of the Guild House, in the room at the top of the stairs.
Each follower's furniture will appear when they are recruited.
  
* Quest displays will appear as normal when the appropriate stage is done.
Displays that formerly required marrying a certain companion have been modified so that a replica becomes available once you have married \*anyone\*.

\*\* Important Note!
  
This mod only affects the followers items' models and textures, and adds displays to the museum. It does NOT change in any way the followers AI, quests, scripts, etc. That said, **this mod will not add any functionality to these followers' abilities to make the Safehouse their functional home**. Some of these "Super" followers will have their own challenges with player homes in general, and I defer to the mod authors in all matters regarding this.
