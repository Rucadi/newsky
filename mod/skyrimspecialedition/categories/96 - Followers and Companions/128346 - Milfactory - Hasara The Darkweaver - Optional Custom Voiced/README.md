Hasara is a mysterious lady hails from Cyrodiil. She is, or was, a member of a small and elusive group called "The Darkweavers". Her organization take on contract of hunting down and eliminate super natural threats like daedra, demons, vampires, werebeasts and all sort of abominations. Some say they do it because it pay well, some say they do it for connection and political leverage. Some other say they do it simply to strengthen their own by absorbing power of those they have slain, as all members of the Darkweavers possess some dark power. But none of that matters now since a few years ago, the darkweavers organization simply vanished, leaving those few who know about them pondering again.
  
  
With the rumor of dragons returning and vampires running rampant causing all sort of havoc within the province, naturally Skyrim became Hasara's next destination, where else would her talent being put to good use? Talk of some strange ghostly anomaly led her to Ivarstead, she is now staying at Vilemyr Inn.
  
  
Hasara has some vampiric trait like really pale skin and long fangs, but she is not a vampire, more like result of a ritual she had taken a long time ago, when she was just a young girl joining the Darkweavers. During combat, she omits a dark smoky aura that strengthen her close-combat capability.
