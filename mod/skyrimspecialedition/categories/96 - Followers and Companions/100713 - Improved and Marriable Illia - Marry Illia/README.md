# Improved and Marriable Illia - Marry Illia

Makes it possible to marry the mage follower Illia, and also fixes her general follower settings. She is no longer a simple reskin of a levelled frost mage only designed as a temporary follower. She is now a proper follower and marriage candidate. 
  
  
In the vanilla game, Illia uses a boss frost mage as a template and is only a dungeon follower, basically designed to join you for the dungeon only, and then kept around afterwards as a very buggy half-follower. Much of this is already fixed in the Unofficial Patch, but this mod takes her character further, turning her into a slightly stronger follower and a marriage candidate.

Simply talk to her while wearing the Amulet of Mara, after speaking to Maramal in Riften about marriage, just like any vanilla marriage candidate. 
  
  
By default her residence is Darklight Tower, the dungeon you first meet her in. This can be changed in various ways, however. Including the default spousal home system. 
  
  
Fully compatible with [Vanilla Follower Expansion Illia](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92333)﻿ and [Follower Dialogue Expansion - Illia](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/137845), two mods that add dialogue to Illia, and also fully compatible with [Illia Expansion Synergy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/137964) which allows both to work together. These mods also feature dialogue which gives her a personal reason for preferring frost magic, and this mod does not conflict with that as she does not deviate from being primarily a frost mage like in vanilla. 
  
  
This can be easily made compatible with any appearance changing mod you use by simply combining the changes you want together in a plugin using [SSEEdit](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/164). If the appearance changer doesn't have a plugin it will be compatible straight away.
