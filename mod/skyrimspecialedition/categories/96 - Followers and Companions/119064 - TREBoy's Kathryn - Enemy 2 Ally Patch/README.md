# TREBoy's Kathryn - Enemy 2 Ally Patch
- Author: TREBoy and nazarethblood
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/119064


The original follower mod is still required. You can find it [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/75329). Install the original follower and then my patch. The enemy version will have a tome on them that allows you to summon the follower version. You can then proceed as normal and invite them to join you.
  
  
**What is this enemy to ally thing?**
  
  
All E2A followers come equipped with a very special feature. They no longer sit around waiting for you while clogging up valuable inn space. Instead, each follower is placed out in the world for you to discover and defeat. Only then will you be considered worthy of their time and have the ability to recruit them as a companion. 
  
  
**But where are they?**
  
  
That's for me to know and you to find out by traversing Skyrim and playing as you normally would. You're bound to run across them as they are not hidden. 
  
  
Note: If you really must cheat you can look at the included text document in the zip file for their possible locations. Yes. You read that right. Each follower has three possible locations where they might spawn.

**Issues**
  
  
If you have a neck seam please check first if you have a mod like Wet Function Redux active. This may be the culprit. 
  
  
It is a known issue that the teleport spells don't work the first time. Just use it a second time and she should pop right up!
