This mod is part of my series to renovate vanilla characters with additional depth, unique history or personality, and immersive and detailed interaction.
  
  
  
*"Whatever you may think of the Guild, it's a place where wretched and deplorable souls like us can thrive. I have no intention of going back to the streets and struggling on my own."*
  
  
  
**How is Sapphire envisioned and touched on in this mod:**
  
  
In this mod, Sapphire is made into a **fully fledged follower** and expanded as a seasoned thief who looks out for her own interests. She holds no true loyalty, **all she cares about is survival** - and that means getting the job done and getting paid. However, beneath her tough attitude, **she hides a shadow that haunts her dreams.**
  
  
She joins the player after the player **completes the Goldenglow Estate quest "Loud and Clear."** She recognizes your potential and believes you are her best chance to find out what's wrong with the Thieves Guild, and potentially set things right - not for loyalty, but because **she is frightened that she'll have to survive on her own again.**
  
  
Sapphire has a **tough, no-nonsense demeanor.** She has a harsh outlook on life and those that surround her.
  
  
Will you redeem the Guild with a senior thief, and perhaps find something more?

**Features:**
  
1. Make Sapphire a fully fledged follower and expands Sapphire with 208 lines, all voiced by high quality AI (see the video for reference)
  
2. Enhance the Thieves Guild questline narrative
  
3. Quest awareness for Thieves Guild, Companions, Dark Brotherhood, vanilla main quest and DLC main quest
  
4. New story-driven interactions
  
5. Marriage and new romantic lines if married
  
6. Awareness to her surroundings, such as location and weather
  
7. Reaction to Illia
  
8. Completely lore-friendly, expanding rather than completely rewriting the character
  
9. Immerse into your game world as a character who lives in it, rather than taking over the show
  
  
This mod is **100% compatible with any mod** which gave her a new voice and new story.
  
  
**Safe to add and update mid-save.**
  
  
There is a potential for **future expansion** with Sapphire including **optional** synergy with the overarching Shezarrine Saga
