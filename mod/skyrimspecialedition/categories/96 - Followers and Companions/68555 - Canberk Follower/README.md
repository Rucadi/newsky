Is it a good follower?
  
No. Therefore realistic
  
  
Is it useful?
  
No. Therefore realistic
  
  
Is it looking exactly like me?
  
Not really.
  
  
Why do we want this then?
  
For people that want to slap my face or people that use my collections and want to meet with the curator in a virtual environment and kill it for the bugs they encounter along the way.
  
  
But hey, maybe the bugs we encounter along the way were the real treasures. Who knows?
  
  
You can find Canberk in the Sleeping Giant Inn, in riverwood.
  
He is a Breton.
  
He'll be eating probably, look at the tables or look around in general.
  
  
He has 100 one handed... because you know why.
  
100 illusion, to hide the bugs you'll encounter along the way.
  
  
And some speech and sneak skills etc. that will serve no use at all.
