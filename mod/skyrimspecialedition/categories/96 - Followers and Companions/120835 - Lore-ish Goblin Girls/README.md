I love Reaper864's Goblins, but having three cute goblins hanging out in Dead Man's Drink broke immersion for me (and yes I know having hot goblins alone probably does for many also, but I'm getting to that...).  Also, for some reason Roxie's armor flashes on and off for me (I use SkyrimVR).  So I decided to move them to a better location and give them different clothing.
  
  
However, I like light/lean mods that don't have a lot of other requirements, so I only used vanilla assets to do this.  This means I gave Roxie and Selkie forsworn armor (I left Vibian in her clothing), and moved them to Crystaldrift Cave.  I also took out the encounters in that cave so it would not cause problems with meeting the goblins (was only four animal encounters anyway).  This location has additional benefits.  First, it is very near Gromm's Pass which is where the Goblins are in the Anniversary Edition, making it more lore friendly for those using AE.  It's also right next to a Goblin encampment if you're running CC Goblins expanded, making it make even more sense.  Finally, Crystaldrift Cave is home to the resting place of Gadnor, a Wood Elf who has Gadnor's Staff of Charming, along with an added AE backstory tied to Sheoggorath and the Saints and Seducer's quest.  Now, it makes a little more sense why three hot goblins would be friendly to the player hanging out near their goblin buddies... because they've been charmed by a master illusionist tied to the Daedric Prince of Madness, and now guard his body waiting for another master to take up his staff.  Ah, that dirty little Gadnor...
  
  
Final note, I want to thank Reaper864 for the fantastic mod as well as permission to tweak it.  This tweak does require all three of his goblins.  Send me a message if there are problems or suggestions and I will do my best to address them, but right now I don't plan on doing this mod for each individual goblin.  It's all or nothing lol.
