You may google "**Anbeegod (Shezarrine team)**" and check the "About" page for my **Discord community's link**.
  
I have a Discord community where you can keep updated on future release, but I cannot post the link here due to Nexus policy of advertised content.

This mod is part of my series to renovate vanilla characters with additional depth, unique history or personality, and immersive and detailed interaction.
  
  
  
*"Honor is more than a word, more than a lofty standard set by the collective sentiment of the fearful... Honor is found in deeds alone."*
  
  
  
**How is Aela envisioned and touched on in this mod:**
  
  
In this mod, Aela is expanded as a **stoic and ferocious huntress, who despite her wild heart still holds out to the pursuit of honor.**
  
  
Aela comes from a long line of Huntsmen and Shield Sisters. She grew up in the wilds, hunting beasts both great and small alongside her father. She dreamed of fighting beside her mother in Jorrvaskr, but her mother's untimely death drove Aela to seek the beast blood of Hircine to avenge her.
  
  
Since then, Aela has embraced the power of the wolf, using it to become a stronger huntress. With this power, she can tear apart the vermin that plague Skyrim - bandits, Falmer, and vampires alike. **The Daedric blood of Hircine has become a core part of her identity,** and she will not let anyone take it from her. She **does not expect you to agree with her, but she will not suffer any disrespect.**
  
  
The player can recruit Aela after completing the Companions questline, but her new dialogues would still be present even if you recruit her prematurely through other means.
  
  
In the mod, Aela has a **stoic, pragmatic, yet honorable demeanor,** who believes **the ends justify the means** and honor lies in the lives saved and the villains purged, not in how you do it.

You are free to make one, as long as it requires the original mod (this mod).

8. Can I recruit her before completing the Companion questline?
  
By default, no. But this mod still works if you use another mod to recruit her. It will assume you have already completed the Companions questline.
