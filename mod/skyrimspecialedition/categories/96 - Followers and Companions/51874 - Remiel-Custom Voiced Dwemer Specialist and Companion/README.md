***IMPORTANT*If you are updating from a previous version to 1.6.0+, you MUST start a new game. *You MUST start a new game, or the big quest will be broken, which will make us both sad.***If you are installing Remi for the **first time** at 1.6.0+, then it is fine on an ongoing save. If you've had her in any previous version on your current save, *you MUST start a new game.* This means selecting **New Game** from the main menu. Using a *'clean save'* is not sufficient (and will probably wreck your save anyway).
  
  
**Overview:**
  
  
Remiel is a Breton Dwemer specialist. She hails from Wayrest, and having explored her fill of the dwemer ruins in High Rock, she has moved on to explore Skyrim. The only problem is, she's not much of a fighter, and will need your help to see all that Skyrim has in store for her.
  
  
She is custom-voiced with approximately 5,000 lines of dialogue. She is aware of the cities and towns of Skyrim, of various weathers, and of the times of day. She works off a custom follower framework, which means that similarly to Inigo, for example, using NFF, AFT, etc. **will break** her. If you do use these to manage her, or if you have AFT in your LO *at all*, I will unfortunately not be able to help with bug fixes.
  
  
You can find Remi staying at Markarth's Silverblood Inn, where she is staying after having been turned away from Nchuand-Zel, the ruins under the city. You can offer your aid in gaining entrance to the ancient dwemer city, embarking on a mini-quest that follows along with the vanilla quest "The Lost Expedition." During this quest, Remi will obtain her dwemer spider and become a "full" follower, unlocking various discussion topics, quest dialogue, idle commentary, and a regard system.
  
  
Remiel's spider, Scrap, can be upgraded. After completing her initial quest, you will be prompted to take Remi exploring with you, and after seeing a number of dwemer ruins in your travels, she will begin making improvements. A detailed explanation can be found below.
  
  
**Skills:**Spoiler
  
While Remi will rely on you and Scrap to see her through dungeons safely, she has other skills that may prove useful to you.
  
  

  
* Thievery comes naturally to her, and if you hand her some lockpicks, she's sure to make quick work of any doors in your way. Being physically weak, she's also learned to try and get by her foes unnoticed, giving her experience in stealth and avoiding traps.
A tendency to experiment lends itself toward potion-brewing. She may not have formal training in alchemy, but she's brave enough to eat strange ingredients and throw them into potions, just to see what may be created. Her potions may be useful... or they may not. That's for you to discover.
  
* While Remi's areas of knowledge tend toward the mechanical, she is a Breton, after all, and so has an innate ability with magic. Although she never quite got the hang of the more advanced magics, she can keep her health up. If you become a close enough friend, maybe she'll even use her restoration spells for you.
  
  
**Common Questions:**I have compiled an FAQ and Quest Guide, which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JUNNalaj6alRwRiY9shqu8AE-NBmNLIR/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=111809899908610796575&rtpof=true&sd=true). Please take a glance if you have a question or concern and see if this doc can help. :)**More In-depth on her Features:**
  
  
Spoiler*Regard:* Remi currently has a very simplistic regard system. She will begin neutral, and depending on your responses to various discussions you have with her, she may like you more or less as time goes on. I won't go into details, but in essence, if you are mean to her, she won't like you very much! Bretons also have a complicated history with the Altmer and the Nords, and this will show in some of her views. This doesn't mean that she'll hate you for being a Nord or an Altmer, but she will start out with some misgivings about those cultures. She is wary of the Stormcloaks, but if you have a discussion with her about why you've chosen to fight for Ulfric (and aren't mean about it), she will come to an understanding with you.
  
  
*Potions:* If you ask Remi about herself, you may learn that she brews potions on occasion. After talking with her about this, you will be able to ask her for some sample potions in safe places (i.e., Inns, Player Homes). She is self-taught, so her potions tend to be a little wonky. These potions have the base vanilla effect in addition to a strong secondary effect but also a costly third effect. Give them a try. :) After all, she's worked hard on them.
  
  
*Upgrading Scrap:* Each dwemer ruin Remi sees will give her some inspiration in how she programs her dwemer spider. How strong Scrap is depends on how many of these ruins she has seen. By default, Scrap starts at "Level 1". 
  
  
1-Basic Dwemer Spider, levels at a rate of 0.8 with the PC
  
2-Increased Attack Strength, levels at a rate of 0.8 with the PC
  
3-Adds the Dwemer Spider lightning attack, levels at a rate of 0.9 with the PC
  
4-Increased Attack Strength, levels at a rate of 0.9 with the PC
  
5-Adds the Dwemer steam attack, levels at a rate of 1.0 with PC
  
  
The locations that will count toward this quest include:
  

  
* Mzulft
Alftand
  
* Ikrngthand
Kagrenzel
  
* Avanchnzel
Bthardamz
  
* The Aetherium Forge
Mzinchaleft
  
* Raldbthar
Arkngthamz
  

  
*Healing:* After you reach a high level of friendship with Remi, she will offer to heal you in battle. If you reach less than 40% health, she will attempt to patch you up.
  
  
*Set Home:* Can tell Remi to live in any Inn or Player Home, and she will return there to sandbox after being dismissed.
  
  
*Relax:* If you're getting your busywork done, melting down all that dwarven metal for ingots, and you're tired of Remi drilling holes into the back of your head as you work, you can tell her to relax. She will remain within the general vicinity you asked her to relax in and get her own busywork done. She'll only relax in places that are safe to relax in (inns, player homes, towns, and cities). If you're feeling kind, you can bring her a drink while you guys unwind.
  
  
*Projects:* If you are good enough friends with her, Remi might talk about projects that she is working on and ask for your help. While relaxing, see if she seems to be thinking about anything to trigger each project. Currently, there are three projects, but more will be added down the line.
  
  
*Horse Riding:* You can ask Remi to ride her horse. Keep in mind that she can't follow you into cities while riding, so have her dismount if you're heading into town.
  
  
*Lockpicking:* Remiel can pick locks, using a spell that is given to the PC after completing or skipping her intro quest. Use this spell instead of the vanilla commands in order to have her lockpick.
  
  
*Marriage:* Complete the "Upgrades" quest and/or hear Remi talk about her history with her father and with her previous relationship. This will allow the player to start "flirting" with her, with a dialogue option aptly named 'flirt.' Each option in this category will award a set number of points toward setting her as a marriage candidate, with 12 points being the minimum for marrying her. You'll know you've reached this because Remi will have force-greeted you four times to 'flirt' back. At this point, the marriage proceeds according to vanilla. After marriage, Remi will have some unique idles, will make you meals, will run a "store," and can be given gifts. She'll also banter with your kids.
  
  
*Disable Automaton*: After Remi's Crossbow is made, she will think up a new project that will help her learn how to disable automaton so long as she and the PC are undetected. This will be done through a spell given to the player.
  
  
*Toggle the Use of Her Automaton*: Remi can be told to stop using her dwemer spider in battle, through a dialogue option under "I have a favour to ask." This can also be turned back on at any point.
  
  
*Lantern:* Remi will use a lantern inside or outside when it is dark, after completing the necessary project. This can be toggled off.
  
  
*Follow Distance:* If you find that Remi's short little legs cannot keep up with you, or that she becomes distracted and falls behind, you can change her follow distance to be closer. There are three options: very close, medium, and vanilla.
  
  
*Names:* Remi has a select number of names she can call the player. Please note I am NOT taking name requests. A list of the names can be found below.

**Compatability:**
  
  
**Incompatible:**
  
  
*Amazing Follower Tweaks:* 
  
This will adopt her into the framework and will cause issues. I will not help with any issues related to having her in AFT.
  
  
**Soft Incompatibility:***Other Follower Frameworks (I.e.- NFF):*So long as she is not imported into the framework, they should work fine. If she is imported, it will cause issues.
  
  
*Mods that affect Banter Rate:*Might cause issues with when she says certain commentary that progresses some of her quests.
  
  
*Mods that affect the Vanilla Marriage:*If you plan on marrying her, do not run marriage mods, or it will confuse her.
  
  
  
**Plans:**
  
  
Spoiler

**Disclaimer:**
  
  
This is my first mod, and it's a learning process. I keep discovering more and more things that I can do, and looking back and realizing that some of my work could be more efficient. Hindsight is 20/20, after all. So if you find any strangeness, bugs, or the like, please tell me, so I can go back and fix my errors!
