Cities should be more lively with more unique NPCs doing their daily routines. With Lively Skyrim series, we'll be adding unique NPCs and followers mostly on big cities. 
  
  
  
  
With Lively Skyrim series, our goal is to add lacking NPC types and followers to places where it would make most sense. For example, Whiterun is supposed to be the trade hub yet there are not enough merchants in the city / outskirts. With this series, we'll solve this kind of overlooked problems :) When i finish the project, i will publish bundled mods called Lively Skyrim: Whiterun, Lively Skyrim: Markath etc. etc.
  
  
  
For this mod, we make Whiterun more lively itself by adding children that roams especially around the market stalls, knocking some things over here and there. There are already some children in Whiterun but if you imagine any movie that takes place in an area with market stalls, you almost always imagine some children playing around and knocking things over between the stalls.
  
  
With this mod we add 2 Nord twins, Jake and Nate to Whiterun who will run around the market stalls, knock things over and interact with people around them.
  
  
These children are unique and are actually also followers. Why? The adoption mechanics in Skyrim feels a lot to be desired. For example, you sadly can not take your children to trips or fun activities. They sadly always have to stay indoors. With making them followers, we aim to change this and make you able to spend time with a mentee, rather than just a children. They will follow you around, they will see the world, meet new people, visit new cities. Isn't this how adventurers should be raised? 
  
  
\*\*Disclaimer\*\*
  
This mod does not make the children fight or do any unsuitable acts. The only thing it can do is to make the child follow you around and nothing else. I do not encourage you to take a child follower to any fight scenes anyway. Mod author or nexus mods does not encourage violance against children in any way and are not responsible of any accusations that may be related to this nature.
  
  
History about these 2 children:
  
  
They are actually the twins of one of our community members who always knock things over and run around in the house, in real world as well :) I am not sharing any irl pictures for privacy reasons.
  
The vanilla assets are very limited for children in Skyrim, so the children generally look very similar to each other. This is a limitation we want to change in future.
