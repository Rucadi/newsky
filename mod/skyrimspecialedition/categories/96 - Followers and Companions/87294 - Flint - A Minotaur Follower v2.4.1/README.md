*![](https://i.imgur.com/YBhe8kc.png)* ﻿Flint is a custom-voiced follower who is – as you can probably tell – a minotaur. He hails from the mountains of Cyrodiil, having learned the languages of man and travelled to the land of Skyrim in search of separation from his past. On the surface, he's nothing more than a big brute who doesn't like anybody and enjoys little more than senseless violence. As you get to know him, however, you'll start to learn that he's more than what others see, and his rage-filled personality is fueled by a deeply troubled past. He wants to be better, and knows he is harmful to others, but he can't redeem himself by his efforts alone.
  
  
 ﻿You may choose to bond with him and navigate his complex emotions, which will prove to be a challenging experience. If you succeed, you can make a life-long companion out of seemingly impossible odds... but if you fail, you will lose him forever. Ultimately it's up to you how much of his character you want to delve into; at the end of the day, you'll get out of him what you put into him. You will have to spend time with him, talk to him, and dedicate many hours of gameplay towards building your trust with him. If you just want a huge, strong barbarian who can destroy everything in his wake, Flint can be that. At the same time, if you choose, he can be much, much more.
  
 ﻿
  
 **﻿To find Flint, go to Dead Man's Drink and read the note on the counter titled "Notice to All Citizens". That should tell you where he is, and it will start his intro quest.**
  
 ﻿Since his last iteration, Flint has been updated with a lot more content for you to explore. Below is a list including (but not limited to) his many features. 
  
  

  
* 5000+ unique lines of dialogue, discussing a wide variety of situations, locations and topics in Skyrim
Multiple questions about himself, his past, his preferences, or just his current thoughts
  
* A relationship system that will slowly increase over time and affect how he greets you, responds to you, and remarks on your chatter with him
A detailed friendship and romance quest that takes you and Flint on a journey of betterment, helping him heal through his trauma and past
  
* The ability to tan hides for you, use potions in combat, and carry more gear than the average follower
Greeting lines for every single stage of the main quest, beginning to end
  
* Comments on every single named cell in the game not within a city
Idles that remark on items in his inventory, as well as the people he’s around and the stats of the player
  
* And more!

[left]﻿ ﻿Spoiler**YOU MUST INSTALL FLINT ON A NEW SAVE FILE. WHETHER YOU ARE UPDATING FROM A PREVIOUS VERSION OR IF YOU ARE INSTALLING HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME, YOU NEED TO MAKE A NEW SAVE GAME. Flint has a lot of packages, scenes, and scripts that because of Skyrim's nature, NEED to be loaded on a new save game to function properly.**
  
 ﻿It’s worth noting since 2.1.0 that *Flint is entirely standalone.* He requires no other mods to function, and will work both with and without his previous source mod (Ungulate Races). However, below are a handful of mods that while not required, may help if you are experiencing issues and were present when he was being made.
  
**XPMSSE**
  
**﻿Face Discoloration Fix**
  
**﻿USSEP**
  
**﻿Expressive Facegen Morphs**
  
 **﻿****Flint may require XPMSSE depending on how you are playing with him**. Notably, Flint tends to get a bit weird if you try to take off his default outfit - if you attempt to forcefully unequip his pants, the game will crash. Now, for most players I imagine this won't be a big issue, since they may never want to see him naked. If you don't intend to take Flint's pants off, you can safely disregard this message and install him without XPMSSE. However, for players wanting to unveil what lies beneath, *you will need XPMSSE.* This remedies a bug with Ungulate Races related to his skeleton and if you have it, you can take off his pants without worry of crashing your game. By default he wears a loincloth, but you can also download the TNG patch or use any other mod to alter that area as you wish. The TNG Patch requires The New Gentleman, obviously.
  
﻿ ﻿**Installation-wise,** as with any other mod, just throw him in your mod manager of choice and he should be good to go. Put him high up in your load order if possible - I recommend using LOOT or something similar to properly sort him. **If you’re updating from the last version of Flint, be sure to completely remove the previous version and load a new game once you've installed the new version.** 
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/TySc3aQ.png)﻿﻿[/left][left] SpoilerFlint has custom scripts, so mods that attempt to alter these scripts (such as AFT or NFF) will potentially screw with his brain; **Do not import him into them if you want to avoid problems.** The intro quest will also not spawn him or necessary NPC’s properly if you have a mod that significantly overhauls the Falkreath worldspace (such as Redbag’s), so keep that in mind. Patches do exist for COTN Falkreath and Redbag's Falkreath, made by WhiskersIsCat, linked below. By default his body mesh associated with his outfit is the SoS body (since that's the body that Ungulate Races uses) but if you give him any other outfit it will reset back to the vanilla body mesh, or the HIMBO mesh if you use that. **His base outfit is NOT HIMBO COMPATIBLE BY DEFAULT, but a patch has been made by TotoThorn that you can find right [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/137888)﻿.** Other than that he should function as usual and work alongside the majority of modlists. If you encounter an issue with him and another mod, please put it in the bugs tab and we’ll see if we can’t get it resolved.[/left]![](https://i.imgur.com/DNGoKQi.png)
  
[left]Spoiler*Flint won't talk to me in the jail!***Make sure you read the note in Dead Man's Drink before going to talk to him** - otherwise his intro quest won't start. You can also find the same note in the barracks, on the table with the steel war axe nearby, and on the table in the jail cell next to the book.
  
  
*Is he patched with or does he interact with any other mods?*Currently no, not content-wise. He is designed with the vanilla game in mind, and currently has no interactions with other custom followers, though those are in the works. If there are any conflicts with him and a mod, or if you wish for a certain patch to be made, feel free to contact me for permission to make a patch - however those will be user-end and not my own focus. Once I start to add follower interactions and vanilla/modded quest patches, I will include them in a list here.
  
  
*Flint won't equip the gear I give him!*This is unfortunately a bug with the vanilla system that doesn't allow him to remove his default outfit for some reason, and prioritizes it over any gear regardless of stats or skill preference. I'm working on a fix for this, but for now, using a mod like [You Wear What I Tell You to Wear](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6623) will make it feasible to give him other equipment. When this bug gets fixed I will put out a patch for it.﻿
  
 
  
*Is he romanceable?*
  
**Yes!**Check the section below for an outline of his romance/friendship quest. It's pretty large, so it should give you lots of content and storytelling to work with.
  
  
*I'm having an issue with the romance or friendship quest, how do I fix it?*There is a written guide further down on this modpage, under the Romance/Friendship category, that can likely answer a lot of your questions. The quest has been tested extensively and designed to be relatively stable, so most of the known bugs are documented and/or fixable. However, if that doesn't answer your question, feel free to join my Discord server and ask about it.
  
  
*Is Flint ported to console?*
  
**Yes!**Flint has been ported to Xbox and you can find him [right here](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/details/71153/Flint_the_Minotaur___A_Skyrim_Follower_Mod), as well as at the bottom of the page.﻿
  
  
*Will he work with version X of Skyrim?*
  
He's most likely to work on 1.6.1170 since that's what I have him saved and do dev work on, but if you're having issues with a different version, you can use BEES if you need to update your game, [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441). 
  
  
*Flint won't let me trade with him/Flint won't wait/I can't dismiss Flint!*If it's the first two, try dismissing and then re-recruiting him. If you can't dismiss him, try kill/resurrect or disable/enable via console commands. If all else fails, reinstall the mod. If *that* fails, then you might have an SEQ bug or something and you may need to either put in a bug report or join my discord server to troubleshoot.
  
  
*Flint isn't at the jail/Flint's note isn't showing up!*
  
Either quickload, reinstall the mod, or use the console to find him and spawn him or his note near you. Double-check to see if his esp is actually enabled - if it isn't then he just won't spawn at all and you may have a larger issue. Remember if you have mods that overhaul Falkreath (and by association, rearrange the worldspace significantly), he may not be in the jail properly. **If you use Redbag's Falkreath or COTN Falkreath, you can find a patch for both right [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/156884), made by WhiskersIsCat.﻿**
  
  
*Is this mod still in-progress?*
  
Yes. More details in a later section but this is V2.4.0 of Flint, and I plan to release several more versions after this. This mod is not "done" and I can't say if it ever will be, but you can look at the roadmap if you want a general outline for what future versions will hold.
  
  
*What if my question isn’t on here?*
  
Message me in my discord server or put up a comment and I’ll see if I can’t answer it. If you have a suggestion for me you'd like to leave in the comments, please do so kindly. I am new to modding and still learning the ropes, so there will be some odd edits or varied lines of code here and there that I missed. Thanks for being patient. [/left]*![](https://i.imgur.com/5pe0Cjb.png)*Spoiler3/19/2023: Initial release of V1.0
  
7/16/2023: Initial release of V2.0
  
8/28/2023: Update 2.01
  
 ﻿*v2.01 fixed the bugs that were occurring with his follower functions; namely, he wouldn't trade, wait, or be dismissed. Those bugs should be remedied now. ﻿As well, some of his dialogue conditions were updated - his question system is now based on his relationship rank, so you can't ask him everything right ﻿away. This should help to spread out his conversations a bit more, and also makes a bit more sense with you getting to know him over time. I also rearranged his files so they're in a nice, neat bsa folder as opposed to being loose. Lastly, he is now wearing the Ragged Trousers to start off with, instead of Hide Armor.*
  
10/15/2023: Release of LE edition
  
 *﻿Flint released as a Skyrim LE mod. Nothing else is changed from before, he's still version 2.01.*
  
1/29/2024: Initial release of V2.1.0
  
 ﻿*v2.1.0 added a great deal of new content, all of which can be viewed in Flint's trailer; but to summarize, he can now relax at inns when asked and be assigned a home that he will return to when dismissed (at a certain relationship rank). He also has comments on every single interior cell in the game that isn't within a city, as well as another question tree that unlocks at relationship rank 600. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, he is now fully standalone from Ungulate Races, meaning you don't have to download any other mods to use him.*2/3/2024: LE Release of v2.1.0
  
3/10/2024: Release of v2.1.1
  
 ﻿*Update 2.1.1 just added some brutal battle scars to Flint's textures, the assets of which were used from DomainWolf's **Skin Feature Overlays**. Nothing else changed from 2.1.0.*4/3/2023: Release of v2.1.2
  
 ﻿*Update 2.1.2 fixed a small issue where Flint's teeth and mouth were using the textures of his horns, rather than the proper mouth textures. This resulted in some teeth being discolored or looking quite unnatural (as seen in the screenshots), so 2.1.2 just re-pathed the files in nifskope and now he has the proper appearance for his mouth. A small update, but notable nonetheless.*4/6/2024: Console port
  
 *﻿Flint v2.1.2 has been successfully ported to Xbox, and henceforth will be updated there as normal.*
  
8/10/2024: Initial release of V2.2.0
  
 ﻿*v2.2.0 added a romance quest, which is detailed below. Besides that he was also given many small adjustments - his outfit changed slightly to include Arm Bandages, his relationship system was reworked a bit to work more consistently, his intro quest was adjusted and added onto, a lesser power was added to check his relationship status, and various other small bugfixes were patched.* 12/23/2024: Initial release of V2.3.0
  
 ﻿*v2.3.0 added a **lot** of new content to explore, both minor and major. Most notably, his romance quest was expanded upon to add more routes and endings - again, the details of which can be found below. Beyond that, Flint got some small updates to his gameplay like being able to rest at player homes, having a tracker in case he gets lost, and variance in dialogue for completion of the romance quest. He also got a lot of visual updates such as a new custom warhammer, a new custom outfit, some added scars and a pair of earrings, and unique jewelry for the potential marriage quest. Lastly I also resolved some bugs and streamlined some of his scripts so things should break less often. All in all, both small and big changes that add content and improve the quality of life of his overall gameplay and presence.*
  
1/19/2025: Patch update 2.3.1
  
 ﻿*2.3.1 was a minor content/bugfix patch that sought to resolve some of the continuing issues players have had with Flint, as well as add some little storytelling bits to the romance quest for narrative and clarity's sake. Most of these changes are passive adjustments that you shouldn't have to worry about, and those that are more noticeable should positively contribute to gameplay.*
  
8/8/2025: Initial release of V2.4.0
  
 ﻿*2.4, or what I like to call the "Relationship Overhaul Update", heralded the release of Flint's friendship quest (which is described in more detail below), and also just a lot of quality of life updates that round him out as a follower. He has a summoning system that can bring him to you if he's lost or stuck, and will offer to tan hides for you. He has awareness on if the player is a vampire or werewolf, and speaks to you differently if you end up imprisoned in jail with him. You can toggle which pronouns you'd prefer to use with him, how close or far you want him to follow you, and whether he uses potions in combat or not. He also got some small visual updates to his outfit/appearance, and his scripts were adjusted to be a bit more stable/streamlined. Overall, the best way to find all the new content with Flint is to play with him, so get out there and experience it yourself!*
  
11/1/2025: Patch update 2.4.1
  
 *﻿2.4.1 was a minor change involving slight adjustments to Flint's aliases and dialogue, to work more smoothly with the Flint-Thogra interactions mod. Nothing else was changed or added. [i]*[/i]
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/SRlvA01.png)
  
Spoiler**This is a pretty big part of the overall mod, so it has its own category in the glossary. Either of these quests are available to all characters as an optional (albeit, large) part of Flint’s overall story.****﻿﻿These quests are not entirely straightforward, so here you can find a [Quest Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/117YdKI6ZSSKEyBIzb1P_ihNjed__gk_Te7ErKRv6ZrE/edit?usp=sharing) that details every aspect of the quest and can walk you along if you’re struggling to play it correctly. *PLEASE READ THE GUIDE LINKED ABOVE IF YOU ARE HAVING ISSUES WITH THE QUEST!* It has a lot of answers to known bugs or confusing situations, and it'll be a lot easier to consult it instead of going directly to me. 
  
  
I also recommend installing [Dialogue Interface Reshaped](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46546) for either of these quests, as some of the player responses approach the character limit and thus look better/are easier to read with this mod. Not a requirement, just a recommendation from me if you find some of the options to be clogging up the vanilla dialogue menu.** **﻿Either quest can be started by reaching Relationship Rank 450 with Flint** - talk to Flint, and he'll remark that your blocking skills are lacking. Following this conversation, he'll talk to you again at Relationship Rank 500 and offer you a small sum of gold. After *this* conversation, you'll begin the relationship intro quest, More Than a Monster. At the end of this quest you'll get the opportunity to choose friendship or romance and pursue one (or both, eventually) based on your choices within. A brief overview for both can be seen here, but if you want to know more before jumping in, I highly suggest reading the guide linked above. Or just play 'em, and see how things go.
  
  
***Romance*** ﻿This quest has a total of four “paths” and six “endings”. Each route and ending are spiritually similar, but the nature and context of them all is different. Likewise you’re not fully locked into any path necessarily, but the further you delve into any of them, the harder it’ll be to change tracks down the line. 
  
 There are far more ways to fail than to succeed here, so it’s important to pay attention to your options and weigh the consequences to achieve the right path. Even a little too far in the wrong direction can cause Flint to lose trust in you – possibly forever. Likewise there’s a lot of wiggle room to play things your own way and feel the quest out in a playstyle that works for you. There’s no time limit or hard-set rules, so feel free to play at whatever pace and format you prefer. The quest itself is very player-driven and many of the smaller details are left intentionally unclear to simulate a challenging and complicated relationship. It’s meant to feel like more than just a set of objectives on a computer screen – it’s meant to be a real connection between you and him. Following the successful completion of the romance quest, you can also talk to him about an optional marriage quest that serves as a little icing on the cake.
  
 ﻿Unless you’re doing the Passion route, or if you successfully complete the quest and ask it of him, physical intimacy or sex is never shown or implied. Even in the aforementioned cases, they involve soundless fade-to-black scenes and therefore leave it up to imagination.
  
  
***Friendship***
  
 This quest by comparison only has two "routes" and two "endings", that being success or failure. Where it differs from the romance, however, is that you have several choices along the way that can still lead to the same place. Friendship is an easier concept to grasp for Flint, so it's not nearly as difficult - the emphasis was therefore put on player choice and perspective throughout. While there are wrong answers, there are also many right answers and more than one set of choices to make in order to succeed (or fail). Conversations can have up to four or five different ways of ending, and while they might mostly have the same end result, the content of such is far different. You'll also have a chance at gameplay variety - some stages involve long, detailed talks, while others involve combat or item retrieval. It should take you to various places in Skyrim and cover a multitude of topics.
  
 ﻿The quest also differs from the romance in that it's more objective-guided. The romance sort of drops you in and lets you figure it out on your own, whereas this quest will usually tell you what to do and where to go. It's meant to be easier to figure out and complete than the romance, but with an equal amount of personal growth and journey alongside it.
  
  
 ﻿**You can do both quests in the same save file!** I highly recommend you consult the guide if you're looking into it, but you can take a friends-to-lovers or lovers-to-friends route if you want. While you won't get the full experience of both quests if you do, you can transition between them at specific points if you wish to see both possibilities or experience a relationship that develops differently over time. If you want to do friendship-into-romance, be sure to talk to him about your relationship after successfully completing the friendship. If you want to do romance-into-friendship, tell him you'd prefer a simpler relationship after he reconciles from his outburst.
  
  
Content Warning: [spoiler]While these quests are largely pretty safe, they do briefly touch on themes of self-harm, suicide, and child abuse. Flint can (and will) get angry at various points, and will end up yelling at you or being overly aggressive - the nature of his outbursts and anger may be triggering for some. There’s also a fair bit of profanity and the implication of sexual intercourse during the romance quest, depending on the choices you make.
  
[/spoiler]

[left] ﻿Spoiler**Flint is open perms for ordinary patches that are straightforward**, like COTN or HIMBO or anything like that. Likewise things like small changes, replacers, and so on are also open perms. If you're planning on doing something larger, like giving him more dialogue or adding him to a certain mod, I would prefer you join my server and contact me that way, so that we can discuss how that would work out. Likewise if you want to upload him to other sites - in his current or any altered version - I want to be aware of it first. Flint uses assets from a multitude of other mods, so I give credit to the authors of those mods; otherwise his appearance and composition is all my own. Above all else please be respectful of my work, and if you aren't sure, it's best to reach out to me and clarify any questions you may have. I'm willing to work with the community and be open to suggestions, so long as I approve of them first. 
  
 ﻿**I do not approve of using AI to replicate Flint's voice. This includes any kind of AI usage in regards to him - such as AI Follower Framework, ElevenLabs, nothing of that variety is allowed. I take this very seriously as I would consider any copying of my voice to be plagiarism and very unwelcome in my community. I also do not approve of any more DBVO packs going forward.**If something requires his voice, and I approve of its nature, I would much rather do it myself than have AI copy my voice. Please do not make any AI content of him, especially outside my knowledge, as I will ask for it to be taken down otherwise. I promise I'm not hard to get in contact with, it'd be a lot more courteous if you message me about things you may want to do instead of just going ahead without any consent or review from my end. [/left]*![](https://i.imgur.com/f4ggFwh.png)*[left] Spoiler﻿If you’ve gotten this far, wow. You’re an avid reader. Or you just skipped to the bottom, but whatever. Thanks for taking the time to look through all of this.
  
 ﻿Flint is indeed still in the works, and I try to add things to him as often as I can while juggling all the aspects of my personal life. I want to make him as detailed as possible, so he has something to say on practically everything. At the same time, I want to maintain his character and keep him unique, while still having all the aspects that make a great follower. All of that taken into account, here’s my (general) plan for what I intend to include for more updates and the foreseeable future:
  
  

  
* Interactions (for other followers and some vanilla NPCs)
A large quest that expands on Flint's past, telling stories about his family, tribe, and where he truly came from
  
* ~~A romance quest that allows you to really get to know Flint and his inner thoughts~~ *Included in update 2.2.0, expanded on in 2.3.0*
~~A friendship quest that likewise explores his inner thoughts and who he is~~ *Included in update 2.4.0*
  
* ~~A “Let’s stop and rest here” system~~ *Included in update 2.1.0*
~~A “This is your new home” system (so he doesn’t go back to the jail when you dismiss him)~~ *Included in update 2.1.0*
  
* ~~More detailed relationship effects/conditions~~ *Included in update 2.2.0*
Comments on (most) every major quest and questline in vanilla
  
* Scattered idles and thoughts for BS Bruma, Mihail’s Minotaurs, Solstheim and otherwise
~~Comments on players’ race, equipment, class, stats, etc.~~ *Included in update 2.3.0*
  
* ~~Custom body mesh (for personal customization)~~ *Included in update 2.1.0*
General expansion of topics and world knowledge
  
* ~~More context-aware conditional/”How are you feeling” dialogue~~ *Included in update 2.2.0*

These aren’t in any particular order or necessity, and I’ll cross these off the list as I complete them and/or gradually update Flint. As always, I’m willing to listen to the community and if enough people are asking for a feature, I’ll consider implementing it. In the future I’ll try to update him every few months, adding a small handful of the features listed above at a time, until I’ve got him to the condition I want him at. I’ll still keep working hard to deliver more to the community, and even though I have a rather small following and am somewhat unskilled by most standards, I really really appreciate the support from you guys that I’ve gotten. I didn’t really think he’d be very popular, so it warms my heart to hear how much some people enjoy him. [/left]
