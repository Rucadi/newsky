Here are a bunch of visual tweaks I've made for [my favourite follower](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1461?tab=images) on the Nexus!
  
  
I've converted his head to high poly, added a hair colour just for him, as well as made some tweaks to his face markings and face shape, without straying too far from his original look. I also changed the texture of his eyes to an eye texture from [The Eyes of Beauty](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16185?tab=images). Hopefully this is to some people's tastes.
  
  
I've made a version using [Beast Hair Horn and Beard](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22504)﻿, which gives Inigo a modified version of the great Khajiit hair from Saerileth, also found [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22486). I received permissions from Mharlek to include it as standalone in this mod, and Saerileth has added blanket permissions on all of their mods so long as they are credited.
  
A second version retains Inigo's "vanilla" hair, just changing the colour.
  
I've also uploaded a Racemenu preset, in case people want to play as Inigo! (will require [High Poly Head](https://vectorplexus.com/files/file/283-high-poly-head/), or it'll go wacky)[/left]

If the blue doesn't look quite right in your setup, you can edit this in CK. Load up this mod, navigate to Miscellaneous-> ColorForm -> UniqueDarkBlue and you can edit the colour. You can check how it looks by going to Actors -> Inigounique, and clicking on preview head. Once the colour is how you want it, highlight Inigounique in the menu and press ctrl+f4 to generate the facegen files. Wait for a message box to appear saying "Done.", save the plugin and you should be good to go! Hope this helps!
  
  
If you don't like his glowing eyes (imo the colour looks better with glowing meshes), you can load the esp up in CK and export his facegen files with ctrl f4. [/left]
