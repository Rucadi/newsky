“I was but a boy when I first gazed upon the Knight of the Void. I remember the day as if it was only a moon ago… Their eyes behind their helm, which adorned the text of Oblivion, were non-existent… From their back, they retrieved something covered in cloth soaked in blood. While before each of their movements was slow and steady, now they tossed the ball-shaped package to the Jarl’s feet. 
  
As it tumbled and rolled onto the wooden floor the cloth snagged on it and unraveled with each rotation. By the time the ball had stopped right in front of the throne, its content revealed the head of a nearby bandit chief... After receiving their bounty, the figure simply turned and left… 
  
As a man growing his greys, I wonder where this Knight of the Void rests. I wonder what they truly are. Man? Daedra? Something else entirely? What is it they seek, or is it simply gold they cherish? If the Knight of the Void ever reads this, I wish them to know the power they possess.”

* A quieter companion. She may not speak much, but when she does it’s a sign of trust.
770+ Lines
  
* Detailed Backstory (Go to the temple of Mara with the Knight to begin.)
Summoning Spell 
  
* Tracker
Custom Mount, weapon, and armor.
  
* Infinite inventory space
Multiple ways to hire her (But beware, not all options may give you the outcome you want.)
  
* Resting Options (Hang out with the Knight to ask her questions about herself, answer questions about yourself, and hear stories from her journeys!)
Set Home
  
* Main Quest Commentary, and lite commentary on all other major questlines (except Dragonborn)
(Very) Short Romantic sidequest
  
* Three other sidequests (One about getting the Knight her own house, buying her a gift, and confronting demons from her past.)
Her own beliefs and morals. If you do or are something against her beliefs she may attack you. If you are mean to her, you will lose the chance to ever gain her trust. This is not all in stone however as the player can at some points help her find common ground with the player.
  
* Shattered patch

Keep in mind, that some features are only available once you have befriended the Knight. Including setting home, her summoning spell, resting, and romance.

The Knight was made with a desire to have a follower for a more grimdark, somber, and quiet playthrough. I love making talkative followers, but it ruins the vibe when they spout a funny joke as we’re standing next to a tree of hanged men. 
  
The Knight of the Void is there to fix that. They have no idle lines and most of their dialogue is in Hellos, combat, and conversations. 
  
Also, again, the knight was made for a grimdark playthrough. They are a very depressing character in not just their past, but how they carry themselves and what they speak of. 
  
  
Would the Knight fit my playthrough?
  
 The Knight plays the role of a mercenary/paladin. Her fighting style is a spell sword with her own sword that can’t be switched out. She is a worshipper of Mara and loathes Daedra! However, if you gain her trust, in some instances you can get her to see that not all Daedra are bad. Mainly, this Knight works best for a neutral or good Dragonborn and not an evil one. 
  
  
Compatibility: 
  
 While I haven't been able to test too much mod compatibility wise, I know she is compatible with JK's Dragonsreach. I have yet to test other mods, but this mod has references in: Dragons Reach, Temple of Mara, Radiant Rainment, Shrine of Dagon Exterior, and Hamvir's Rest. If you find a compatibility issue, please let me know!

Other Mod Notes:
  

  
* ﻿If you have Read the Room with follower tracking enabled, the Knight may take off her helmet at random times.
﻿Be wary trying different Follower system mods on her as it can break her mind. (She is blacklisted from AFT though.)

FAQ:
  
**How do I get started?**
  
 Simply go to Dragonsreach in Whiterun and there will be a book at one of the main tables. (Left one walking in.) 
  
**Do they have a questline at the moment?**
  
 While they do have multiple sidequests. They do not have a bigger questline at the moment. But this is something I \*really\* want to add in the future as the backstory you learn about the Knight is only scratching the very tip of the iceberg. 
  
  
**Are they lore-friendly?** Yes! I went down a lore rabbit hole to ensure everything is lore-friendly. I looked at in-lore events to build their backstory. These events and details range from Battlespire to Oblivion, and ESO. (Though some did not have dates or specific details where I needed to get creative.) Though I wouldn’t doubt there’s a chance I messed up somewhere if at the least it is all lore-compatible. 
  
  
**Are they romanceable?** Somewhat. You can talk to her about it, but… (Spoilers: It won’t go anywhere at the moment due to the knight’s feelings.) 
  
  
**Their romance is so short!** Yes. But that is because her romance is meant to just be about romantic conversations. All her friendship features are part of that romance, but not explicitly. This is meant to be a follower who you can romance, but it is not the focus of this mod. 
  
  
**I can't change her armor!**
  
 This is not a bug. The Knight will only wear her armor, and a certain dress later on. This isn't something I plan on changing as it wouldn't make sense in her story to wear whatever she, or the player, wants. 
  
  
**The way they speak is weird!**
  
 Due to parts and time periods of their past, I wanted to have fun with how they speak; to make them more alien to not just Skyrim, but the current world of Nirn. 
  
  
**How do I start the various quests?** ﻿Spoiler The Knight has a few quests the player can go through. While some start on their own, other's require the player to be at a certain place. Here are the following notes for the various quests:
  

  
* Friendship Quest / Backstory Quest: Take the Knight to the Temple of Mara. Speak to her in there which will start up a scene. Afterwards, talk to her about it. [Spoiler] If you are too aggressive about her telling you about what happened she will refuse and lock you out of ever being her friend.
 After she tells you the first part of her past, her next dialogues are each between a day until she reaches towards the end and map markers tell you what to do. 
  
Romance Quest: After becoming her friend and she tells you her past just wear an amulet of Mara in front of her. Asking if she is interested will start the romance. She has 3 more conversations over the romance after this. The first one takes place 48 hours after the first conversations. Then the next 72 hours after that one. And finally 96 hours after the last. Spoiler If you pick a mean option while she shows you her face it will end the romance. 
  
- Sidequest 1 / House Quest: Starts up 24 hour after becoming her friend. The whole quest is guided with map markers. If you have her assigned to a home and do this quest, she will start living in her new home and will need to reassign her to your place.
Sidequest 2 / Dress Up!: After becoming the Knight's friend, talk to her in Solitude which will start up a quest to get her a dress. Map markers will guide you. After getting the dress, head to her home and tell her to wear it there.
  
- Sidequest 3 / Old Love, Old Hate: Takes place 144 hours after befriending the Knight. Must be outside in the Tamriel worldspace for it to trigger. Map Markers will lead you through the rest of the quest. [/Spoiler]
  
**I found a bug.** Oh no! I’m so sorry! Let me know in the bug section and I’ll try to find a fix as soon as possible!
  
  
**I have a suggestion.** I’d love to hear it! Let me know in the comments or on the Sidekicks of Tamriel Discord!
