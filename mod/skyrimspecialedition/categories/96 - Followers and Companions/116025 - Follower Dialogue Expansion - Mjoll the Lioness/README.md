This mod is part of my series to renovate vanilla characters with additional depth, unique history or personality, and immersive and detailed interaction.
  
  
  
*"I can never allow my friends to live under such terror. No, I'd sooner charge into Maven's house and strike her down!"*
  
  
  
**How is Mjoll envisioned and touched on in this mod:**
  
  
In this mod, Mjoll is expanded as a **courageous and selfless heroine** who embodies kindness, courage, and friendship. One can say she is a **classical female protagonist.** She places the safety and well-being of her allies above all else, making her **one of the most altruistic figures in all of Skyrim.**
  
  
Mjoll followed in her father's footsteps, traveling across Tamriel and becoming a renowned fighter. However, her journey took a tragic turn when she faced a setback in a treacherous Dwemer ruin. After her rescue, she settled in Riften, only to find it a den of corruption. **The heroine in her demanded action,** and she stayed to fight for her friends against Maven Black-Briar's lackeys.
  
  
The player can recruit Mjoll after helping her retrieve the sword she lost in the Dwemer ruin. **Should the player join the Thieves Guild, Mjoll will acknowledge it** but still hope that they can set things right.
  
  
In the mod, Mjoll has a **kind, brave, and altruistic demeanor,** serving as a shield between the vulnerable and the vulture-like corruption of Riften. She is one of the strongest fighters among all followers, specializing in two-handed weapons and heavy armor, making her a formidable ally in battle.
