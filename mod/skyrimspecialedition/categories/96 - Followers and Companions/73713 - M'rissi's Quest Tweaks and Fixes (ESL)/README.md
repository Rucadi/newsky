[font=Trebuchet MS][size=2]TLDR: M'rissi's quest rewards will be more balanced, and/or useful, some bugs were fixed, and the difficulty of a few things in the quests was rebalanced to be fairer.[/size]Try it if you like M'rissi[size=3]
  
  

------------

  

**Rewards**

  
[/size][/font]

  
* [font=Trebuchet MS]**Albret** (merchant)**:** will have 10K gold for trading, and will sell **a much varied selection of items,** including ingredients, weapons, armor, staves, jewelry, scrolls, etc.[/font]

  
* [font=Trebuchet MS]**Sleep bonuses** toned down slightly, they were too high and it was too easy to reapply them. This applies to all rewards, which included things like quadrupling the size of sweet spot from locks, and giving you 20% resistance to frost magic (on top of normal resistance).[/font]

  
* [font=Trebuchet MS]**Isael** and **Teleria** no longer have lootable **Daedric**/**Ebony** daggers, and thus giving you effort-free access to high-tier items.[/font]

  
* [font=Trebuchet MS]**Summon M'rissi**: spell cost reduced to 25 and is cast silently, reducing the chances it alerts enemies.[/font]

  
* [font=Trebuchet MS]**New food items**: these items were rebalanced, reducing OP effects such as 200 Magic Fortify and improving mild bonuses, lasting for a relatively shorter amount of time (all of them last for over an hour except a 30 minute one).[/font]

**[size=5]Quests**

  
[/size][/font]

  
* [font=Trebuchet MS]**Isael/Nightmare** have a **95%** bonus to all magic damage. That**,** coupled with total immunity to stagger, a massive amount of magicka, and the ability to spam dual-cast chain lightning, made the difficult slightly off in terms of challenge as far as I'm concerned. I fixed this by toning down a bit the magic damage and adding more relevant perks**.** There is a small counter[size=3]balance to this: they start-off at level 25, and they're always 150% your current level, up to level 200. I don't like the straight immunity to stagger, but hopefully this makes the fight easier to defend against without being OP.[/size][/font]
    
  [font=Trebuchet MS][/font]

  
* [font=Trebuchet MS]**Teleria** slightly rebalanced to act as a much weaker Isael (which seemed the original intent anyway), with the counterbalance that she doesn't have to rely on Thunderbolt exclusively, and therefore depleting magicka quickly (has access to Chain Lighting).[/font]

  
* [font=Trebuchet MS]**Khajiit party leader** is significantly tougher, though this only really matters if you're planning to be an irredeemable bastard in her questline. [/font]

  
* [font=Trebuchet MS]The **nightmare** quest was extremely harsh as to required skill levels to succeed. Except a couple of choices, they all required a skill **higher than 90** in the respective skills to pass. I toned that down by making them **higher or equal to 60**, as well as adding the possibility of passing the first check if you have >= 200 Stamina during the oneiric adventure.[/font]

  
* [font=Trebuchet MS]The marriage "**Sincerity**" ring no longer kills you when under 15% health, now it only takes 10% of all your stats if you can survive it, otherwise, it doesn't trigger, nor does it activate the cooldown. Additionally, it fully heals M'rissi and restores half her Stamina, instead of using the "Avoid Death" spell, and restores the 6h cooldown, which was missing.[/font]

  
* [font=Trebuchet MS]"Eternity" ring of marriage paralysis effect is no longer just using the vanilla spell **Mass Paralysis**. Now it always causes 10s of paralysis, bypassing resistances.[/font]

  
  
[font=Trebuchet MS]**[size=5]Tangential stuff**
  
[/size][/font]

  
* [font=Trebuchet MS]**Albret** and **S'hara's** level were set to 10. Since they are "**citizen**" type NPCs that do not fight and most NPCs of this sort are level 10 or below, I changed it to make sure other mods that make the same assumption play together better. [/font]

  
* [font=Trebuchet MS]**Albret** is also now marked as **Protected** to avoid accidental freak accidents in the inn.[/font]

  
* [font=Trebuchet MS]Clarified the description for sleeping together as a slaver.[/font]

  
* [font=Trebuchet MS][font=Trebuchet MS][size=3]Cleaned up the magic effects, spells and their descriptions.[/font][/size][/font]

That's all for now. Happy adventuring.
