Laci is a fully voiced, immersive companion with a soft personality, subtle Deredere style dialogue, and an unshakable fixation on her "Master." 
  
  
Suffering from memory loss you'll eventually piece together she is actually not even really alive. She doesn't know where she came from, or how she even got here. You do get the feeling she is not from this world though.
  
Don't keep her up past sundown, she tends to become a bit possessive and [obsessive.](https://i.imgur.com/JVuVy0B.jpeg)﻿

**I s****howed ThefaceSculptor images of a cute face and a Sour grape Vape and he came up with Laci.﻿**
  
﻿
  
**﻿She has a FOMOD with 5 of each option, Hair ,Eyes , Makeup**
  
You can find her in Whiterun waiting for you at Dragonsreach (Moorside Brothel if you are using Immersive Collection), She is a Archer and is best utilized with [Nethers Follower framework.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55653?tab=files)﻿Her intro is not written yet.

**Casual Commentary: No quest reactions her dialogue is focused on general game play moments, follower commands, and observations about the world.
  
  
Environmental Awareness
  
  
Personality: A bit nervous but extremely eager to prove herself as a capable companion, 
  
  
  
Role: She's supposed to be your main ranged damage dealer, I highly suggest giving her the glass variant of this [weapon mod.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/145949)﻿ Which is featured in many of her screenshots. It's also funny to see since she is .94 scaled.

RSV is known to create black face or bald followers there is a sticky on what to do in Discord solved by another user.
  
  
She uses SMP hair so you need those required mods
  
  
CONFLICTS WITH SHADOWMANS NPC'S OR HIS MODS: These are not real conflicts, Shadowman created the scripts for Laci and are the same as many of his other mods so you probably have those
  
installed. Just load her files last its fine.
  
  
You do NOT need a sex framework to use Laci, but in future updates you won't have any scenes with her.
  
  
[b]I hate AI it took our jobzz: Only download the main file listed follower then enjoy vanilla voice :)**

All praise The Shadowman
  
  
Know that I am not unmindful of thy labour, nor ungrateful for thy steady hand. That which is wrought in silence oft bears the finest fruit, and so it is with thee. Laci, now shaped and set upon her path, owes no small part of her making to thy craft and care. Were I to count the hours or weigh the merit, I should find myself in debt still.
