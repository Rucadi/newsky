*Preface*
  
  
This will be my last mod. I will continue screenshotting, but modding Skyrim is just taking too much time out of my real life.
  
  
I want to say a very hearty thank you to all of you who have supported me over the past years. It's been an absolute pleasure to have you guys along with me throughout my time modding. Couldn't have done it with out you lovely people!
  
  
With that out of the way, let's get back to the mod!
  
  
I've included three new followers and an old follower that lives up to my current standards. My UUNP preset is also pre-applied to them. To describe it, it's aimed to be very exaggerated in the waist, hip, and butt areas. *Thicc* if you will.﻿﻿﻿
  
  
Additional details are listed in spoilers. All followers level with player, with no cap.
  
  
Got screenshots or videos that you want to share? Freely upload them to the image or video section of this mod; I can't wait to see them!

Eitra
  
  
Special Notes: If you have my original Eitra mod installed, install Follower Fever, then transfer old Eitra's gear over to the new Eitra NPC. After that, it is safe to uninstall the old Eitra follower mod (unless you want two Eitras running around).
