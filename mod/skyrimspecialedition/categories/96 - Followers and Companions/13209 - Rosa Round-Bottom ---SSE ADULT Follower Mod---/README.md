Fair warning! Mod and images contained therein are of an adult nature. Armor is intentionally and GRATUITOUSLY SKIMPY and is in NO WAY intended to maintain realism or lore friendliness. If your offended by adult mods in general and are somehow viewing this, DON'T PANIC! Calm down breath slowly, and turn on your adult filter function in your profile settings. It's okay I can be patient. Once you taken care of that little detail, enjoy your perversion-free time here on the Nexus (and let those of us who like such things just be).
  
  
Just saying...

**ABOUT THE MOD(S)**
  
  
-Rosa the Follower-
  
Here to join you again for all your new adventures in Skyrim is everyone's favorite half naked barbarian warrior; Rosa! A bit more than just a simple port, Rosa also comes sporting that brand spanking new CBBE SSE body, making here among the first standalone followers to use this fantastic new body. Even in SSE Rosa still packs quite a wallop and if you dare, is also quite eligible for marriage.
  
  
  
-The Brazen Armor set-
  
Available is a completely revamped Brazen Dragonbone Heavy Armor set for your Dragonborn to don themselves with. The armor is available for both CBBE SSE and for UUNP Bodyslide. Male support (uses SOS Body) also available.
  
  
The armor can now be made in any forge, provided you have the Dragonsmithing perk.
  
  
...or you can be a dirty little cheat and type ---help "brazen"--- in the console commands. =P
  
  
If you use other mods like the Dragonbone Marauder and Bikini sets, you'll notice this armor shares some modularity with them. So don't be afraid to mix and match with the pieces!
  
  
  
**WHERE TO FIND HER**
  
  
You can still find her at Angi's Camp, just south of Falkreath, high up in the Jerall Mountains. Why so far up there? Because why not. =P
  
  
  
  
**KNOW ISSUES/INCOMPATIBILITIES**
  
  
  
-Because the armor mod has been revamped to function like a NiseTanaka style bikini armor,
  
this will conflict with mods like "Devious Devices" or "Dual Sheath Redux".
  
  
For any SOS users, please enable the "Revealing Option" in the SOS MCM menu.
  
  
For any who use Devious Devices, please use  the "Device Hider"" option in the mod's MCM menu.
  
  
 -Rosa's outfit will not change if you already saved after meeting her, then tried to reinstall her with different dress options from the FOMOD. You'll need to uninstall the mod, load your game with out Rosa then save again, then re-install and she appear as you have chosen.
  
  
  
-Depending on your choice of lighting mods, Rosa might appear ***much different*** than shown (SkyrimSE Re-Engaged ENB was used when taking these screens).
  
  
-Currently still incompatible with mods that turn followers into werewolves, this is likely due to Rosa using a custom race setup.
  
  
-If your using follower overhaul mods, please make sure to have the RosaFollower.esp file (or ANY follower .esp file) BELOW any of those
  
follower overhaul mods in your load order.
  
  
-Loading Rosa's oldrim Racemenu .jslot can sometimes leave your character blue in the skin.
  
Just navigate the "Body Paint" tab in Racemenu and change the color/texture to a more neutral color. Changing the selected texture helps too.

[Schlongs of Skyrim SE](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5355-schlongs-of-skyrim-se/)- Needed if you plan on using the armor for male characters.
  
  
  
**...oh and DON'T FORGET to check the requirements for the above mods as well!**
  
  
**Qu and Ah**
  
  
Q. Where's the Preset File so I can play as Rosa?
  
  
A. Now that [Racemenu is totally a thing now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYaToSdStE0&t)﻿﻿, you can use the oldrim preset/exported head file. Just understand that her eyes or hair won't load as her hair mod has yet (if ever) to ever see a port. Her eyes should be an easy fix, as there are many eye mods that have purple in them to make for a decent substitute.

Q. Hey man I'm not quite digging the armor she comes with, is there any way I can access her inventory and just dress her myself?
  
  
 A. Indeed there is but you'll to download a follower rework mod to accomplish this. There's [Extensible Follower Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7003), [Immersive Amazing Follower Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14722), and [Ultimate Follower Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10681) (last one I personally use). I know for some it's not an ideal solution for some of you, but hey if it works right? ?
  
  
-
  
  
Q. How can I make Rosa totally naked?
  
  
A. You can use a targeted console command then type "removeallitems" without quotes in the console commands. Also follower overhaul mods work great too when you want to remove some items or dress her yourself.
  
  
-
  
  
Q. I really like Rosa's body type! Can you provide the bodyslide preset file used for her please?
  
  
A. Sure! Its already included with the follower mod as a bonus file.
  
  
-
  
  
Q. Okay so I'm totally digging Rosa but not here nakedness. Is there a way to make her more modest with her armor?
  
Also my friend here likes her nakedness and want to know if its possible to make her more naked WITH her armor too?
  
  
A.With the modern conveniences of a FOMOD installer, you can now choose which option you want for Rosa to dress when installing the mod.
  
  
-
  
  
Q. HELP! I loaded in Rosa's oldrim Racemenu Preset and her skin is BLUE! How do I fix it?
  
  
A. Easy! Just navigate the "Body Paint" tab in Racemenu and change the color/texture to something neutral and BAM no more blue.

Q. HEY MAN! I liked her the old versions of Rosa and her armor!
  
  
No worries! The [legacy files can all be found here.](https://mega.nz/folder/1pcBXaaQ#fPojh0njLXmSdgs0xn_hzw)﻿
