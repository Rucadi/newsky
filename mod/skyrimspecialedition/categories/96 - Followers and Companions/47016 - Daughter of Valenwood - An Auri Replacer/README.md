**[color=#f1c232][b]****A[size=4]s of Song of the Green 2.1, the Daughter of Valenwood replacer has been officially integrated into the original mod!****[b]If you've installed my mod previously and are updating to Song of the Green 2.1, you** [/b]**[b]must** [/b]**[b]remove the old (1.4 and below) version of Daughter of Valenwood. You don't need it anymore.
  
  
For those who've used this mod before and like some of the options, or are new and want some more visual options, you can download the new 2.1 version of Daughter of Valenwood. No plugins necessary.**[/b]**[b]**[/b][/size][/color][/b]**[b][color=#00ffff][size=3][b]What this mod does now:
  
Adds options for alternate eye, hair and teeth textures, as well as alternate horns/antlers and the option to remove the horns entirely. Plus a CBBE texture patch.** [/b][/b][/size][/color]**[color=#ffffff][size=2][b][b]**[/b]Note: I've changed the version numbers of this mod to match those of Song of the Green. Makes it less confusing imo.[color=#f1c232]

**Update 2.1**

  
* **Compatibility with version 2.1 of Song of the Green**
**Forwards the eye texture, horns/antlers, teeth texture, and hair texture options from the previous versions to v2.1**
  
* **CBBE texture patch, since Song of the Green 2.1 uses the UNP/vanilla compatible textures by default**

  
The talky-talky bits[/size][/color]:[/b]
  
I'm low-key proud of this title image I made﻿﻿﻿
  
  
My goal for this was to make an "updated," High Poly Head version of Auri's appearance without changing her so much that she no longer looked like Auri. So, I took a few screenshots of Auri's original face and used it as a reference when making my own. This is my first real NPC face replacer, and thanks to Enroys for linking me to the one Racemenu to NPC tutorial that actually worked for me, as well as Kalilies for making that amazing tutorial in the first place, I was finally able to make this mod. This mod was made primarily for myself, but I figured other people might want to use it too (I've had some other people express interest in it).
  
  
If you look closely at some of the screenshots, you may notice that Auri has star-shaped pupils. This is the way Bosmer eyes look in The Elder Scrolls Online, and since Auri's original appearance was inspired by ESO Bosmer I thought it was fitting to include those style of eyes in my mod. I know they may not be for everyone, so I've also included the more ordinary style eye textures in the FOMOD as a choice, along with green variants for both eye types since green eyes seem to be quite popular in other Auri replacers.
  
  
Options for body type (CBBE, vanilla or UNP), hair textures, and teeth textures are also included in the FOMOD. If you use CBBE, choose CBBE so Auri uses your body meshes. If you use UNP or you don't use any female body mods, choose UNP. This mod only adds body textures to prevent seams/mismatch.
  
  
Also, I know the file size looks quite big, but I'm not really how else to decrease it since it uses FOMOD.
  
  
Another thing I should note is that Auri may look a tad bit different based on your own ENB setup. My old screenshots are with Rudy ENB for Cathedral Weathers. The new shots for version 2.0 were taken with a custom FNENB
  
  
~~Side note: it took me a long ass time just thinking of a name for this mod, let alone choosing what images to show and in what order. Why am I so indecisive~~
  
  
**What this mod does:**
  

  
* Replaces Auri's face from Song of the Green with a High Poly Head version that still looks faithful to the original (to me at least)
Gives her 4K HD Bijin Skin textures (optional 2K textures included)
  
* Keeps her height the same but changes her weight to 72 (The weight looks fine to me based on the vanilla shaped body)
Auri uses whatever skin specular textures you use, so if you use wet/sweaty skin textures Auri will match (it shouldn't matter if you use Bijin textures or not due to the nature of specular maps)
  
* Adds sharp teeth or normal teeth, depending on your choice.
Adds original KS hair textures or Salt and Wind, depending on your choice
  
* Adds six different eye textures to choose from.
Adds options for 3 different types of antlers
  

**This mod contains an ESP.
  
  
Now includes a face preset for RaceMenu. (this is now outdated, but still close enough to the new version)**
  
**Installation:**
  

  
1. Install Song of the Green by Waribiki
Install this mod with a mod manager and follow the FOMOD instructions.
  
2. For the love of Akatosh, Arkay, Dibella, Julianos, Kynareth, Mara, Stendarr, ~~Talos,~~ and Zenithar, **please make sure this mod loads AFTER Song of the Green (018Auri.esp) unless you want Auri to look like a butt-face. If you load it before, Auri won't look like Auri at all. She won't use her original face or my replacer version. She'll use the CK edited version that isn't meant to be seen,or she'll get the dark face bug.**

  
**Face Preset Installation:**Install the required mods:
  

  
* ﻿[RaceMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19080)﻿
﻿[High Poly Head](https://vectorplexus.com/files/file/283-high-poly-head/) (choose the Aesthetic Elves version, otherwise she won't look right)
  
* ﻿[KS Hairdos SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6817) (female or complete package)
﻿[Kalilies Brows](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40595) (brows will be darker than on the npc)

* [﻿Authentic Eyes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36063) (I've included my edited eye diffuse textures, but you still need the rest of the eye textures from here otherwise the eyes won't look right)

Install one of my two preset options like any other mod. Make sure it overwrites Authentic Eyes.
