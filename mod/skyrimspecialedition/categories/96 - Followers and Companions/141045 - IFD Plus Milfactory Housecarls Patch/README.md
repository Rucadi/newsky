# IFD Plus Milfactory Housecarls Patch
- Author: VosslerWeiss
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/141045


As the author of IFD - Lydia mentioned in his mod page, any replacers for Lydia will not play nice with his mod. Because his mod changes the voicetype of Lydia to a unique voicetype, and replacers of lydia usually set this to the default voicetype (femaleeventoned). This mod helps with this to make the Milfactory Housecarls mod work with IFD - Lydia mod. So far there are no issues, but this mod will be in very early alpha stage since issues may arise later in the game.
  
  
Unfortunately, you will have to use a save in which you have not gotten Lydia as your housecarl as yet to be able to get her to work properly.
  
  
This mod works for the latest version of [IFD - Lydia](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38473) which is version 4.2.2﻿ and the latest version of [Milfactory Housecarls](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80846) which is version 1.2FE. Older versions and newer versions of both these mods may not work with this patch.
