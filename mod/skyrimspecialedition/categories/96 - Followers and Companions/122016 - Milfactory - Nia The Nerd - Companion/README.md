**"No Nia, you don't need that many books on a field trip"**

Nia is a little Breton mage, who enjoys books more than the company of other people. She recently joined the College of Winterhold and spending most of the time dwelling in the Arcanaeum. She is a bit shy and socially awkward, and sometimes cluless about the world outside. So please take her on an adventure, help her see the beautiful world outside.
  
  
She is the first entry of a new Milfactory series called "Bodacious Candidates".There will be more to come ;)
  
Side note: some of you may notice she looks somewhat familiar, and you are right, she was one of my older design back in 2022, shared among several discords I was a member of. And now she has gone through quite a glowup journey, isn't she?
