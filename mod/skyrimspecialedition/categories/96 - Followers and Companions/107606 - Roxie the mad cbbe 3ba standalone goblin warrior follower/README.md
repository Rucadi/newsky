**Please Read**
  
**I know that not everyone likes female characters having 3rd legs and that sort of thing so no need to worry. She will be a regular female in your game unless you download something such as the no vagina patch. Normies you can skip the next couple of stuff until you see the sex gifs below. If you still don't know what im talking about im talking about the schlong. If you are into that you need the mod trx futanari addon which is on loverslab. ~~T~~~~he options you want to choose for the fomod below is. Any normal map option that says athletic(or sport sexy style should be the same)/ The default diffuse map/ Specular maps non gloss. With these options you shouldn't have a mismatch between the schlong and body.~~Sense i have my own patches on another site you can disregard  the things i crossed out. I have an easier alternate method for this so that you have the [schlongs appear in your mcm menu](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/31390-futanemesislol-followers-schlong-texture-patches-and-schlong-addons/) . Link is offsite, its alot to read but my other mod should be easy to follow. Everything else that i said below such as the picture of the schlong texture you see below is outdated stuff.﻿
  
  
I also forgot to mention..when you give them schlong it may say "This actor was not designed to work with this schlong or its a custom race". What i want you to do is...ignore that warning proceed to giving the goblins the schlong and enjoy the fun bits!
  
~~The image below is the mod you need for the skin patch so its seamless and doesn't have a mismatched color between the body and schlong from~~** [**~~dw vaginaless mod~~**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65546?tab=files)﻿

**Hello everyone this is Roxie she identifies as batshit crazy( she enjoys chopping arms and even heads off a little too much for those who dares tries to harm the dragonborn).....anyway onto the important stuff**
  
About **Roxie the mad**
  
She is a goblin warrior that comes with [Obi's ghoul armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/88090)﻿ (2nd image of my screenshot)and Caenaervon's **[chaos blade](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90892) .
  
She uses vibian's body preset which is basically the other goblin mod i made** **[right here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/105576) just check the optional files.
  
Her voice is female sultry and she can be married. She is espfe which doesn't take a spot in your load order.**The skin she uses is ﻿ **demoniac( not from nexus, its actually from a different site, right click to**[translate page](https://regenbot.tistory.com/152?category=682827)**.) This one actually has a few updates compared to the one on nexus.**
  
**Her default expression and armor is the 2nd image**
  
Remember she is a goblin she is going to be short. The screenshots and sex gifs makes her look taller than she actually is
  
**About the armor
  
If you are having any issues trying to remove the armor [size=4]I recommend to use [Nether follower framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55653) . This allows you to remove her armor easily.
  
  
[/size]Location﻿**

**She is located in dead man's inn drink in** **falkreath**
  
**﻿If for whatever she is not there( or you are just lazy) type in the console command 
  
1.help Roxie (then press enter)
  
2. then type player.placeatme (their reference id) you will find what their reference id is after you did the first step above.
  
An alternate route for this is using the [cheat mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70159)﻿ to summon her to you. Or the mod [Where are you](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76063)****.**
  
  
**A message for others who wants to give her a custom voice to fit her name**
  
**You can do that you have permission, i had an idea in my mind of her sounding a little bit unhinged. I made a video with sound so you can get an idea of [how she can sound](https://www.loverslab.com/blogs/entry/20381-plaping-roxie-the-mad-bubble-butt/)﻿.. But anyway as a wise man once said..."DO WHATEVER the FUCK..you want to do"....mxr**
  
  
**Info for the no vagina patches**
  
**If you prefer that she doesn't have a vagina and just have a pp, Download the patch(that's in my mod). She won't have a vagina as long as there isn't any clothing on the "body" armor slot(like a bra or chestplate).  If you want the schlong texture to match with her skin. I recommend downloading the schlong texture patch from [dw vaginaless mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65546) . This is the same thing that i was refering to above. Remember she uses demoniac skin. So download the demoniac Schlong texture patch. Also remember you are just downloading the schlong texture patch. And nothing else. She will still have a vagina if you just download the schlong texture patch from dw vaginaless mod(for full package futa peeps out there) and if you don't download my no vagina patch that is in my mod****Anyway that's all i hope you enjoy Roxie the mad**
