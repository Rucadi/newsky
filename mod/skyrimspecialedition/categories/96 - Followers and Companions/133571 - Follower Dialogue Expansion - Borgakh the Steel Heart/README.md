This mod is part of my series to renovate vanilla characters with additional depth, unique history or personality, and immersive and detailed interaction.
  
  
  
*"I am not without clan here. In taking me with you, you are my chieftain, now."*
  
  
  
**How is Borgakh envisioned and touched on in this mod:**
  
  
In this mod, Borgakh is expanded as a young Orc warrior who **believes she is destined for greatness**. A true zealot of Malacath, she abides by her people's traditions but also desires more from her life.
  
  
Borgakh grew up in the stronghold of Mor Khazgur, inspired by the stories of her father's exploits in the Empire's wars. She trained hard and pushed herself even harder, aspiring to be a warrior as great as her father. However, as a female Orc, she was expected to marry another chieftain in exchange for supplies, as is the custom of Orcish tribes in Skyrim.
  
  
Though she respects this arrangement, Borgakh cannot shake the feeling that she is meant for more. She **silently awaits her fate, accepting her duty while knowing she will never be content with it.** 
  
  
This changes when the player arrives at Mor Khazgur and persuades her to join them. For the first time, she can pursue her dream of becoming a great warrior - **but can she ever truly break free from the mental shackles of her clan's expectations?**
  
  
As a follower, Borgakh is a strong and capable warrior, specializing in heavy armor and sword-and-shield combat, making her a worthy tank in your party.
  
  
In the mod, Borgakh has a stoic demeanor and a tough, no-nonsense personality. She will share many details about **Orcish culture, religion, and traditions, all of which are rooted in canon lore.** She has great reverence for Malacath, but also an **internal struggle to reconcile her ambitions with her duty to her people.**
