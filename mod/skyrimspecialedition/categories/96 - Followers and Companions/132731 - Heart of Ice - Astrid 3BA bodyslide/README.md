3BA bodyslides for Astrid's body, hands and feet, as well as all of her outfits, so that you can build her to any preset desired.
  
  
To use with oBody, make sure to build using the zeroed sliders preset, and tick the check mark to create morphs.
  
  
**Important information regarding weight sliders:**
  
The original mod disables weight sliders on most of the outfits. By default, Bodyslide generates a high and a low weight mesh, appending a \_1 or a \_0 suffix to the mesh. In most cases, Heart of Ice uses only the \_1 mesh and disables weight sliders in the plugin. This is ok, but since Astrid's body mesh has weight sliders enabled, and a few of the outfits also has weight sliders, I found it more consistent to also enable it for the rest of the outfits.
  
  
It's irrelevant if you don't plan to change Astrid's weight, but one might expect, at some point, people will be making replacers for a popular follower mod, and may give her different weights. Having weight meshes and sliders enabled in the plugin ensures, as a precaution, that the outfits will go along with any weight changes to her body.
  
  
The names used for the underwear meshes didn't include low and high weight suffixes, so I had to generate and include those meshes. You MUST have these meshes installed, or generate underwear with Bodyslide, if you use the weight enabling plugin.
  
  
The ESPFE plugin covers those underwear filenames, as well as enabling weight sliders on all outfits that didn't have them.
  
  
If you prefer not to install the plugin, every outfit generated with Bodyslide will work, except for Astrid's underwear - the game will use the mod's default meshes instead.
  
  
I would, in the future, convert all of these bodyslides to weightless and do away with the plugin, if users or the mod author prefer it that way, and smashman1 changes the rest of the outfits and Astrid's body to consistently use weightless meshes.
