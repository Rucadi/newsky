Violet Everbeautiful is a beautiful (duh) follower created with in detail with custom assets, even the hair has 7 different parts with custom textures! Credits to KS and HG hairdos for certain parts of the texture assets that were used...
  
  
She is a standalone follower, meaning that you do not need to download any extra mods as requirements. Having said that, having expressive facial animation mods would always be beneficial and recommended.
  
  
She can be found in Drunken Huntsman tavern in Whiterun (Right across the blacksmith)
  
She is a 2h axe wielder and she behaves like a berserker.
  
She does not affect stealth meter, is unique and essential.
  
She uses female young eager voice type.
  
  
She wears vanilla Vampire Outfit, but you can of course give her other outfits as well. The outfits you see on screenshots are just examples. There are ton of different options out on Nexus. This mod does not include a custom outfit.
  
  
This mod has been created in a cooperation with CoralineKoralina and me, for a collection i curated. You do not need to have the collection or anything else to run this mod at all.
