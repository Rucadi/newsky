**Eris - Chooey's Choice**
  
**Powered by SkyPatcher**
  
  
✧ This is a high-poly visual replacer for the Eris follower in his [ezPG](https://craftian.itch.io/ezpg)﻿ and [Light and Shade](https://craftian.itch.io/light-and-shade)﻿ mod by Craftian.
  
  
✧ This mod will use Chooey's preferred skin with your body meshes but you can opt to use your own skin mod in the FOMOD installation.
  
  
✧ If there are any visual issues or suggestions, feel free to post them here, and I'll take a look at them when I can.

**F.A.Q:**
  
  
**Q:** Why SkyPatcher?
  
**A:** SkyPatcher released an update that solves load order problems with replacers, that may lead to the black-face bug. Additionally, replacers have become universally compatible with everything (except replacers for the same NPCs, obviously)
  
  
**My public response to private use:**
  
  
> **Because this came up more than once:** you should be able to play this game, the way *YOU* want to. What you do in your own private time and in your own private games is not my concern and I am thankful that you chose to download my mods. The last thing I want to do is ridicule and vilify the same people who enjoy the things I make. 
>   
>   
> I appreciate everyone who voiced their concerns, and while respect is a two-way street, I am not going to go out of my way to dictate what you should be doing on your own computer as that is your own responsibility and domain. You can break apart, change, modify, dismantle and learn from my mods. Just don't re-upload it and follow my permission guidelines that I have on all of my mods.
