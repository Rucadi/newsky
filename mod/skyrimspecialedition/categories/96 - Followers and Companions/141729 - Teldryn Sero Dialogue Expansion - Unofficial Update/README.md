Hello! I wanted to tweak [Teldryn Sero Dialogue Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42434) a bit to reduce the frequency of some of the lines, as well as several other tweaks and fixes I'll list below. All credits go to [Yoiiru](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Yoiiru?gameId=1704) for continuing the project I started years ago. <3
  
  
Details
  
  
- This addon is an **ESPFE** and is in plugin format **1.70**, so it should work with older versions of Skyrim SE.
  
- Altered almost every single dialogue option with new conditions ranging from random percentage rolls, locations, NPCs, and more.
  
  
Tweaked examples include:
  
  

  
* Almost every single idle comment now has a **24 in-game hour cool-down timer**, compared to 3 to 5 hours (average) as to the original.
Almost every single comment now has a **random percentage roll** to lessen the frequency.
  
* Some comments had their location conditions changed to prevent overlap with other idles that were similar.
Some comments had their location conditions expanded upon to include **Dawnguard-related** locations.
  
* Comments that have references to NPCs, such as Heimskr (new!), Rolff Stone-Fist, Grelod the Kind (new!), Argis the Bulwark, etc. have had their **distance triggers increased**.
The new dialogue branches added by the original mod are now restricted to only being accessible while Teldryn is **currently following you**.
  
* The new dialogue branch, "How come you always wear your helmet?" now requires Teldryn to actually be **wearing a helmet** for it to appear.
Removed the quest condition limitation of being prohibited while sneaking. This was done so certain idles were no longer blocked (ie.
  
vampire feeding)
  
Fixed examples include:
  
  

  
* Added a .SEQ file to help ensure the dialogue quest starts every time.
Incorporated the fix provided in the comments section regarding the lover dialogue branch to ensure it appears between. Thank you [Kittni](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/32266335)!
  
* Fixed several conditions that were directed to the player ref instead of the subject (Teldryn).
Fixed capitalization for one line (ie. "Any thoughts? comments?" ---> "Any thoughts? Comments?").
  
* Fixed cannibalism condition trigger, so now certain lines will play if the player has eaten someone.
Fixed nudity condition triggers, so now Teldryn will no longer comment on bareness while the player is in werewolf or vampire lord form.
  

  
- Added 3 new lines left over from my old splicing folder.
  
- Reduced the frequency in Teldryn's vanilla idles to be more in-line with the mod's additions.
  
- Subtitle fixes from [Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch - USSEP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266) have been forwarded, but the mod itself is not required.
  
  
A **combo patch** is available for [Relationship Dialogue Overhaul - RDO SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1187) and [Relationship Dialogue Overhaul - Update and MCM](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44601).
  
  
**NOTE** - I could not for the life of me figure out the scripting to add fade-to-black scenes to the lover dialogue branch responses, nor add Lover's Comfort post-scene. If anyone can figure it out, though, **feel free to share it either here or on a separate page!** That'd be fantastic!

Either one of these mods will allow for the Relationship Rank 4 comments to appear, as in vanilla, you cannot normally trigger them without console commands!
