**Boudiana Ravenscorn**
  
  
A Wyrd Ranger from the remote borderlands of Cyrodiil, Boudiana has arrived in Ivarstead seeking to aid the Stormcloak cause. She has a wonderful Gaelic custom AI generated voice with 735 unique lines, tons of idle comments, some of which change according to the side you pick in the Civil War. She reacts to the Civil War, the Companions questline, and the Hircine/Kynareth/Namira quests. She is friendly and supportive of werewolves, though is not blessed by Hircine herself.

**Boudiana Ravenscorn** is a member of the **Nanselta Wyrd**, a coven of forest dwellers, nature worshippers, and witches that resides in an extremely remote part of the north-east valleys and mountains of Cyrodiil. The Nanselta worship balance in all things, and avoid the trappings of civilization. They venerate **Jephre the Earth-Father**, **Kynareth the Wind-Sister**, **Hircine the Hunt-Brother**, and **Namira the Rot-Mother**. They maintain cordial relations with the other Wyrd clans from Glenmoril to Beldam, though outside of established moots a friendly greeting is not to be expected. The Nanselta have an extremely fraught relationship with the various Cyrodiilic Empires, having lost the vast majority of their lands many centuries ago, the few survivors driven up into the hills and remote vales in which they now dwell. They remain opposed to organized civilization and spurn cities of rock and timber.
  
  
**Boudiana** is a flanking **ranger style combatant** and will alternate between **dual wielding sword and axe**, and finding a good position to **flank with her bow**. She's fierce and relentless, and will not shy away from speaking her mind on things. Having heard of Skyrim's civil war, she left her coven to seek allies in arms against the Empire that has oppressed her people for so long. Though for gameplay reasons (perhaps you did this many hours ago in the playthrough and only did the first quest) she won't refuse to join you or abandon you if you join the Empire, she'll certainly have STRONG opinions about such choices. She is meant for a **Stormcloak** or **Neutral** playthrough, with some extra lines if you're a **Werewolf**.
  
  
Here are a few of her voice lines as examples of what to expect: [Idle Comment A](http://sndup.net/c6yf5) - [Idle Comment B](http://sndup.net/fhv27) - [Idle Comment C](http://sndup.net/zjprb).
  
  
Features:
  
  

  
* Flanking combat style with a mix of dual wield, archery, and stealth friendly gameplay.
Wears light armor - though is initially in a simple monk's robe (to facilitate wearing whatever armor you give her).
  
* Lore-friendly investigation of witch coven / Wyrd perspectives.
A wonderful Gaelic voice that makes me just want to have her around every playthrough
  
* Though Boudiana has neither magical talent nor spells, she will gather reagents and hides as you travel the land with her. Check her inventory from time to time to see what she's gathered.
Compatible with all follower frameworks - I suggest [Nether's Follower Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55653)﻿ to which she'll be automatically imported, though any should work without a patch.
  
* SMP Wig addon that requires [Dint's BDOR Hairs 0.20](https://www.mediafire.com/file/1enjwvkrgv6iq1q/%5BDint999%5D_BDOR_Hairs_SSE_0.20.7z/file)﻿. The link is to the archive which has been posted as "Public" on Dint's Discord (though this link is not to the Discord itself per Nexus rules). The file in Optional Files contains no mesh/texture assets, and is merely an ESL flagged patch with a fires once script to equip her wig.

**FAQ**:
  
  

  
* I'm using an older version of Skyrim and I can't find her, what should I do? Use [Backported Extended ESL Support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441)﻿ (BEES). You are guaranteed to need this moving forward anyways, if you are not going to update to the latest version of Skyrim.
I'm using <Insert Follower Framework> and it's not working properly? Do the steps that the follower framework you are using tells you to do for custom voiced followers. Some will do this automatically (NFF), others will require you do it manually (AFT). It varies by mod.
  
* Her hair doesn't look like the screenshots, why? The screenshots use the SMP wig addon, which is free and available from the [Dint BDOR Hair 0.20](https://www.mediafire.com/file/1enjwvkrgv6iq1q/%5BDint999%5D_BDOR_Hairs_SSE_0.20.7z/file)﻿ archive, which has also been posted as publicly available on Dint's Discord (which routes to the same link).
Who's her voice actress? She uses an AI generated voice, not a human voice actress.
  
* What outfit is she wearing? She is wearing Fuse's [Sona Armor](https://www.patreon.com/posts/hdt-smp-sona-68902488) in most screenshots, which has both [3BA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97486)﻿ and [BHUNP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/123945)﻿ bodyslides available. Some of the screenshots also feature RussianBear's Elegance outfit and H2135's Fantasy Series 6.
How do I install her Uncompressed Audio or No Facepaint addon? Just like you would any other addon, put them in Vortex/MO2 and tell them to override the main mod.﻿
  
* Is this ESL flagged? Yes, this is **ESL Flagged**.
Do you have a Discord channel? Yes, I do. Swing by the [Modharbour Discord](https://discord.gg/ewU53g3r)﻿﻿ if you have ideas, need technical support, or just want to chat.
  
* If the NPCs in your game are bald, that likely means you are using Racial Skin Variance (RSV) or the Nolvus mod list, both of which are known for this issue. There is a patch provided for [Racial Skin Variance (RSV) - SPID](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81668)﻿ in the Optional Files, though Nolvus uses an older and unsupported version of this mod that requires an esp patch - consult the Nolvus author for support.
