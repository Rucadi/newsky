Born in the chaotic depths of Oblivion, Cubbi always stood apart from her kind. While most succubi
  
 thrived on seduction and destruction, she had an unusual talent for
  
healing and ice magic a skill her kin saw as weak and unnatural. Mocked
  
for her “softness” and reluctance to fully embrace her predatory nature,
  
 she spent years searching for her place.
  
  
Curiosity led her to the mortal realm, but what she thought would be an adventure quickly
  
became a nightmare. A failed portal spell left her stranded in a goblin
  
den deep within Fallowstone Cave. Weakened and drained from the spell,
  
she was quickly overwhelmed and captured. Months of torment broke her
  
physically and emotionally, but she clung to survival, using her magic
  
in secret to stay strong and bide her time.
  
  
One desperate night, she finally escaped. With what little strength she had left, she managed
  
 to open another portal just far enough to get outside the cave.
  
Collapsing in the dirt, exhausted and barely conscious, she knew she
  
wouldn’t last long without help.
  
That’s when you arrived.
  
  
Whether by fate or instinct, the moment Cubbi locked eyes with you outside
  
Fallowstone Cave, something inside her clicked. Desperation, survival,
  
or perhaps something deeper before she could even think, she had already
  
 claimed you. A faint pulse of magic, a mark only she understood, and
  
just like that, you weren’t just the first friendly face she had seen in
  
 months. You were hers.
  
  
Her clingy, overly eager personality stems from this moment. The playful, teasing “bestfriend/stepsis” persona she
  
adopts is her way of coping a mix of humor, seduction, and a desperate
  
need to feel wanted and useful. Her healing magic is both her calling
  
and her way of proving she still has value, despite everything she’s
  
been through.
  
  
Cubbi is confident, flirty, and full of innuendos, but behind the banter, there are moments where her past
  
lingers hesitation in dungeons, unease around goblins, or a rare glimpse
  
 of vulnerability. But she won’t let that stop her from being your
  
devoted, eager, and ever entertaining companion.
  
To Cubbi, you’re everything. And she’ll do whatever it takes to make sure you never forget that.[/b]**![](https://i.imgur.com/HRhFH9F.png)﻿
  
[b]****Cubbi is a fully AI voiced companion designed to add personality and
  
humor to your adventures. As a flirtatious, teasing succubus, she
  
thrives on innuendos, ego stroking, and playful banter.**Meant for male players, you can be female but all her lines are written for male. She says "Step bro" and "Bestie".
  
  
[FEMALE PLAYER VERSION HERE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/149637?tab=description)﻿
  
  
Casual Commentary: No quest reactions her dialogue is focused on general game play moments, follower commands, and observations about the world.
  
  
Environmental Awareness: Reacts to inns, player homes, dungeons, and Blood chill Cavern. Also has lines for when she’s drunk and some collision interactions. A separate file will be uploaded to make Bloodchill Cavern a requirement to activate those lines only in Blood chill. She currently has banter with just Serana which can be disabled.
  
  
  
Personality: Confident, witty, and always ready with a suggestive remark, she’ll keep you entertained while sticking close by.
  
  
  
Role: She's supposed to be your main healer, although can also put out decent damage through ice spells she levels with the player. You can get her level 1 she's not overpowered.
  
  
Cubbi doesn’t follow a strict story or progression she’s simply there to enhance the atmosphere with her unique presence. If you’re looking for a lively, flirtatious companion who won’t let a moment go by without a clever comment, she’s the perfect addition to your travels. She does open up to you a little more to explain why she chose you as her best friend but its not a full on story.
  
  
  
When you find her she is naked right outside of Fallowstone Cave near Riften. She is compatible with NFF although I have not tried any other follower manager. I use NFF to give her a healer main role and tell her to loot potions in my game.
  
  
  
  
She is not streamer friendly especially when you're at any player home that's properly tagged in CK. She will say some really explicit things.

I originally wanted a character like this in the game someone flirty, teasing, and full of personality so I decided to write her and share her with others. Cubbi is AI voiced, using a custom model based on my friend's voice. Special thanks to my anonymous friend who let me use her voice as the base data to generate this unique voice. Cubbi is not lore friendly at all. I wrote her as a best friend who has some really weird quirks so if you like lore friendly stuff this isn't for you.
