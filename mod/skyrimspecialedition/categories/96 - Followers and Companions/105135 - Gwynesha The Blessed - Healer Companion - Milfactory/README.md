**"Sweet mother of Dibella.
  
Are you a believer now?"**

Gwynesha is a priestess of Dibella, mastered in the magic school of restoration, and the Dibellan Arts, of course. She gained the title "The Blessed" for her powerful spells as well as several..... big obvious reasons. However, her Sisters in faith think she might be.... too blessed, they didn't get along well.
  
With the words of a new vampires threat going around, they voted to assign her to help with the Vigilants in their quest. Gwynesha is now staying as a guest in The White Hall - Dawnstar, helping the Vigilants of Stendarr in time of need, and offer her healing magic and soothing guidance to the residents who are having trouble with nightmares.
  
  
Gwynesha can hold her own in combat with destruction and alteration magic. She will heal the player and herself when needed with a generous mana pool.
  
She is rather tanky and won't be too aggressive during combat. 
  
  
Big thanks to [coldsun1187](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/9762372) for helping me with the custom healer spells and package!
  

[font=Verdana]**Version 2.0 Released!**[/font]
  
***Gwynesha will now heal fellow companions!***

Healer function information:
  
  

  
* She will heal the player, herself and fellow companions
She can reliably heal up to 2 extra companions, you can have more but they will take turn to get healed.
  
* I don't wanna make her blatantly OP broken so I made her heal single target, she will heal people one by one
Her heal has cast time, very small cooldown, and she requires-line of-sight to heal 
  
* She cannot heal some very few special custom companions that aren't managed by "currentfollowerfaction" since they use completely different system to manage themself. Companions which are normally managed by NFF or similar framework will work perfectly.
If the healing target is being blocked by enemies, she will try to circle around to heal them, this is intentional for immersion.
  

  
Some additional info:
  
  

  
* She is a Nord. She is essential and is marriageable
She has 100 weight.
  
* She has up to adept level of destruction and alteration magic.
She has powerful healing spells, for both the player and herself.
  
* She might not be able to heal the player if she is being attacked by too many enemies
Very big mana tanks ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
  
* She is at The White Hall - Dawnstar.
All screenshots were taken on BHUNP version.
  
* This mod is compatible with both BHUNP and 3BA version of the [Asset Hub](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80819)﻿.
Be extremely nice to her.
  

  
  
**Note: From version 2.0, Blessed Edition is removed and is replaced by Outfit Addon**
  
The outfit addon will require the main files, and [Queen Marika Dress](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/83261) | [BHUNP Conversion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/83597) and [Egil's Demon Hunter](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69374)
  
The reason why I made these a requirement is because she already use your body meshes, there is no point of having seperated meshes and bodyslide for her.
  
Beside, all these mods are ESL-flagged and if you enjoy their outfit design on her, go download and give the authors some love :)
  
Seperated Outfit Addon will also make it easier to update and maintain the main mod. It is also ESL-marked.
