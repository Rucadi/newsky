**I can't find him!**
  
He's near the pools in Eldergleam Sanctuary. However if he doesn't show up for any reason, use AddItemMenu (or a similiar mod) to give yourself a copy of his Summon Spell, this will move him to your location (Summon spell is called Summon Bragon - typo intentional).
  
**He won't speak when I meet him.**
  
Save and reload your game, thank Bethesda for pointless updates that break things.
  
**Does he fly?**
  
He does not. Please don't bring it up again, he's sensitive about it.
  
**He keeps aggroing enemies!**
  
Yeah, he's feisty. If he's alerting enemies to your presence, try asking him to use no magic or have him wait somewhere.
  
**Can I publish a patch for Baby Dragon?**
  
You sure can. I may do updates if something is broken but I have a lot on my plate so I encourage people to make and publish patches. Just link to the original.
  
**How do I import him in to a Follower Framework?**
  
This has only been tested with Nethers Follower Framework (which is what I recommend anyway). When you pick him up, select Custom Framework. You will then have a dialogue option 'Do you want to come with me, pup?' which will automatically import him into Nethers.
  
**Which is better, vanilla framework or Nethers?**
  
They both have pros and cons. I recommend the vanilla framework unless you need the pet spot for other pet followers that can only use it.
  
**Do I need BEES?**
  
If you are not on the latest Skyrim version, you will need BEES, this mod has a 1.71 header.
  
**ESL?**
  
Yah.
  
**Open perms???**
  
Double yah. If you want to use these assets to make your own - probably much better - baby dragon, go ahead. I have no interest in locking down perms like fort knox, my favorite mod authors have put assets up to be used by the community, I'm trying to follow their example. My only requests for this are to contact the mod authors listed below and confirm with them that they are okay with you using the Witcher Eye Textures and ENB light meshes. The other assets are my own or licensed under [Creative Commons - Attribution](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)﻿ so a link in the credits is all that is needed.
