First time modder here.
  
  
I made this mod because there was a modded quest mod called "There is no Umbra" that required 5 friends that could potentially be used for a ritual. Since I dislike the idea of killing off already existing NPC's, I decided to make them myself. 
  
  
This mod adds 5 followers in The Frozen Hearth whose sole purpose is to be used as sacrificial lambs. It is separated into two files; the main file and the optional file. The main file consist of only 4 followers since I forgot to combine the files. The optional file contains only the male orc so if you want to have 5 followers, you should install both files.
  
  
And again, this is a barebones follower mod so use this mod as it is.
