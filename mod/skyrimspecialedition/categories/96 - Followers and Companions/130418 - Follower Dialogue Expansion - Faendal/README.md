This mod is part of my series to renovate vanilla characters with additional depth, unique history or personality, and immersive and detailed interaction.
  
  
  
*"Bloody guards. I wanted them to be more competent, but not when we are the criminals!"*-During the quest "To Kill An Empire"
  
  
  
**How is Faendal envisioned and touched on in this mod:**
  
  
In this mod, Faendal is expanded as a **humorous, down-to-earth Bosmer huntsman** who longs for home after years apart from it, and finds it in the beauty of Skyrim. **A loyal yet sarcastic archer, Faendal sees things from a worldly angle.**
  
  
Faendal's story begins when his parents fled the Thalmor regime in Valenwood, seeking refuge in Cyrodiil. Growing up far from his homeland, **he became distant from his people's culture and traditions.** During his time in Cyrodiil, he met the love (crush) of his life Camilla Valerius. But because of Cyrodiil's crumbling economy and terrible security due to the Great War, he would leave for Skyrim to pursue a better life.
  
  
He met Camilla again in Skyrim, but this time he is faced by a fierce competition - a half-decent, brain-rotten (according to Faendal) bard who also sought the affection of the beautiful Imperial merchant.
  
  
**Will you help Faendal win her heart and earn the respect of this Bosmer archer, or will you take Camilla for yourself and make an eternal rival?**
  
  
In this mod, Faendal has a **sarcastic and practical demeanor.** He has many witty and sarcastic comments regarding the game's events, and provides a down-to-earth perspective on things.

**Features:**
  
1. Expands Faendal with 240 lines, all voiced by high quality AI (see the video for reference)
  
2. Quest awareness for the Thieves Guild, Dark Brotherhood, Companions questline, vanilla main quest and DLC main quest
  
3. New story-driven interactions
  
4. New dramatic lines if the player marries Camilla
  
5. Location-awareness, including cities and dungeons
  
6. Completely lore-friendly, expanding rather than completely rewriting the character
  
7. Immerse into your game world as a character who lives in it, rather than taking over the show
  
  
This mod is **100% compatible** with any mod. This mod does NOT come with the NPC appearance, only the new dialogues and content.
  
  
**Safe to add mid-save.**
  
  
There is a potential for **future expansion** with Faendal including **optional** synergy with the overarching Shezarrine Saga
