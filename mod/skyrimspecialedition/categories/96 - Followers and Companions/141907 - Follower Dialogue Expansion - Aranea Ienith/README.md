This mod is part of my series to renovate vanilla characters with additional depth, unique history or personality, and immersive and detailed interaction.
  
  
  
*"If we were free, then Azura would have already foreseen the choices we would make."*
  
  
  
**How is Aranea envisioned and touched on in this mod:**
  
  
In this mod, Aranea is expanded as a Lawful Neutral priestess of Azura who exists solely to serve her goddess's will. She believes that her life's purpose is defined by Azura's prophecies, and she would do anything - good or evil - to ensure their fulfillment.
  
  
Aranea once freed slaves from the Dunmeri Great Houses, but she has also stood by as cities burned, all because Azura foretold these events. **To her, concepts of good and evil are meaningless; her only commitment is to Azura's true path.**
  
  
Her story begins with a lineage of Azura worshipers who were persecuted during the Tribunal's reign. When the Tribunal's followers murdered her family, she longed for vengeance, but Azura's visions stayed her hand - for it was already prophesied that the Tribunal would fall, and Morrowind would suffer the flames of the Deadlands before being saved.
  
  
Aranea will join you after you complete the quest "The Black Star" by aiding Azura. She offers you undying loyalty, as her goddess has named you Azura's Chosen. However, **her loyalty is initially tied solely to your divine status.** As you develop your bond with her, you may **prove to her that you are a worthy soul to follow beyond your role as Azura's champion.**
  
  
In the mod, Aranea has a wise, sage-like demeanor and speaks as if she is an ancient being - as she has lived since the late Third Era, sustained by Azura's magic.
