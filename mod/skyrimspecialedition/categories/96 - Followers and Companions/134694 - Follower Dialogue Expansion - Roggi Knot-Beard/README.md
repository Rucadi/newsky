This mod is part of my series to renovate vanilla characters with additional depth, unique history or personality, and immersive and detailed interaction.
  
  
  
*"Some drink just to get drunk and forget about the world. A waste of good mead, if you ask me."*
  
  
  
**How is Roggi envisioned and touched on in this mod:**
  
  
In this mod, Roggi is expanded as a **cheerful, light-hearted Nord adventurer** with an unshakable love for mead and good company. He cares deeply about his friends and is always ready to share a tale or two over a drink. Whether you are swapping stories or raising a toast, Roggi makes for the **perfect drinking buddy.**Roggi is the **life of the party,** with an excitable, gregarious attitude that draws people to him. He thrives in the company of good friends and brave heroes who have interesting tales to share - but if you're short on stories, he'll happily get you drunk until you make something up!
  
  
His journey as a follower begins after you help him recover his family's shield, a treasured heirloom that holds great sentimental value.
  
  
In the mod, Roggi has a fun-loving demeanor. He has plenty of comments about mead and drinks, and **he'll even get especially mad at you for spoiling good mead during the Thieves Guild questline!**As a follower, Roggi may not be the most effective fighter - but more importantly than his combat prowess, it's his **infectious enthusiasm and unwavering loyalty** that will win you over!
  
  
*Trivia: I looked up how mead is made when I was writing for this mod.*

3. New **story-driven interactions**

5. Location-awareness and weather awareness
  
6. Completely **lore-friendly**, expanding rather than completely rewriting the character

There is a potential for **future expansion** with Roggi, including optional synergy with the overarching Shezarrine Saga
