[font=Arial]**[color=#8e7cc3]*DESCRIPTION:***
  
[/color][/font][left][font=Arial][/font][font=Lucida Sans Unicode][color=#efefef]**Onasha-Maki** is a custom big bodied Argonian follower mod that uses either [CBBE/3BA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30174)﻿ or [UNP/BHUNP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31126)﻿ meshes and textures, whose assets are provided by other mod authors. A highly recommended custom Bodyslide preset is provided as an optional file in either the FOMOD or standalone in the files section if you prefer. She just isn't the same without a big bodied preset, but of course that's the user's choice. She also comes with three different minor hair/horn options and four tail resize/reposition options.
  
  
Her preset is also now included in my [Big Beastly Bodies](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71547) ﻿preset pack, if you'd prefer to get it alongside my other presets for beast race follower mods.

[/font][/font]

  
* [font=Arial][font=Lucida Sans Unicode] Currently, **Onasha-Maki** comes in either 3BA or BHUNP which can be selected in the FOMOD.[/font][/font]
[font=Arial][font=Lucida Sans Unicode] Technically still works without installing any body type, but installing your preferred body type and it's dependencies is highly recommended so that everything works like it's supposed to.[/font][/font]
  
* [font=Arial][font=Lucida Sans Unicode]**If you want to customize her body size**, you'll need to download [BodySlide and Outfit Studio](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/201)﻿ in order to access and change her clothed and unclothed body. Her Bodyslide meshes are included for you to build. If you don't use Bodyslide to build her body she **WILL NOT** look like she does in the images.[/font][/font]
[font=Arial][font=Lucida Sans Unicode] Optional, but highly recommended, custom big bodied or muscular BodySlide presets included in the FOMOD and Optional Files. She's just not the same without it (or any big-bodied preset).[/font][/font]
  
* [font=Arial][font=Lucida Sans Unicode] Alternatively, you could also look into [OBody](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51084)﻿, [AutoBody](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61321)﻿, or [Proteus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62934)﻿ to help ease your life a bit when it comes to customizing and diversifying NPC bodies.[/font][/font]
[font=Arial][font=Lucida Sans Unicode]Optional CBBE / BHUNP Muscle Solution normal maps created by Graff and yaknafeinn respectively.[/font][/font]

[font=Arial]***SOFT REQUIREMENTS / RECOMMENDATIONS:***[/font]

  [/font]

[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]I highly recommend the following mods to use alongside mine:[/font]

[font=Arial]***INSTALLATION:***[/font]
  
  

[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]Nothing fancy, just use your preferred mod manager tool to install. Don't forget[/font][font=Lucida Sans Unicode] to build your bodies with BodySlide. DON'T INSTALL WITHOUT A MOD MANAGER, THERE'S[/font][font=Lucida Sans Unicode] A FOMOD INCLUDED. Some mod managers may have issues with the FOMOD since each manager installs FOMODs slightly differently. If you're experiencing issues, try to download the non-FOMOD versions in the Old Files section.[/font]

[font=Arial]***LORE:***[/font]
  
[/font]
  

*[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]You can find Onasha-Maki inside **Solitude's Hall of the Dead,** where shes been attempting to reanimate the minds and souls rather than just the bodies of those long gone. Although not a believer of Arkay, Onasha was granted permission to live and conduct her experiments in the Hall of the Dead while under supervision of Priest Styrr. While the morals of conducting such acts may be questionable, Onasha managed to convince the Jarl of Solitude to allow her conjurations. Persuaded by the benefits for achieving such an impossible feat, the Jarl found it impossible to reject Onasha's request. However, despite Onasha's ceaseless attempts to fully revive the dead, progress remained stagnant for months on end. All she had to show for her work were the mindless reanimated skeletons of past warriors roaming the catacombs below. Exhausted and frustrated, Onasha-Maki decided she needed to take some time away from the Hall to help clear her head. What she truly desired was an adventure. What she lacked however, was someone to help accompany her on this journey. That is.. until the Dragonborn walked through those doors.[/font]*
