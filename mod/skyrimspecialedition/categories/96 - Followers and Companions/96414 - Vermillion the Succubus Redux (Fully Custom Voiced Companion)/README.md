**Her Story so far**
  
  
Born in the ethereal realm of Moonshadow, Azura's Plane in Oblivion, she is a creature of mystique and allure. However, she is not your typical Succubus; she belongs to a rare and enigmatic lineage known as the Obsidian Succubi. Little is known about her early life, shrouded in mystery, but it is said that her existence has been marked by a sense of wanderlust from the very beginning.
  
  
In her arsenal, she wields the typical destructive spells favored by her kind, but she has also delved deep into the art of illusion, mastering its subtleties to manipulate the minds of those who dare to cross her path. Her most unique ability is a self-created teleportation spell, allowing her to traverse great distances in an instant, a skill that only adds to her air of unpredictability.
  
  
Her alignment is a chaotic neutrality; she is beholden to no moral code but her own, and her decisions are guided solely by her self-interest. The world is her playground, and she navigates it with a cunning and adaptable mindset.
  
  
Her primary goal is twofold: first, to find a soul mate who can match her intellect and spirit, someone who can quench her eternal thirst for adventure and knowledge. Second, she yearns to uncover the deepest secrets that the world, especially Skyrim, has to offer. It's a quest for power, intrigue, and the thrill of the unknown that propels her forward.
  
  
As she steps foot in the rugged and ancient land of Skyrim, she is a solitary figure, devoid of relationships or affiliations with any faction. Her arrival heralds a new chapter in her enigmatic existence, as she sets forth to carve her own destiny, weaving her allure, her powers, and her insatiable curiosity into the tapestry of this harsh and unforgiving world. The people of Skyrim would be wise to keep their wits about them, for the Obsidian Succubus has arrived, and her story has only just begun.
