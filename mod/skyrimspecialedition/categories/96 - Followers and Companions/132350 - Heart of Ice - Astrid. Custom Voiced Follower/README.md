I tried my best to make her story and character as much lore-friendly as possible, expanding vanilla lore at the same time. Inspired by lots of works of art. The character and the story was built from scratch as well as lore of her place of origin. That's a story about a  strong character with deep background.

Astrid Skadi Frea, daughter of Eivor of Haraldson clan is a 23-year old warrior from cold Roscrea island who spent virtually all her life training and fighting. At this moment she is believed to be the best and most fearful fighter on the island who has no match in melee. Ain't a surprise that such lifestyle could affect her character: she seems extremely arrogant and cold-hearted on sight. As her eye is covered with her hair so her heart is covered in a thick layer of armor making it unreachable for such feelings like love. 
  
  
This is what it looks like from the first glance...
  
  
Astrid came to Skyrim for a special mission: a unique artifact was stolen from her village and she is here to retrieve it at all costs. You meet in a quite stressful situation in Bluewater cave near Rorikstead. A dire set of circumstances puts her into a deadly situation, while you, as a protagonist become the one who saves her. As a show of good faith Astrid vows to fight by your side from now on until she pays back this debt of honour or dies. This is where you begin your new adventure together.
  
  
But getting her to know better you start recognizing her deep and suppressed character. Through talks and arguments, strolls, binges and even fights you start unveiling her true inner person, ultimately becoming Astrid's best friend or even a lover if your words are powerful and deeds are sincere enough to penetrate that thick armor and...
  
  
...melt her heart of ice.
  
  
***[size=4]The rest is for you to experience.***

**[font=Georgia]Chloë Elmore[/font]
  
[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]
  
[/font]**[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]Chloë Elmore is a New Zealand voice actress with fantastic voice and acting skills who gave her voice to Astrid. It was a big pleasure for me to work with her.
  
  
> It was one of the absolute joys of my career to be able to lend my voice to Astrid. Smashman has written such a beautiful, rich three-dimensional character. It is not often in a voice actor’s life that we get to know a character for 2,000+ lines of dialogue. I feel like Astrid is a part of me now. The transformation she goes through (which you players will get to enjoy from beginning to end) taught me a lot about myself. And I hope that all the players will hear my connection to Astrid and relate to her journey! You’re in for a treat!

[font=Georgia]**Installation**[/font]
  
[font=Arial]
  
[/font]There is a "noeinpatch" option in the installer. That's because the original creator of Einherjr Armor mod did not allow me to upload textures from the mod. So I made a special patch that allows you to use a vanilla leather outfit instead if you don't want to install the aforementioned mod.
  
  
**Do not add Astrid to any follower framework mod.**

[font=Georgia]**Open-Source**[/font]
  
[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]
  
I don't want to create patches for every incompatibility issue, so I decided to make this mod completely open-source. You can download all source scripts, make any changes and then upload them here as: compatibility patches, bugfixes, etc.
  
  
 ﻿You are also to create translations, replacers and other stuff without notifying me as long as this mod is required to install and this work is credited.[/font]
  
  
  
  
**[font=Georgia]- BHUNP? - Face Preset? - Bodyslides?[/font]**
  
  
[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]No. That's my fundamental position about this mod. I want to give you the version of Astrid that I have in my mind. However, I don't mind you uploading your own visions. Consider this as a "canonical" version.[/font]
