**Ashe and Serana Banter Update Release!
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/vY8pw7U.png)﻿**
  
Hey guys! Really happy to finally ship this update. Ashe 1.2 includes a big polish pass and a major romance expansion (new inserts + more romance-aware ambient dialogue), plus a ton of quest/flow and backend improvements.
  
Also - the thing I’m most excited about: Ashe × Serana banter is finally done, and it got so large it needed its own dedicated mod page. If you want the full duo experience (1,000+ lines across Dawnguard + Ashe’s questline, radiant travel banter, combat exchanges, and romance awareness), 
  
[[Grab it here!](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/167123)﻿]
  
  
If you enjoy the update, please endorse — it helps a ton with visibility and future improvements. ❤️[/size]

**What Does This Mod Do?**
  
**Ashe: Crystal Heart** is a Skyrim mod that introduces **Ashe**, a fully-voiced Breton\* follower with over **3,000 lines of rich, character-driven dialogue**. This mod offers a deeply personal and introspective journey, delving into themes of identity, purpose, and morality - bringing a depth unseen in Skyrim.
  
  
  
**DLC-Sized Questline**
  
Embark on a **DLC-sized quest** spanning all of Skyrim, offering hours of new content - **half the scope of Dawnguard**. Uncover the secrets of Ashe's creation and assist her unique quest. Your choices shape her evolving ethical compass, leading to multiple outcomes. When vengeance is achieved, Ashe must face her past and forge a new purpose in a world that struggles to understand her.
  
  
**Dynamic Super Follower**
  
Ashe is a dynamic companion whose relationship with you evolves based on your choices. Unlock extensive features gradually, including:
  

  
* **Training and Sparring**: Improve your skills together.
**Custom Outfit System**: Outfits change automatically based on location.
  
* **Blacksmithing Services**: She can forge and improve your weapons.
**Backpack Storage**: Extra carrying capacity.
  
* **Immersive Commentary**: Reacts to your skills, actions, and locations.
**Radiant Features**: Includes sleep, teleportation, and tracking markers.
  

**Evolving Relationships**
  
Develop **friendship and romance** organically. Ashe doesn't just throw herself at you; your actions genuinely influence the relationship dynamics, not just scripted events. The friendship and romance systems are nuanced, moving beyond simple binary choices.
  
**Advanced Technical Enhancements**
  

  
* **Custom Animations**: Exclusive to this mod, enhancing her unique personality.
**Next-Gen Visuals**: HD textures, unique texture sets per character, and HDT physics support for hair and outfits.
  
* **Compatibility**: Built-in support for **Open Animation Framework**, **OStim Standalone**, and **Expressive Facial Animations** for lifelike animations.
**Optional Integration with Attack - MCO (Modern Combat Overhaul):** If MCO is installed, Ashe features unique, custom movesets tailored to her combat style. 
  
* **Bodyslide-Ready Outfit**: Supports all popular body types.

  
**Original Design and Lore Integration**
  
Ashe features an original character design that blends the **stylized aesthetics often found in JRPGs with Skyrim's more grounded fantasy world**. This fusion of styles is intentional, aiming to create a visually unique and memorable character. The mod also takes great care to expand upon Skyrim's existing lore, ensuring Ashe's presence feels believable and integrated. You'll find NPCs in key locations like Solitude, Whiterun, and Riverwood who acknowledge and interact with her, and discover hand-crafted locations designed with environmental storytelling in mind that help to explain her unique nature.
  
  
  

(Cinematic Release Trailer, followed by a Gameplay Preview by PonPon.)

  
**Renowned Voice Cast**
  
Experience unparalleled depth with an **ensemble cast of renowned voice actors**, including:
  

  
* **Anna Rust** (*Carnival Row*, *Cyberpunk 2077*) as Ashe.
**Sean Chiplock** (*Genshin Impact*, *Re:Zero*) among others.
  

**Limitless Potential**
  
With future content updates planned - companion banter with Serana, quest awareness, and additional questline material.
  
  
  
\*She's not Breton in the conventional sense. Without getting into spoilers, play the mod to find out!

**Ashe's Design Philosophy**
  
I drew inspiration from a mix of stylized games and fantasy anime - think *NieR: Automata*, *Baldur’s Gate 3*, *The Witcher 3*, *Berserk*, and *Claymore*. I worked hard to keep Ashe grounded in Skyrim’s lore, giving her unique abilities and a backstory that justifies her look.
  
**Think of her this way:** *if Clare and Guts had a daughter, she grew up sparring with BG3’s Shadowheart, got fashion pointers from 2B, then found herself in Skyrim grappling with existential angst - yet still manages to be effortlessly cool and undeniably attractive.*
  
I’ve listened to feedback on her outfit too - check out my “[Design Details](https://sites.google.com/view/martimiusmods/ashe-fire-and-blood/about-ashe-design-and-development?authuser=0#h.thg12abco4v0)” article for the full story.
  
  
  
**How Did This Mod Come To Be?**
  
After creating Serana Dialogue Add-On, I wanted a fresh challenge: an original character with her own quests and personality. Ashe represents everything I’ve learned so far as a modder, from writing to voice acting and quest design.
  
  
  
  
**Feedback and Continuous Improvement**
  
I’m always refining Ashe based on community feedback. If you have ideas or spot issues, let me know here or on my Discord! I truly value user input and want to make Ashe one of Skyrim’s standout companions.

Compatibility/Awareness Patches (Available on Patch Hub - Coming Soon!)
  
  
  
[size=3]**Mod Requirements**This mod works right out of the box with no hard requirements. However, my mod integrates with others pretty well, so please read below to see what they are!
  
  
Mod Integrations (Optional)

  
* **Nemesis and DAR/OAR:** For custom animations. Without the mod, you won't be able to see some unique flavor/dialogue/combat animations.
**HDT-SMP:** For outfit and HDT hair physics support. Without the mod, Ashe's hair will still work, it'll just be static.
  
* **SKSE:** For additional functionality (mainly for backend mod checks).
**EFA (Expressive Facial Animations):** Improves facial animations. Non-EFA setups are also supported.
  
* **RSkyrim Children Overhaul:** For a "non-potato head" patch for Remy. Without it, Remy will look like any other Skyrim child.
**OStim Standalone:** Enables animated romance scenes. Without this, romances will fade to black.
  
* **MCO (Modern Combat Overhaul) + SCAR:** If installed, Ashe has unique combat movesets designed specifically for her, adding dynamic and immersive gameplay. Without this, her combat reverts to basic Skyrim animations but will still use replacers for the default Skyrim animations.

  
Mod Integrations (Outfits):
  

  
* **[Milk Drinker Yorha 2B Attire](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48359)﻿ -** No patch needed, Ashe comments when she's given 2B's main armor.
[/size][left][/left]
  
**Compatibility**
  
Ashe was designed with compatibility in mind, but some conflicts may arise due to Skyrim's extensive modding ecosystem.
  
  
**Known Compatibility Issues:**
  
Location conflicts (e.g., Aryo's Workshop, Riverwood Commune).
  
Specific mod issues (e.g., Improved Alternate Conversation Camera, VR).
  
MFG Fix NG: With MFG Fix NG installed, some players may notice Ashe’s eyes remain closed briefly after a few lines. This minor visual quirk resolves on its own once you exit dialogue or pick another topic. It does not affect gameplay or progression.
  
Movesets & Precision: Ashe’s **Shrine of Vedir moveset** can cause attacks to miss due to the animations’ removed hit multipliers. This is not a bug with Ashe herself.
  

  
* With **Precision**, NPCs may whiff attacks because they aren’t aware of the altered hitboxes.
    
  [list]
Fix: disable Precision’s weapon hitbox feature, or add an override in "SKSE\plugins\precision\AshePrecision.toml" (NOTE, this will have to be done for each weapon you have her wield without affecting other NPCs)
  

```
[[WeaponOverride]]Weapon = { FormID = 0x4761B, Plugin = "Ashe - Fire and Blood.esp" }Length = 150Radius = 20
```


[\*]Alternatively, replace her moveset with a different MCO animation pack.
  
[/list]
  
  
Workarounds and Details:
  
[Visit this page on my website for the full compatibility list, known conflicts, and solutions.](https://sites.google.com/view/martimiusmods/ashe-fire-and-blood?authuser=0#h.fl822vijv4)
  
**Official Compatibility / Optional Files (hosted on this page)****Ashe × Inigo Patch** – Fixes a single world-encounter commentary record so both followers can comment without conflict. ESL-flagged; load after both mods.
  
**Ashe UCOW / ICOW Book-Placement Patch** – Moves Ashe’s Arcanaeum books to the relocated table used by **Ultimate College of Winterhold** and **Immersive College of Winterhold**. No hard master required. Credits to ReDrew89.
  
**Ashe Vanilla Body Patch (Experimental)** – Forces Ashe and related NPCs to use the game’s vanilla body, leaving custom outfits untouched. May cause minor texture stretching; planned to merge once thoroughly tested.
  
**Legacy Skirt Bodyslide Files (v1.0 LegacySkirt)**Bring back Ashe’s shorter 1.0 skirt with updated boot fixes. Choose the set that matches your body mod, overwrite the main FOMOD, then rebuild in Bodyslide: • 3BA • BHUNP • CBBE

  

  
﻿**Unofficial Compatibility Patches**
  
Here are some fan-made patches and integrations created by users for other mods. These are unofficial and not officially supported. For any technical issues related to these patches, please contact the respective patch authors, not me.
  
SL and Flowergirls Patch: Provides integration for SexLab and Flowergirls. ([Link﻿](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/135992?tab=description))
  
SkyChild Patch: Provides compatibility and look support for the Skychild mod with this mod's Remy NPC. Use this instead of the RS Children Patch if you have SkyChild in your modding setup. ([Link﻿](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/136098))
  
Ulvenwald Patch: Fixes a conflict between Ashe and Ulvenwald, where a tree from Ulvenwald was blocking a path in Riverwood Commune, causing NPCs and the player to get stuck. ([Link](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/140446/))
  
Northern Roads Patch: Fixes compatibility issues with the Northern Roads mod ([Link](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77386?tab=description))
  
Paradise Valley Compatibility Patch: Fixes blocking Aryo's Lab ([Link](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/150663))
  
Nevas Hostility Fix: Not technically a (patch) but the issue tends to arise on heavily modded setups. Use this if a specific scene in Chapter 2 isn't firing correctly. ([Link](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/152992?tab=description))
  
Ashe LoreRim Community Patch: Community patch for LoreRim & Requiem that rebalances gameplay and begins adding lore-friendly adjustments to Ashe’s dialogue, outfits, and features (work in progress). ([Link](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/141770?tab=description))
  
  
  
Note: If you encounter other compatibility issues, please report them with a detailed description and your load order.
  
**Quick Installation Instructions (PC)**

  
1. *(Optional)* Install the soft requirements.
Download and install the FOMOD, and the latest hotfix (if applicable).
  
2. Run through the installer options.
Place Ashe **near the bottom of your load order.** This ensures her mod wins conflicts, which is critical for her questline to function correctly.
  
3. **Bodyslide Setup:**
     
   * If you chose a custom outfit, build meshes in Bodyslide.
   You can select between heels or non-heels for Ashe’s boots.
     
   * While the mod functions without Bodyslide, skipping this step may result in minor seams, clipping, or mismatched body meshes.
Run **Nemesis** to enable her unique animations.
  
4. Launch the game and enjoy!

**Important Notes:**
  

  
* **Prologue Saves:** Use at your own risk! To upgrade from the Prologue mod, dismiss/disable Ashe, travel to a new cell, uninstall the old version, and then install the new version.
**Closed Beta Saves:** Generally safe to update, though some fixes may not retroactively apply based on quest progress. Refer to the changelog for details.
  

  
**Dialogue Voices:**
  
The impressionist voices were carefully crafted with attention to quality and consistency, ensuring an immersive experience. If they are not to your liking, a patch is available to disable them; however, I encourage you to try them out first. For unofficial AI voice patches, permissions are open—please contact me directly to discuss.
  
  
**Bug Reports:**
  
Ashe: Crystal Heart is my most ambitious mod, and while extensively tested, unique issues may still arise due to diverse setups. Bug reports are welcome, but please:
  

  
1. Ensure correct installation and load order.
Test and document the issue thoroughly.
  
2. (Optional) Check for conflicts in xEdit and share findings.

For detailed steps, see the **pinned post** in the comments section. Thank you for helping improve the mod! ?
  
  
  
**Permissions and Redistribution:**
  
  
Translation Permissions:
  
Permissions for translations are fully open! Feel free to create and share translations of the mod to help it reach a wider audience. Let’s work together to make Ashe accessible to as many players as possible! ?
  
  
Mod Pack/Collection Permissions:
  
For collection curators and compilers, permissions are generally open. However, please contact me before including my mod in your collection. Also, ensure compatibility between my mod and the rest of the mods in your pack to provide the best experience for users.
  
  
Replacer Permissions:
  
Replacer permissions are open as well! If you'd like to create a replacer for Ashe, feel free to do so - just contact me once it’s done so I can help advertise your work!

Quick Playthrough Hints:
  

  
* Play the game, I'll hold your hand (just a bit) hahaha.
If you can't find them, she's hanging out at the Winking Skeever in Solitude.
  
* You'll need 200 gold to recruit her.

  
  
**FAQ:**Where to Find Ashe & How to Start Her Quest
  

  
* Check “Quick Playthrough Hints” for her location. Once she’s recruited, talk to her and let the story unfold naturally.

Outfit & Appearance
  

  
* Ashe has a built-in outfit management system for customization. A fully original outfit is also in the works.

Technical & Compatibility Notes
  

  
* Horse-riding is planned but not yet implemented.
If you encounter bugs or missing hair, see the pinned troubleshooting steps.
  
* VR players may experience black screens during dream sequences; use “Enter” or “Trigger” to advance.

Romance & Writing Style
  

  
* Two ways to begin her romance (progress her story or use a shortcut).
Expect a darker, more mature character exploration—similar in depth to SDA but with sharper, original writing.
  

Additional Topics
  

  
* No official support for modded/modified versions of Ashe.
Ashe’s design is “lore-adjacent,” pushing creative boundaries for a unique follower experience.
  
* AI-voiced patches require permission and must respect voice actors’ wishes.

**AI Clarification (Transparency):**
  
I occasionally use AI tools (e.g., large language models such as ChatGPT) for **process support outside the game build --**for example, style/grammar checks, outlining options, patch-note and announcement drafting, documentation clarity, and other workflow efficiencies. **All creative ideas, storylines, character concepts, and plot beats originate from the Mod Author. All in-game wording is authored and edited by a human before release.** No AI-generated art or AI-generated voices are included in the released Mod. *(For any use of this mod’s assets in AI training datasets -- including voice recordings -- see Restriction #1.)*
