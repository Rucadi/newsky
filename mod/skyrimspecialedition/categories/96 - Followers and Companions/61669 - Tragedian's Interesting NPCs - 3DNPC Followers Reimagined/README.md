# Tragedian's Interesting NPCs - 3DNPC Followers Reimagined
- Author: Tragedian
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61669


Interesting NPCs is an amazing endeavor, boasting a plethora of characters with unique personalities & varied looks. This mod is my attempt to update the appearance of several characters using higher quality assets whilst making an effort to avoid straying too far from their original features so as to keep them recognizable. I'll continue to add more NPCs in subsequent updates until I've covered every follower & possibly some other key characters.
  
  
Certain NPCs have also been given new perks & improved AI to enhance their combat performance, though they'll be far from overpowered. If anything, I consider it a much-needed boost, especially for those of us that play with difficulty-enhancing mods. To see a more in-depth list of changes for each follower, click the spoiler tags below.
  

**A  >>>  J**

  

Spoiler
  
[size=2]Perks in **WHITE** were already assigned by the original mod, while those in **YELLOW** were added by me.
  
[/size][left]
  
**-- ALASSEA --
  
  
Perks:** Light Foot, Apprentice Destruction, Recovery (Tier 1), Regeneration, Mage Armor (Tier 1), Magic Resistance (Tier 1)
  
  
*NOTES: In addition to her bardic prowess, Alassea is also a talented mage. I've given her the appropriate perks to help round out her kit.*
  
  
  
**-- AMALEE --**
  
**Perks:** Light Foot, Overdraw (Tier 1), Critical Shot (Tier 1), Ranger, Quickshot
  
  
*NOTES: As a ranger, Amalee prefers to avoid melee combat & fight at a distance whenever possible. With bow in-hand, she'll shoot down any foe who dares get close enough to try & mar her beauty.*
  
  
  
**-- AMONG-THE-HIST --**
  
**Perks:** Light Foot, Augmented Flames (Tier 1), Augmented Shock (Tier 1), Adept Destruction, Recovery (Tier 1), Mage Armor (Tier 1)
  
  
*NOTES: I’ve given Among-The-Hist the standard set of mage perks to improve his damage & survivability.*
  
  
  
**-- ANUM-LA THE SWAMP KNIGHT --**
  
**Perks:** Light Foot, Armsman (Tier 1), Shield Wall (Tier 2), Block Runner, Deflect Arrows
  
  
*NOTES: Anum-La is an experienced fighter & sought-after mercenary whose skills are an asset to any adventuring party. I've given her a few perks to improve her defense & allow her to fulfill the role of a proper tank.***-- ARGHUS --**
  
**Perks:** Light Foot, Conjuration Dual Casting, Adept Conjuration, Destruction Dual Casting, Augmented Frost, Regeneration, Mage Armor (Tier 1)
  
  
*NOTES: The former scryer’s earned a subtle makeover, but otherwise needs no extra buffs. He’s already well-poised to wreak arcane havoc on your enemies.*
  
  
  
**-- BRAKH --**
  
**Perks:** Light Foot, Overdraw (Tier 1), Critical Shot (Tier 1), Ranger, Quickshot
  
  
*NOTES: The Orcish hunter will now be able to pepper the battlefield with arrows at a quicker rate & with greater force.*
  
  
  
**-- CALLEN --**
  
**Perks:** Light Foot, Armsman (Tier 1), Fighting Stance, Bladesman (Tier 1), Shield Wall (Tier 1)
  
  
*NOTES: I've given Callen a minor boost to her damage & defense. Now she'll deal respectable damage even with her trusty rusted blade.*
  
  
  
**-- DAENLYN OAKHOLLOW --**
  
**Perks:** Light Foot, Recovery (Tier 1), Regeneration, Overdraw (Tier 2), Ranger, Agile Defender (Tier 2)
  
  
*NOTES: Daenlyn is rather unique in terms of his fighting style. He prefers a bow, but also has access to a few low-level spells. I’ve given him a slight boost to his magical abilities & tried to round out his overall kit.*
  
  
  
**-- DAGRI'LON --**
  
**Perks:** Light Foot, Atromancy, Expert Destruction, Recovery (Tier 2), Mage Armor (Tier 1), Magic Resistance (Tier 1)
  
  
*NOTES: Even with no face to improve upon, Dagri'Lon still deserves a little something, don't you think? After all, his true powers are supposedly incomprehensible. I've given him several perks to bring his abilities in-line with the other magical followers.*
  
  
  
**-- DURAZ --**
  
**Perks:** Light Foot, Armsman (Tier 1), Savage Strike, Block Runner, Juggernaut (Tier 2)
  
  
*NOTES: Duraz isn't your typical sellsword & can't be bought for a mere handful of gold. As such, I felt a buff was warranted.*
  
  
  
**-- EREVAN --**
  
**Perks:** Light Foot, Armsman (Tier 1), Fighting Stance, Well Fitted, Reflect Blows
  
  
*NOTES: As a former Knight of Thorns, I figured Erevan should be able to turn a bit of the damage he takes back onto his enemies.*
  
  
  
**-- FA’NAR --**
  
**Perks:** Light Foot, Barbarian (Tier 1), Champions Stance, Skullcrusher (Tier 1), Juggernaut (Tier 2)
  
  
*NOTES: [i]I've given Fa'nar a few enhancements to reflect his past as a trained soldier & affinity for war hammers*.[/i]
  
  
  
**-- FONTAINE --**
  
**Perks:** Light Foot, Conjuration Dual Casting, Adept Conjuration, Destruction Dual Casting, Augmented Frost (Tier 1), Augmented Flames (Tier 1), Recovery (Tier 1), Regeneration
  
  
*NOTES: Fontaine's gained a few enhancements to round out his spellcasting abilities.*
  
  
  
**-- FROA --**
  
**Perks:** Light Foot, Muffled Movement, Barbarian (Tier 4), Agile Defender (Tier 2)
  
  
*NOTES: Since she's already capable of dishing out considerable damage on her own, I've only given Froa a small boost to her defense to compensate for her disdain of footwear.*
  
  
  
**-- GORR --**
  
**Perks:** Light Foot, Champions Stance, Deep Wounds (Tier 1), Limbsplitter (Tier 1), Skullcrusher (Tier 1), Tower of Strength
  
  
*NOTES: Gorr is a skilled warrior & master of deadly weaponry. The new perks should allow him to perform effectively with whatever gear you decide to give him.*
  
  
  
**-- HELSIG --**
  
**Perks:** Light Foot, Destruction Dual Casting, Augmented Shock (Tier 2), Recovery (Tier 2), Regeneration, Mage Armor (Tier 1), Magic Resistance (Tier 1)
  
  
*NOTES: Helsig already has a vast amount of spells [i]& several perks* at her disposal. As such, I've only modified *her appearance*.[/i]
  
  
  
**-- HJOROMIR --**
  
**Perks:** Light Foot, Armsman (Tier 1), Fighting Stance, Agile Defender (Tier 1)
  
**Level Cap:** Raised from 3 to 20
  
  
*NOTES: Hjoromir is a farmer with aspirations of becoming an adventurer, though he's got quite a ways to go. I understand the original intention was that keeping him alive is meant to be a challenge, but with a static level of 3, he’s essentially made of tissue. I’ve increased his level cap slightly & he’ll level at a rate equaling half of yours, reflecting his inexperience.*
  
  
  
**-- JADE --**
  
**Perks:** Stealth (Tier 2), Light Foot, Backstab, Muffled Movement, Agile Defender (Tier 1)
  
  
*NOTES: The thief-turned-priestess does her best to avoid conflict & is more likely to cower in fear at the sight of a bandit party than brandish her dagger & fight alongside you. Even so, I've given her a few perks in line with her skillset.*
  
  
  
**-- JILKMAR --**
  
**Perks:** Light Foot, Armsman (Tier 1), Fighting Stance, Agile Defender (Tier 1)
  
  
*NOTES: A self-professed milk-drinker, Jilkmar isn't going to be cutting down swaths of draugr & wild beasts anytime soon. As such, I've only given him a minor boost to his damage & defense.*[/left][size=3]

**L  >>>  V**

  

Spoiler
  
[size=2]Perks in **WHITE** were already assigned by the original mod, while those in **YELLOW** were added by me.
  
[/size][left]
  
**-- LAJJAN --**
  
**Perks:** Light Foot, Armsman (Tier 1), Savage Strike, Block Runner, Juggernaut (Tier 2)
  
  
*NOTES: I’ve given Lajjan a handful of buffs to compliment her role as a caravan guard so that her charges need not fear as they travel across the wilds of Skyrim.*
  
  
  
**-- LARKSPUR --**
  
**Perks:** Light Foot, Novice Illusion, Apprentice Illusion, Overdraw (Tier 1), Critical Shot (Tier 1), Ranger
  
  
*NOTES: The Bosmer illusionist gains a small boost to the efficiency of his spells as well as his bow-arm.*
  
  
  
**-- LURGOK --**
  
**Perks:** Light Foot, Apprentice Destruction, Adept Destruction, Recovery (Tier 1), Hack and Slash (Tier 1), Savage Strike
  
  
*NOTES: Lurgok is a powerful combatant gifted in spellcraft & talented with an axe. The new perks should help him cleave a path through your enemies with either of his chosen tools.  I've also given him some war paint that's evocative of his patron deity, Malacath*
  
  
  
**-- MERESINE --**
  
**Perks:** Light Foot, Power Shot, Critical Shot (Tier 1), Ranger, Custom Fit
  
  
*NOTES: Meresine already comes equipped with several useful perks & a powerful set of equipment. As such, a visual change is all I've given her.*
  
  
  
**-- MORNDAS --**
  
**Perks:** Stealth (Tier 4), Muffled Movement, Light Foot, Assassin's Blade, Silent Roll, Silence, Light Fingers (Tier 4), Keymaster
  
  
*NOTES: As a master pickpocket, Morndas isn't best known for her willingness to engage in physical altercations, but rather her ability to avoid them. I've only given her a visual upgrade for now.*
  
  
**-- QA'DOJO --**
  
**Perks:** Light Foot, Augmented Shock, Recovery (Tier 2), Regeneration, Respite, Mage Armor (Tier 1), Magic Resistance (Tier 1)
  
  
*NOTES: The elderly Khajiit monk was already a powerful sorcerer to begin with. His mane just needed a bit of grooming.*
  
  
**-- RAYNES --**
  
**Perks:** Light Foot, Muffled Movement, Armsman (Tier 1), Fighting Stance, Dual Flurry (Tier 1), Agile Defender (Tier 2)
  
  
*NOTES: I've given Raynes a few perks to reflect his affinity for small blades & enhance his combat capabilities.*
  
  
  
**-- RUMARIN --**
  
  
**Perks:** Light Foot, Conjuration Dual Casting, Novice Conjuration, Apprentice Conjuration, Mystic Binding, Dual Flurry
  
  
*NOTES: Contrary to his charming nature, Rumarin is quite the force to be reckoned with in the thick of battle. As such, a visual change is all that's warranted.*
  
  
**-- SKJARN --**
  
**Perks:** Light Foot, Barbarian (Tier 1), Champions Stance, Limbsplitter (Tier 1), Agile Defender (Tier 2)
  
  
*NOTES: This arrogant bard loves to boast about his prowess, be it onstage or in the bedroom. The new perks will ensure he's a greater source of pain to your enemies than he is in your side.*
  
  
  
**-- SKJEL THE GRAY --**
  
**Perks:** Light Foot, Novice Destruction, Apprentice Destruction, Augmented Frost (Tier 1), Recovery (Tier 1)
  
  
*NOTES: I may not be able to give Skjel a makeover, but hopefully a boost to his spellcasting abilities should suffice.*
  
  
  
**-- TIKRID --**
  
**Perks:** Light Foot, Armsman (Tier 1), Fighting Stance, Bladesman (Tier 1), Juggernaut (Tier 1)
  
  
*NOTES: Tikrid's new perks offer a modest boost to her damage & defense. She's supposedly an awkward fighter so I didn't want to make her overly strong.*
  
  
  
**-- VALGUS --**
  
  
**Perks:** Light Foot, Restoration Dual Casting, Recovery (Tier 1), Regeneration, Expert Restoration, Mage Armor (Tier 1)
  
  
*NOTES: A talented healer, Valgus uses magic to mend the wounded. I've given him a slight boost to his magicka regeneration that should help him out in longer fights, but otherwise he's already quite self-sufficient.*
  
  
  
**-- VARDATH --**
  
**Perks:** Light Foot, Overdraw (Tier 1), Ranger, Quickshot, Agile Defender (Tier 2)
  
  
*NOTES: Vardath may be outwardly charming, but he's still a slaver so I wanted him to look a little sleazy. The new perks offer a minor boost to his damage output.*
  
  
  
**-- VAUGHN --**
  
**Perks:** Light Foot, Armsman (Tier 1), Savage Strike, Block Runner, Juggernaut (Tier 2)
  
  
*NOTES: Vaughn charges twice as much as other mercenaries in Skyrim, but he didn't really measure up to how much he valued his own sword arm.*
  
  
  
**-- VAWKES --**
  
**Perks:** Stealth (Tier 2), Light Foot, Dual Flurry (Tier 1), Dual Savagery
  
  
*NOTES: As befits a grave-robbing scavenger, Vawkes should have an easier time sneaking around now & can defend himself a bit better if caught.*
  
  
  
**-- YLGYNE --**
  
**Perks:** Light Foot, Armsman (Tier 1),Fighting Stance, Bone Breaker (Tier 1), Juggernaut (Tier 2)
  
  
*NOTES: Ylgyne describes himself as a "blunt instrument" & has an affinity for maces. I've given him a little boost in that regard & cleaned up his appearance a bit.*
  
  
  
**-- ZORA FAIR-CHILD --**
  
**Perks:** Light Foot, Barbarian (Tier 1), Champion's Stance, Deep Wounds (Tier 1), Agile Defender (Tier 2)
  
  
*NOTES: Zora's no slouch when it comes time to brandish her massive sword. She's deceptively strong & never one to back down from a fight. The new perks will help improve her overall damage & defense.*[/left]

  
**REQUIREMENTS & RECOMMENDATIONS**
  
  
Obviously, [Interesting NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194)﻿ is a hard requirement for this mod. However, facegen was generated using [Expressive Facegen Morphs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35785) so Expressive Facial Animations ([Male](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19532)﻿ & [Female](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19181)﻿) could be considered a soft requirement to ensure there's no incidental clipping. If you'd like your followers to look exactly like the screenshots, I highly recommend Tempered Skins ([Male](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7902) & [Female](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8505)), [Mild Complexions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28510)﻿, [Brows](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1062)﻿, [Beards](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1067), & [True Faces](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34636). Finally, [Nordic Faces](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40658) has a miscellaneous file that includes updated meshes for every Interesting NPC & compliments this overhaul quite nicely. Just ensure that my mod overwrites its loose files to prevent any issues with gray/dark face.
