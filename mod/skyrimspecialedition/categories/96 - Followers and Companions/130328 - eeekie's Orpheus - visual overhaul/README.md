A new custom voiced follower from Craftian? And a meanie to boot? Hell yeah, sign me up. THIS IS ONLY AN APPEARANCE REPLACER.
  
  
As per his personality description, I did not want to pretty this guy up. He's an ANCIENT. SNOW ELF. VAMPIRE. It really doesn't get a lot more sus than that. Hopefully you like what I've done with him. 
  
  
[font=Verdana]Important Info:[/font]
  
  
He is COTR based, as such is a custom race. However, his head textures have a custom BnP base with custom ALT1 details, and thus he should be **compatible with (and only with!) BNP skin**. Regarding RSV SPID: COTR BnP is only compatible with base BnP skins -  you get neck seams if it distributes fantasy skins, so read up on how to exclude him from a fantasy distribution. Because he is COTR he may not play nice with EasyNPC. Just overwrite whatever NPC merge you have with him- he is ESL flagged.
  
  
His weight has been changed to 25 from 50 which means that you either need to start her on a new game, or use the console command to change his weight midgame. Click on him in the console, type "setnpcweight 50", enter, then "disable", enter, then "enable". Or you can use Save Unbaker.
