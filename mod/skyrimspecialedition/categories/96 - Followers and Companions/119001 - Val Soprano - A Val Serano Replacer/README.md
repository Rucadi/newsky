I recently noticed that I was missing out on some follower mods [/font][font=Trebuchet MS]*(based on what my other friend was making replacers of)*[/font][font=Trebuchet MS] - in which I then found out about [**Val Serano**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/103669). There was no way I wouldn't try to[/font][font=Trebuchet MS] make a *[completely-not-inspired-by-another-character-in-another-game-universe](https://historica.fandom.com/wiki/Edward_Kenway)*. (ㅅ´ ˘ `)
  
  
This started out mostly as a 'unique skin texture paths' project for me - as I wanted to try that out for once for some upcoming replacers in the future + I've never tried to make something from reference, so here we are.

[/font] Important info!
  
  
❗For users who came to download the updated version of the original Val mod (2.0+ version).
  
[/size]

  
* *You need to download the 1.1 version of Val Soprano - A Val Serano replacer. Older versions are not compatible with the 2.0 update.* 
    
  *I've replaced the 'alternate' folder with the skin used as well, in case you would want to try out the HIMBO / TNG body of Val
    
  + (Tho.. I highly recommend the new visual replacer that comes with the original mod, it's very gorgeous!).*
*I followed whatever was in the mod already for the skin folders, which led to the removal of SOS folders.* 
  
*Is Val ONLY Nevernude? ~~No, he isn't -- I have never replaced his body meshes~~ I'm such a stupid idiot I confused myself all this time - I never replaced any body meshes; aside from whatever is already in the original mod. Only skin textures have been replaced. The worst case is that you get mismatching pp texture if you have the TNG version but idk how tht works so la la. 
  
I don't use body replacers for males, so I have limited knowledge + no motivation to help with this.** *[font=Trebuchet MS][size=3][size=3][font=Trebuchet MS][size=3][size=2][i]The skin has been edited by [SerketHetyt](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/serkethetyt/about-me?gameId=1704)﻿ to alleviate the neck-seam nitpick I had lmao -- please check out her work! ~~I've enslaved her~~ she has been so kind to be willing to take screenies for me just to update some of the mod pages [font=Trebuchet MS][size=3][size=3]❤️*[/size][/font][/size][/size][/font][/size][/size][/font][/i][/size]
    
  *[font=Trebuchet MS][i][font=Trebuchet MS]
    
  + The cuirass replacer has been updated as well, however it can be used for both 1.05+ and 2.0 versions. I attempted to alleviate some clippings + added a HIMBO refit option. This is my first time doing a HIMBO refit, so do let me know if something is iffy.[/font]*[/font][/i]

 **??﹏⊹ ࣪ ˖** **V A L  S O P R A N O** is a custom-voiced follower replacer *(+optional cuirass replacer!)* for the hella cool mod '[Val Serano - Pirate Custom Voiced Follower and Quest Adventure](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/103669)' by [Axarien](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/72078788) - voiced by [Krimson Graey](https://linktr.ee/Krimson_Graey). The replacer maintains his tattoos with a new skin - **[BnP Male skin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65402) by Frida and Enroy** (+ by many of the people in the file credits), together with a **slightly edited [hair](https://www.patreon.com/posts/public-mens-hair-100889687) mesh from Lilyrim** (check out their [patreon too](https://www.patreon.com/user?u=11199437)!).
  
  

*'But hey, why is it called 'Val Soprano-?'*

  
[/font]

[font=Trebuchet MS]I recently also watched **the Sopranos** for the past weeks while ~~*simmering in my depression over work*~~ I was making this. I stuck with the name, cause I already made the plugin while on insomnia-induced sleep deprivation whoops.
  
[/font]

[font=Trebuchet MS]
  
[/font]

[font=Trebuchet MS]*It can be a bit confusing* if you've never heard of the mod - but the name is

[size=3][size=3][size=2]If this isn't your vision of Val Serano, that's okay! I created him based off of my own modlist, and we all have our own style of NPCs for our modlists.
  
There are many other very good replacers out there for him that might fit your taste![/size][/size][/size][/font][font=Trebuchet MS]

**Hard Requirements: 
  
- [Val Serano - Pirate Custom Voiced Follower and Quest Adventure](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/103669)
  
  
Soft Requirements**:
  
- [Val Serano Wanted Poster Replacers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/117210) (**Optional**, *but highly recommended* to match up with the new face! Thanks to [PercythePersimmon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/190719915)!)
  
  
The actual replacer doesn't have **a FOMOD installer** this time - as this is basically just a **plug 'n play type of replacer!**
  
[/font][font=Trebuchet MS]⚔ *His skin and FaceTint are **2k textures** - I unfortunately optimized everything and* ***lost the 4K one****.**..* ***﻿in the future, I might come back to it - and upload a 4K version!***
  
  
⚔ *The skin will **retain his original tattoos** - with [BnP Male skin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65402) (older version).
  
 ﻿Thanks to [Fridam](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/swefrida/mods) and [Enroys](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Enroys/about-me) (+the team) for permission usage, please check them out!*
  
  
⚔ *He uses a slightly* ***customized hair edit of [Lilyrim's Men's Hairstyles](https://www.patreon.com/posts/public-mens-hair-100889687) from their [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/user?u=11199437)*** *(+Vectorplexus)****!*** *﻿Thanks to [Lilyrim](https://www.patreon.com/user?u=11199437) for permission for being able to use and modify the asset, please check their other stuff!

**However, I do have a FOMOD installer for the new optional cuirass replacer!**
  
  
[font=Trebuchet MS][size=3]⚔[/font] Originally from [85200](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/21655254)'s [AC Black Flag - Edward Kenway outfit](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/111056) - edited the mesh to have **fixed Vanilla Male Body sliders / shape! + Recolored textures & Val's boots!***[/size]*[font=Trebuchet MS][size=3][i][font=Trebuchet MS][size=3]⚔*[/font] Choose between **Amulet version** (**REQUIRES** [/size][/font]**[[font=Trebuchet MS]*Jewelry Collection*[/font]](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74423) by [SiRiUs1503](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/710477)**) or **No Amulet version** (no requirements)

[font=Trebuchet MS][size=3][font=Trebuchet MS][size=3]*[font=Trebuchet MS][size=3]⚔*[/font][/size][/font][/size][/font] [font=Trebuchet MS]*Plugin options: Whether you choose to **use it with Val Soprano**, or **want to use it with other replacers***.[/font]

The plugin was created in **SSEEDIT** (CK hates me atm) and **is ESL**.
  
**Note: I created this replacer in the 1.6.640 version (Plugin v.1.70), and it should work regardless of the new update.**[size=3][size=2][size=2]**NB!**[/size][/size][size=2][size=2] Please do double-check if everything was properly installed on your end.[/size][/size] I test out my mods, but sometimes I might miss something and modlists differ!

Any other Val Serano Replacer - incompatible unless you overwrite!
  
  
Make sure that **'Val Soprano - A Val Serano Replacer.esp'** is loaded **AFTER** any plugins that edit his **NPC record(s)**.**Overwrite ANY** facegen meshes/textures that the files conflicts with to avoid dark face bug.

I kinda couldn't separate a specific nasty part of the Skyrim modding community from the actual Skyrim game itself, and it made the game just rotten to me for some reason, so I kinda stopped playing it.**I decided to just lock comments + just not have comments enabled in my* *maybe(?)* *future mods, in order to just have a peace of mind* *(and to kind of prevent weirdos from entering my PMs hmm...)**.**I know some uh 'weirdos' will twist this into something else**, but I kinda want to stop caring about that ngl, and just focus on
  
having fun modding and playing other games without overlooking mods I just randomly share whenever I feel like it.
