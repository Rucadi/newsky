This mod is part of my series to renovate vanilla characters with additional depth, unique history or personality, and immersive and detailed interaction.
  
  
  
*"I saw a child riding on her father's shoulders, singing our old folk songs. I heard the winds blowing, along with it the friction of sands... And I finally understood. I will never have my home back."*
  
  
  
**How is Rayya envisioned and touched on in this mod:**
  
  
In this mod, Rayya is expanded as a desert warrior **haunted by her past sins and struggling to find redemption.** She **punishes herself by refusing to be loved.** This is almost a **Middle Eastern-themed Western** in an Elder Scrolls setting.
  
  
Rayya was once a simple girl who lived with her father in the grand Alik'r Deserts. The invasion of the Thalmor, and the murder of her father, **forced her to walk a path of vengeance and death,** where she would fight alongside the other Redguard warriors to combat the Golden Eagle from Alinor.
  
  
However, the betrayal of the Empire - and subsequently even her own people - had driven her comrades into banditry and commit sins of their own. They became the very monsters that they once set out to fight.
  
  
**Torn between loyalty, identity, and conscience,** Rayya eventually found sanctuary in Skyrim. Yet, she never found the solace she sought. **She remained a sinner, and her people continued to live in the fire of war.** Skyrim would see her as an outsider, while her people see her as a traitor and murderer.
  
  
Rayya is available as a follower after you become the Thane of Falkreath. Her background story is progressively unlocked as you gain her respect by raising her approval. She is a dual-wielding warrior who is considered **the strongest Housecarl in vanilla game.**
  
  
In the mod, Rayya has a **stoic, contemplative demeanor,** where she is often calm and wise. However, when questioned about the Thalmor, the Empire, or her people, her calmness turns into a burning vengeance which she could never shake off. She still struggles between her hatred and her desire for redemption.
  
  
**Will you help Rayya find redemption and make a home in the lands of Skyrim?**

Q&A
  
  
1. How do I make Rayya look like the video?
  
[Bijin Warmaidens SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1825)2. Where do I find Rayya?
  
Falkreath Jarl's Longhouse
  
Remember, you need to become Falkreath's Thane before getting her
  
  
3. Safe to add mid-save?
  
Safe to add mid-save.
  
  
4. ESL?
  
ESL.
  
  
5. Compatible with...
  
Yes
  
  
6. Does she have any content related to your Shezarrine mod?
  
**Yes.** Most of the Hammerfell lore that she mentions in this mod, especially the lore about the Alik'r, are from my Shezarrine mod.
  
The new lore was written with reference to the Alik'r's unpopularity in Skyrim.
  
  
7. Will there be a FOMOD for the custom follower patches?
  
You are free to make one, as long as it requires the original mod (this mod).
  
I don't know how to make FOMOD.
