# Gore - A Companion Mod

Hello. Thank you, first of all, for reading this. Gore is a passion project for me, one that I work on by myself. He was coded, voiced and worked into the game by me. He has a short intro quest, then becomes a follower. You can find him at Peaks Shade Tower, outside of Falkreath. [u]It would be really nice if you all could endorse the mod. Only 1 out of 94 people who have downloaded Gore have endorsed the file. It means a lot to us as mod authors.

**Don't uninstall mid-playthrough because I use global variables.**

Gore is a child-soldier grown adult, cast off by the family he never truly had following a tragedy. Despite this, the past he is running from is infinitely darker than his future has the potential to be. Gore himself is in love with life, and drinking it in greedy pulls from a deep cup. You'll find he is not so much a broody, quiet type, but more so a very animated and outspoken companion that wears his heart right out on his sleeve.
  
  
As you travel together, you will learn more about his history, his personality, and have the opportunity to form a life-long bond with him, potentially a romantic one, depending on your choices. Gore's story is told across two main quests, a few side quests, and a conclusion that I am currently working on. Take your time, make careful choices, and help him put his torments to rest. The main focus of this mod, however, is to cover your own journey, be that through vanilla faction quests, side quests, or the main quest. I also covered some mods like Vigilant and Saints and Seducers Extended Cut.

In technical terms, he uses a greatsword, heavy armor, and violent aggression to draw enemy attention. His stats and gear are balanced, as he starts with Iron-Tier equipment. You can have him use archery, or a blend of the two as well, just talk to him about planning, and he will be open to it. This is how you adjust his follow distance and **turn on and off his catch-up teleport feature.**I designed him with lore adherence in mind, and I believe I struck a good level of believability for someone not formally educated like Gore. His personality may surprise you, given his name, appearance, etc. but always remember that things are not quite as they seem. Gore is also friendly to nonbinary identities,all you have to do is let him know**,** and he will not use gendered language with you anymore. I didn't do this lazily, I recorded new lines for this specifically.

Gore uses a survival-lite optional system I have built. It is compatible with any survival mods you use by design. It does not punish you for not participating. At the end of your day, you can ask Gore to take you to camp **(Planning > Let's set up camp,)** and he will offer to hunt an animal based on your current region. When you get to camp, he will give you a meal he made and any spare parts from said creature. The meals offer very slight 24 hour buffs to attributes. Rest in camp, craft, harvest alchemy ingredients, and let him know you are ready to leave, and you will be transported right back to where you left. How do you access the flask? Ask him through the camp dialogue menu what else he can cook up. It can be refilled by interacting with the mortar and pestle at camp.

  
* Start and end your days at a secluded camp site
Let Gore hunt animals to make meals for you, these provide 24hr slight buffs to attributes
  
* Collect spare parts from the hunt
Gather ingredients around the camp
  
* Once you get Gore a horse, have access to crafting stations around the camp
Get a flask from Gore with 5 charges, healing 50% of your health each time you use it
  
* Recharge the flask at camp at the end of the day
**Access to:** A mortar and pestle for alchemy, a flat stone to temper armor, a tanning rack, a cooking station, an anvil for crafting, dozens of herbs and ingredients, a sharpening wheel, **most of which show up after completing Gore's horse quest.**
  
* **A nice, quiet, isolated cell. No music, no script lag, no draw calls cloggin' up your fps, just you, Gore, nature, and a nice little break from it all.**

*What is the Alternate Death System?*This is an OPTIONAL system you can opt in or out of in which, when following you and not dismissed, waiting or relaxed, Gore will rescue you from the brink of death, bring you back to camp, and you have a chance to heal before leaving again and facing down whatever killed you. This system is designed with no SKSE or external dependencies, and is designed to save your save files from corruption. When you die in Skyrim, simply loading a save is bad practice. It is actually best to fully close the game and get a clean load by relaunching it. Who has time for that when your game takes 10 minutes to launch? *How do I opt into the system?*Talk to gore at camp, ask him what would he do if something happened to you. It should be pretty obvious the options to either opt in or out. *Any issues?* You will have to manually turn it back on if Gore leaves your service during his questline, goes to jail, goes missing during A Night to Remember or Vigilant. When you have the system on and dismiss him or opt out of the system, your character will make a "hurt" sound. They don't actually get hurt though. It's a lot to explain why this happens, but it's harmless. Gore's Death Alternative System is NOT compatible with other mods that do similar things. Simply do not opt into his system at camp if you use these.

Gore has around 320 lines with her. 
  
[Auri](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11278)
  
Gore has a few idles with Auri, which came not even a week after posting Gore in his fledgling mod state. Auris author was so kind and so available which was honestly amazing as someone who barely had a mod at the time. 
  
[Simple Outfit System](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48974) 
  
I know followers have issues equipping what you'd like them to, and despite nerfing Gore's equipment down to Iron-Tier﻿ quality, you may still have issues with getting him to equip what you'd like. This is a vanilla bug, I apologize I can't fix it.
  
[SNIFF - Simple No Internal Friendly Fire](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43618?tab=files)Don't often recommend these, but quite frankly this is just a good mod to have. I can deconflict things on my end, but I cannot fix the base game. Came pretty close with his horse though.

**You can, of course, use him with mods like NFF installed, just do not use the dialogue option to integrate him into them.**

My beta testers for playtesting.
  
[CVEO's](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/160705) eye meshes. Looks so much better! Also, LDD provided the overlay that gives Gore acne. Which is realistic, because you know. He's young.
  
[FuzzBeed](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/TheOneTrueFuzzBeed?gameId=1704) was commissioned to make a house for Pate. The tent was always just a placeholder, but I put this off for too long.

Spoiler"Installation?"
  
Load Gore.esm as high as you possibly can. Follower mods change nothing, but touch many things.
  
  
"Safe to add mid-playthrough?"
  
It is, at least in the case of the mainline mod. I don't recommend doing that, because I personally believe Gore is best when gotten at a low level, but to each their own. In the case of the Vigilant addon, abso-fucking-LUTELY not if you have started Vigilant at all. Neither his mods nor his addons are safe to remove mid-playthrough, either.
  
  
"Is this finished?"
  
~~Yes. I posted a long statement about it in the pinned comments.~~ ABSOLUTELY FUCKING NOT.
  
  
"Romance?"
  
Romance. You have to earn it, though. There is a very, very narrow passage you must get through to have access to it. It is not difficult to achieve if you are a decent person, though.
  
  
"Is anyone going to read this?"
  
No.[color=#f4f4f4][/color]

general content warning below:Spoiler This mod touches on some personal subjects that may upset you. His personal quests are optional, and you can avoid any of this by not pursuing them. I am not a writer, I was blessed with the gift of drawing on my own experiences to shape his story, meaning it was a bit easier for me to make him believable. That being said, I am not Gore. Gore is not me. He is not a self-insert, but rather a vessel meant to convey a message that victims should not be expected to be perfect people. I drew inspiration from my experience as a veteran, a CSA survivor, and other shitty experiences that shaped my life, but I also drew from Eden's experiences as well as others. Despite the heavy themes, this is a story of healing, kinship, and blood. the metaphorical kind, specifically. Chosen family, and its validity. This mod was for trans people first and foremost. It's for people whose family has let them down. It's a story about finding that acceptance and love with your chosen kin, and it's a story about finding happiness.
