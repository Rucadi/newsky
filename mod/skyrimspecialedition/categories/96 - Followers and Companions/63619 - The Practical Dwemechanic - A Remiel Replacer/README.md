**The Practical Dwemechanic**
  

  
* [Remiel](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51874)﻿ is a wonderfully written custom-voiced follower created by [Maplespice](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/97166548)﻿. She's a researcher with an intense interest in the Dwemer and a knack for Dwemer machines, which is why she fashions herself as a "Dwemechanic". She's a delightful companion to have along your travels with her hilarious and informative musings on the Dwemer, her thief's instincts, and her ability to heal you. *And* she comes with her own Dwarven Spider companion, Scrap, the bestest of boys!
I wanted to give Remi an appearance tweak to fit the persona of a Dwemechanic, with a bit of a more textured face (freckles, moles, and scars, oh my!) and a more subdued lower bun with some wispy hairs breaking free. I also gave her a neat little Dwemer-themed necklace and some cool golden ear piercings. 
  
* Remi will still use your installed body and skin textures.

  
  
**Installation**
  

  
* Download and Install with your preferred mod manager.
Make sure HLIORemiMakeover.esp loads after HLIORemi.esp and you should be good to go!
  

  
  
**Compatibility**
  

  
* Will be compatible with anything that doesn't edit Remi's actor record directly, but will need a patch for anything that does.
