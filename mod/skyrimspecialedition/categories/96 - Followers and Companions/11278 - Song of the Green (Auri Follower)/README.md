----------------

**Song of the Green** is a fully voiced follower and quest mod, which centers around Bosmer culture and tradition.
  
Auri, a traditionalist Wood Elf archer, will follow you, do your bidding, and offer occasional
  
snarky commentary about your surroundings and actions.
  
  
If you want, that will be the extent of your relationship. If you choose to, however, expressing interest in Bosmeri culture and Auri herself, will make your companion open up to you, and perhaps reveal more about the reasons for her arrival in Skyrim.  The more you speak to her, the more she will have to say, and finishing her mini-quest will unlock more idle commentary, and several conversations.

FAQ:
  
  
Where is she?
  
In Falkreath Hold. Look for Auri's Pod on your map.
  
  
Help! Auri keeps punching dragons!
  
She's out of arrows. Give her some arrows, or ask her to use her daggers instead.
  
  
Auri won't use gear/arrows/food I give her!
  
Auri has two inventories. Her regular inventory is just for storage. To give her armor and weapons to use, select dialogue:
  
"Let's talk about traveling together" --> "Let me check your gear."
  
  
Where can I get bone arrows?
  
Auri can buy 20 of them at the Drunken Huntsman, or you can craft them at the tanning rack. She'll use any arrows you give her, though.
  
  
I'm at the camp by Evergreen grove, but there are no new conversation options!
  
-Wait until nightfall. Some conversations are best had at night by a campfire.
  
  
Will you add a vanilla marriage option?
  
Nope.
  
  
Help! Auri hates me!
  
-It seems you've managed to accuse her of being a Thalmor spy. She doesn't like that. To avoid this, don't choose dialogue options marked as "hostile."
  
  
I'm playing Xbox, and I have a problem with...
  
I did not make the Xbox port, and I can't give any support with it, sorry!

Known Issues:
  
  
Song of the Green is my first ever mod, built slowly with the help of online tutorials, trial and error, and the help of some very patient modder friends. As a result, the mod still has many little bugs and quirks that I simply lack the experience to fix. I ask for your patience and understanding when encountering any issues, I'm still learning.
  
  
-Thistlefoot, Auri's mount, is an agent of chaos beyond our understanding. Most likely secretly a daedra.
  
 He may sometimes appear where he shouldn't.
