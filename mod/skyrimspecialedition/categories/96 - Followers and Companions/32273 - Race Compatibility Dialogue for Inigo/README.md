**Description:**

  
Inspired by Aelarr's Race compatibility dialogue mod I decided to just make my own for [Smartbluecat's amazing Inigo](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1461) mod.
  
  
Inigo has a ton of lines based on your character's race, that you would miss if you were playing as a custom race.
  
 This mod fixes that. As long as your custom race has the "Actorproxy(race)" keyword, Inigo will treat your character as a member of that race.
  
  
**Example:** If the race has "Actorproxykhajiit" he will treat your character as a fellow khajiit.
  
  
**Install:** Just download with your preferred mod manager and enable the esp. Or
  
download it manually and drop the esp in Skyrim SE's data folder. 
  
  
**Requirements:** Just the [Race Compatibility](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2853) mod since it uses the keywords from that mod and every custom race mod requires it.
  
  
**Recommended:** Aelarr's [Race compatibility Dialogue](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17595) mod since it covers the base game and so so so many mods.
