This mod is part of my series to renovate vanilla characters with additional depth, unique history or personality, and immersive and detailed interaction.
  
  
  
*"I'm not sure if I should feel happy or sad. My taxes are funding these useless Penitus Oculatus."*-During the quest "Breaching Security"
  
  
  
**How is Camilla envisioned and touched on in this mod:**
  
  
In this mod, Camilla is expanded as a **young, eager woman who longs for excitement but feels trapped in the monotony of Riverwood.** She dreams of seeing the world and experiencing its beauty, but her responsibilities to her family's business keep her grounded. If you manage to take her on as a companion, you'll find her to be an affectionate friend or wife who enjoys good food and cherishes her family deeply.
  
  
Camilla's story begins in Cyrodiil, where she grew up as a merchant's daughter. After the Great War, Cyrodiil suffered economic and political decline, leading to rampant crime. Her parents died during a robbery attempt, leaving her brother Lucan as the sole caretaker of their family business and his little sister. **Though the siblings have their conflicts, they are all each other has left.**
  
  
The dire business environment in Cyrodiil eventually drove Lucan and Camilla to Skyrim in search of greener pastures. While they found stability in Riverwood, Camilla now faces a new challenge: boredom and obscurity. **As a young woman in her prime, she yearns to explore the world and experience its wonders.**
  
  
To make matters more complicated, she finds herself caught between two suitors - both simple villagers - who try their worst to vie for her attention! 
  
  
**Will you save Camilla from the monotony of Riverwood and show her the world?**
  
  
In this mod, Camilla has an affectionate and kind demeanor, with a subtle, light-hearted sense of humor. While she is not an effective fighter, she does her best to support you.
  
  
**Camilla is not a follower in vanilla Skyrim, but this mod allows you to recruit her** by completing the quest "The Golden Claw", resolving the love triangle in Riverwood, reaching Level 10, and persuading Lucan to let his sister join you on your adventures.

**Q&A**
  
  
1. How do I make Camilla look like the video?
  
[Camilla Valerius Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41236)
  
  
2. Where do I find Camilla?
  
Riverwood. You need to be at least Level 10 for Lucan to entrust you with Camilla's safety.
  
  
3. ESL?
  
ESL.
  
  
4. Safe to add mid-save?
  
Safe to add mid-save.
  
  
5. Compatible with...
  
Yes
  
  
6. Does she have any content related to your Shezarrine mod?
  
Very little content related to the Empire's situation, done in a lore-friendly way that makes sense for her character. Possibility for future expansion.
  
It describes how the Empire's economy declined after the Great War and the tax rate got higher, that it became difficult for commoners to do business in Cyrodiil, especially when facing competition from oligarchs of the colossal East Empire Company.
  
Expanded from her vanilla lines about how the Great War ruined everything in Cyrodiil.
