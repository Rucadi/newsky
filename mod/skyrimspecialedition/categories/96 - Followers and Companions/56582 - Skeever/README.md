**About Skeever**

He Hates Vampires again!**What's his story?**
  
I can say he is a Breton who is drunk without drinking, he does not know why this happens and this is where you come in. I assure you there is much more to him than just a simple follower, it will also slowly become clear how come he knows so much about so much, yet is always confused at the same time.
  
He is worried and sometimes sneaky, but most of the time he is "True Good", he calls it as he sees it and does not have full control of which words leave his mouth.
