Ok please do not stone me or ban me.
  
  
TwoBears Sacrifice is a unique fella. He can be found in Whiterun, drunken huntsman tavern. He is made to be an enjoyable and somewhat funnier fella. Has nothing to do with any real life person at all. This is just a fiction work.
  
  
This mod has been created in a cooperation with CoralineKoralina and me, for a collection i curated. You do not need to have the collection or anything else to run this mod at all.
