08/04/25 | The first batch of Daedric quest commentary has been released. Next update will feature the other half. In the future, commentary with Serana Dialogue Add-On 4.3 is planned. After that, hopefully I can work on her origin quest line. Haven't gotten around to it because of school and other projects and just being a bit burnt out of this mod and Skyrim as a whole.**
  
  
**Voice Demo down below in the video!**
  
﻿﻿﻿﻿
  
  
Celine is an adorable talking fox with a mysterious origin. Silly but compassionate and caring, Celine is eager to join you for your adventures! Fully voiced by the wonderful **[Shykodah-Khi McGrath (Vyxenah),](https://www.shykodah-khi.com/)﻿** Celine has over 840 professionally voiced lines with more planned for the future.
  
  
She can be found in the **city of Riften,** around the **cemetery and Talos statue.** She is marked as essential and comes with a teleport spell once you've completed her introduction quest. In combat, she is fierce and quite capable of holding her own. Her base attack damage is set to 20 and she infinitely scales with the player's level, gaining both health and stamina per level. Additionally, she has a 50% resistance to frost (like many animals), moves at 200% speed and has sneak and the light footed perk to help with stealth and avoiding traps.
  
  
Celine has a playful personality and doesn't take things too seriously. She can also be quite naïve and scared at times of certain enemies and locations. In the future, she will receive a fully custom questline that will expand on her past and explain her backstory.
  
  
If you're wondering why it's Celine and not Céline (sorry French speakers), the é is hard to type on a keyboard and it makes it easier for work in the Creation Kit, as well as for people searching the mod.﻿﻿﻿

What Does the Fox Wear
  
  
  
**\*Note on giving/trading gear:** She will equip armor and other accessories as part of the vanilla trade system. Armor stats and enchantments will apply but her appearance will not change. Her animal predator class does not scale with any armor so she will be stuck at a low rating if you do give gear. If you want to increase her attack damage, give fortify unarmed enchants.
  
  
As of the 1.2.0 update, there is a quest to craft new armor for her to wear that you can give to her. These armors will appear on her and also have high armor stats to account for her lack of armor perks.

There will be more commentary for future quests such as Daedric and side quests! There will also be more "What's on your mind" topics, and follower banter with [Marty's Ashe follower](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/135085) and Serana from [Serana Dialogue Add-on](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32161) (when Kerstyn is back from hiatus in 2025). You guys may actually recognize me from Ashe and SDA's mod page and the Discord and if you do, then you know all about me already and what to expect.
  
Celine will have her own new questline that has the player and Celine embarking on a journey to discover her past. This will come some other time in the future eventually. This is in addition to the new existing custom quests that have the player and Celine spending time together.
  
  
Stay tuned for these updates by tracking the mod page so you know when it gets released!

**As of the 1.1.0 update and onward, I have made Celine with the newest Creation Kit so if you are still on older versions of Skyrim, then make sure you have the [BEES mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441) or you will have issues with your game as a whole.**
  
  
When installing, you should use a mod manager like MO2 or Vortex as opposed to manually downloading.
  
  
**\*I do [recommend that you get this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76533) to silence the vanilla fox breathing sounds (as they apply to Celine as well).**
  
**\*Make sure that you aren't adding her into any follower framework as like any other custom follower, they tend to break the follower.** If you have AFT you need to uninstall it as it tends to cause issues regardless of what you do with it. Also do not run any other mods that affect things like home markers or schedules, packages, etc.
  
  
Installing mid-save is fine. If you plan on uninstalling the mod, you should be fine to do so mid-save. I recommend using [Resaver](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5031/) though to check if there are any loose scripts to clean/remove.
  
  
For future updates, they are fine to install mid-save, just make sure to **uninstall all older versions of the mod** before installing the latest.
  
  
If you have SR Exterior Cities Series 2.0 and can't see Celine, [download this patch and follow its instructions.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/150656?tab=files)
  
  
**Also, if there is a dialogue option to update the mod, please select it! (it helps to update the quest aliases)**
