For OnePiece fans out there, here is a follower that we took inspiration from, Zoro!
  
He is really not the most close looking one, but it was as close as we can get with Vanilla assets. You have been warned!
  
  
Still a work in progress.
  
  
Zoro is waiting for you in Whiterun, inside Warmaidens. Hope you'll like him!
