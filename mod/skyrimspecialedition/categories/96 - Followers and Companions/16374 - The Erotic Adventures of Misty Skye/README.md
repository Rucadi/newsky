The legends tell
  
That in the age of the dragons' return
  
There lived a babe of great hottness
  
Bodacious of titty and fine of ass
  
Who painted her hair red as wine
  
And it is told
  
That in seductive states of undress
  
She would jiggle her ample charms
  
Through taverns and palaces
  
Inspiring showers of coin
  
And declarations of love
  
And awkward public boners
  
From beggars and from kings
  
And it is told
  
That the boobies of her chest
  
Were soft and pink and lovely
  
As the clouds of autumn sunrise
  
And so the name given her
  
Was Misty Skye
  
  
And her sister was also hot

The first quest will begin when you approach the Drunken Huntsman in Whiterun
  
and read one of the sexy new posters that have appeared outside the doors.
  
  
Misty will have many more things to say and do as you travel with her. 
  
Take your time, and try chatting with her now and then as you progress!
  
  
Summer Skye will be available as a companion once Misty has been rescued!

  

[size=5]Requirements / Compatibility:
  
  
Requires [XPMSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1988) skeleton
  
  
Misty and Summer are not vanilla followers. They will not conflict
  
with other follower mods, but will not use features of those mods, either.
  
  
  
This mod uses UUNP bodies but does not require UUNP. Outfits built for CBBE might look
  
weird on these characters, but their default outfits will always look like the screenshots.
  
Let me say this louder for the people in the back:
  
***YOU CAN USE THIS MOD with CBBE and it WORKS FINE!!***
  
  
If your mod manager tells you that this conflicts KS Hair, it really doesn't. I just bundled the
  
required files into the archive (no changes made) since they're free to redistribute.
  
**This shouldn't conflict with anything at all,** but let me know if you run into any issues.[/size]
