**[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]﻿Nether's Vex[/font]**

  
- Enhanced version of Vex with custom perks, combat style and abilities.
  
- Tons of unique, custom dialogue and idles.
  
- Easily assign up to 5 outfits and easily switch between them.
  
- Customize mod features via the MCM menu. Yes, you can turn off features you don't like.
  
  
**REQUIREMENTS:**- Dawnguard and Dragonborn must be installed and active in your load order.
  
- SKSE64
  
- SkyUI (there is an MCM provided)
  
- UNP or CBBE-based body (vanilla body is not supported)
  
  
**INSTALLATION:**- Fomod Installer (supports SSE or LE). LE version is a backwards port from SSE to LE, use at your own risk.
  
- Choose Body Type (CBBE or UNP)
  
- Choose Hair Color.
  
  
**ACQUIRING:**- You must be part of the Thieves Guild to try to acquire Vex as a follower. This means you must have completed the intro quest "Taking Care of Business", where you extort some of Riften's townsfolk for money.
  
- Once you have completed this, you can choose the dialogue option "May I ask you something?". This makes a roll using your Speech skill plus a bonus based on how many main quests you've done for the Guild along with any quests that Vex offers (Burgulary, Shill, etc). If successful, Vex will join you and will be treated as a follower under most circumstances. Otherwise, you can attempt to ask her again in 8 hours, game time.
  
  
**FOLLOWER EXCEPTIONS:**- Vex will leave your service once you progress far enough along the Thieves Guild questline to where Mercer accompanies you to hunt down Karliah. This is done to preserve the storyline. After you return to the Guild with Karliah, later on, and the events with the vault play out, you can recruit Vex again (after investigating Mercer's house). There should be indicators when this happens.
  
- Vex will leave your service if you commit crimes against the guild (the quest "Reparations"). You can reacquire her once you pay your debt.
  
  
**THIEVES GUILD and VANILLA CHANGES:**- It's somewhat tricky to get Vex to work as a follower, since she is a key NPC used in other quests along with trying to provide as much compatiblity with other mods as possible. For the most part, this mod should not conflict with other Thieves Guild mods unless they directly change Vex's dialogue options.
  
- Dialogue was added to the Marriage system. This shouldn't affect other mods unless they extensively change this and should have nothing to do with multiple adoption mods.
  
- Adds comments when viewing an impressive site, approaching entrances to dungeons, there is danger or she is healed by others.
  
- Several basic informative dialogues were changed with conditions so that they are only spoken once, in order to clean up dialogue clutter (Talking about: Trouble at Goldenglow, guild services, doing extra jobs, the glory days, etc).
  
- Thieves Guild Hellos and Goodbyes for Vex were given conditions that most of those are only spoken if you are in the Flagon and Vex is not a follower.
  
- Many of her snarky responses when asking for jobs are less prominent if she has higher relationship with you.
  
  
**APPEARANCE**:
  
- Modernizes but keeps the aesthetic style of Vex with high-poly head.
  
- Vex now has a ponytail as I feel pulled back (or short) hair would be better for an infiltrator.
  
- Scultped face, customized face overlay.
  
- Choice of multiple hair colors in the installer: White (default), Blond or Red.
  
- Includes face, brow and eye textures. Eye textures are customized.
  
- Includes head and body maps (UNP and CBBE based bodies). Attention to seams between body parts.
  
- There are two different texture sets and both are hand-tweaked. The UNP texture uses Fair Skin Complexion while the CBBE uses a combination of Fair Skin and Pure Skin.
  
  
**VOICE, RELATIONSHIP and INTERACTION:**- Vex has many customized voice lines - a combination of the VA Synth tool and in-game lines that are re-appropriated. All are tweaked in Audacity. These include a variety of different lines, such as: idles, interactions, hellos, goodbyes and combat.
  
- Relationship system that increases in time and when fighting beside her. Starts at Indifferent and progresses to Agreeable, Loyal then Fond. At Fond, she can be married. Each "level" is based on a point system.
  
- Relationship Points: Just spending time gets you around 4-7 points per hour. You will often be awarded and additional 8 points per hour if you are running through dungeons with her. Doing main Thieves Guild quests awards around 12 per quest. Doing her jobs awards around 15 points per job completed. Takes around 700 points, total, to get to Fond.
  
- Several lines will change or be added, based on the built-in Relationship system. Initially, she will be passive-aggressive and disinterested. This should progress to being neutral, then more open and finally friendly to the player.

Special Abilities:
  
- Most of Vex's abilities are dagger-based to give her a unique take. She has no innate ranged ability but can use a staff or bow if you wish.
  
- Does not affect player's stealth meter.
  
- Dual wield.
  
- Dagger Play: Dagger attacks do +3 damage, +6 damage if Vex is in shadow (under 45 light level). She has a 15% chance to stagger opponents and 12% chance to knock them down. Stagger and Knockdown are resisted versus Shock.
  
- Advance: While in combat and moving, Vex's speed is increased by 25 in order to close in on opponents.
  
- Dagger Speed: Vex attacks 20% faster with daggers, this increases slightly every 10 levels.
  
- Sidestep: Vex reduces incoming physical and magical damage by 20%.
  
- Healing Salve: If under 30% health, Vex can drink a potion to restore 15% of her health and 50 points of Stamina. Can only occur once per 12 seconds.
  
  
**Ability Bonuses:**Spoiler- You can customize Vex by applying up to 3 ability bonuses (initially), that modify her special abilities or add new features. Only the first 4 of these abilities are known initially, with a new one granted each time she levels with the player (must be a follower). There are 10 bonuses in total. Once Vex learns the first 7 abilities, a 4th bonus can be applied. When all 10 are learned, a 5th bonus can be applied.
  
These are the bonuses, in order:
  
- Pursuit (Intial): Advance now increases combat running and sprinting speed by 40% (up from 25%). Furthermore, Vex cannot be slowed or staggered while running/sprinting during combat.
  
- Restoration (Intial): Vex's Salve ability restores 25% of her health (up from 15%).
  
- Daze (Intial): Vex has an increased chance to stagger opponents (18% chance, up from 15%).
  
- Duelist (Intial): Dagger Play can now be used with any 1-handed weapons but only do +2 additional damage, +4 if Vex is in shadow. Non-daggers also receive the stagger and knockdown benefits.
  
- Unbalance: It is easier for Vex to knockdown opponents, raising her chance to 16% (up from 12%).
  
- Evasion: Sidestep now reduces 24% of damage (up from 18%).
  
- Winded: When an opponent is affected by Vex's knockdown, there is a 25% chance they will be disarmed.
  
- Second Wind: Once per hour, Vex can restore 75% of her health when using Salve.
  
- Into The Fray: Vex is able to move quickly to enemies by teleporting to them. Upon arriving, all nearby enemies are staggered. Can only occur once per 30 seconds and the timer resets when first entering into combat. Vex doesn't need to be able to path to enemies but does need line of sight to them. When combat ends for Vex and the player is also not in combat, she will teleport to the player - this is to help prevent her getting stuck in unusual areas.
  
- Flurry: Vex's melee attacks cause enemies to lose 1 point of Stamina and Magicka per second for 10 seconds. This ability stacks per hit delivered.
  
Non-Combat Abilities:
  
- Increased Lockpicking: 15% increased lockpicking chance is granted to the player once reaching Loyal relationship rank with Vex. Vex must be a follower to grant this bonus to simulate that she is helping the player.
  
- Thieves Affinity: When reaching Fond relationship, the player has 12% better prices when buying or selling from a Fence as long as Vex is currently a follower.
  
  
**OUTFIT SYSTEM**You can create up to 5 outfits for Vex via dialogue. When the first outfit is created, it will automatically be worn. Additional outfits can be worn by asking them to wear them.
  
It is recommended that you keep all of their wearable items in their extra storage inventory, which is an unlimited storage space. This is to keep Skyrim's engine from accidentally overwriting any loose wearable items, which might be represented in the same body slot as an outfit item.
  
  
In the MCM you can assign a hotkey that can be used to switch to any outfits defined for them. If a specific follower is in the crosshair, it will only affect that follower. Otherwise, both will be affected if an outfit is defined in the slot you select.
  
In the MCM, you can also activate an Outfit Preview Mode. This moves their inventory around temporarily to allow them to be treated as if you are directly trading the items to them so that they wear them in real time. This setting does move items around to a temporary container.
  
  
**HOME SYSTEM**Via dialogue, you can define her home location. You can choose a base location and once that is defined, you can additional choose between day (6am to 2pm) and night (10pm to 6am) locations. You can also choose which times they sleep (6am, 2pm or 10pm). Sleep lasts for 6 hours and they must be able to find an unowned bed.
