[font=Comic Sans MS]***Why another face for Lucien ?***
  
> There are no shortage of face replacers for Joseph's popular Lucien follower mod .
>   
>   
> No offense to other authors , while I am sure all of they've done a terrific job but personally I think they are looking a little too " seasoned ". So I have decided to make my own .
>   
>   
> Lucien is this green horn  /  fresh face  /  aspiring new adventurer who has just started his journey . 
>   
> I gave him a roundier face , fairer skins  ( make sense for someone who spent most of his times in the library ) so he doesn't look too haggard .
>   
>   
> At the same time I've taken some reference from Joseph's (Lucien's mod Author) facial features , matching hairs , colors and eyes since I do not want the look to stray too far from its original intent .

  
  
**Read This First**
  
  
This head will use your **own male body mesh and textures** . 
  
If you need to take off Lucien 's clothes for w/e reason , you will find that he has a **neck gap** . 
  
  
\*The Solution\*
  
  
[/font]

  
1. [font=Comic Sans MS]To fix the gap , you need to bring up the console menu with the ~ key . [/font]
[font=Comic Sans MS]Move your mouse cursor over Lucien , click him.  Or if you feel like being edgy , you can do /prid " Insert Lucien's REFid here "[/font]
  
2. [font=Comic Sans MS]Type Setnpcweight 25 , press Enter . Do not close the window yet[/font]
[font=Comic Sans MS]Type disable , press Enter . [/font]
  
3. [font=Comic Sans MS]Type enable , press Enter . Press the ~ key again to leave the console command menu . [/font]

  
[font=Comic Sans MS]This should cause Lucien to respawn with his new weight in the current save file , subsequently eliminating the Neck Gap issue . If you wish to start a new game , you may have to [/font]**re-enter** [font=Comic Sans MS]the same commands . [/font]
  
  
  
  
***Recommendation & Compatibility***
  
  
**\*Not compatible with any other Lucien face replacers , obviously .
  
  
The face is compatible with Tempered Skin for Males , Sam light , HIMBO , SOS , SkySight , BNP and Vitruvia .**[font=Comic Sans MS]This Lucien should run well under most ENB . [/font]
  
[font=Comic Sans MS]Even without ENB , you will find him a touch better looking than the fellas around thanks to the increased Vertices .[/font]
  
[font=Comic Sans MS]If you find that offensive to your gameplay , just uninstall the mod . [/font]
  
  
[font=Comic Sans MS]This mod also pairs well with the following : [/font]
  
  
**[Expressive Facial Animation - Male edition](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19532)﻿  -** [font=Comic Sans MS]Strongly recommended , I've altered the face with this in mind so this Lucien should look slightly more expressive than before . [/font]
  
  
[Gesture Animation Remix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64420)[font=Comic Sans MS]  -  Highly recommended  , this mod added extra distinct poses and animation for Lucien . [/font]
  
  
  
[font=Comic Sans MS]That's the whole package ! You will find Lucien more lively and expressive than before ![/font]
  
  
  
  
  
***Future Plans***
  
~~add more hairstyles~~
  
~~add more options for face features~~
  
~~add more compatibility options for different body mesh~~[font=Comic Sans MS] [/font]
  
**\*HIMBO & SOS default & Vitruvia & BNP compatibility added in v1.2**
  
**[font=Comic Sans MS]Added BNP updates and SkySight supports in v1.5

> [font=Comic Sans MS]**What is this face ?**[/font]
>   
>   
> [font=Comic Sans MS]This is a standalone facegen replacer , created partially using Charmers of the reach ( COTR ) .
>   
>   
> Because it is relatively new , the lack of compatibility with many of the newer mods can be problematic  .
>   
> Male assets especially so because they receive very little attention and support .
>   
>   
> Face is sculpted meticulously in Zbrush , I paid attention down to the smallest extreme details , from eyelid down to teeth . 
>   
>   
> I've probably ran hundreds of instances of Facial Expression demo just to make he doesn't clip or have teeth protuding at the wrong place . Vertex around eyes have been slightly altered and the nose bridge and teeth have been smoothen .

[font=Comic Sans MS]**Why Cosmos Lucien ?**[/font][font=Comic Sans MS]
  
Because our Lucien is like a little Universe  , with Limitless Potential and all that blah blah blah .
  
The truth is I was struggling to find a name so I just named it that . 
  
[/font][font=Comic Sans MS]
  
**Share the preset pretty pls ?**[/font]
  
[font=Comic Sans MS]
  
The shape of the assets are sculpted in Zbrush. I don't really use Racemenu much except for saving files . Unless you are using the exact same assets which I am using , it is unlikely you can load the exact same shape from a racemenu preset. So that is just not possible atm .[/font]
  
  
  
***[font=Comic Sans MS]
  
[/font]***[font=Comic Sans MS]**This is just a simple face replacer, why are you typing so much ?**[/font]
  
  
[font=Comic Sans MS]Because I rather address some of the things before ppl brought it up ?  [/font]
  
[font=Comic Sans MS]Because I rather save us times ? [/font]
  
[font=Comic Sans MS]Because I am being a decently responsible modder ? [/font]
