This mod is part of my series to renovate vanilla characters with additional depth, unique history or personality, and immersive and detailed interaction.
  
  
  
*"Mountains of research papers piled up on my desk, dozens of peer evaluation requests I've yet to entertain, and you ask me to travel?"*
  
  
  
**How is Faralda envisioned and touched on in this mod:**
  
  
In this mod, Faralda is made into a **fully fledged follower** and expanded as a **nerdy and capable** professor. Coming from Alinor which is ruled by the Thalmor, she has strong opinions about tyrants and oppressors.
  
  
She joins you after you **complete the quest "Containment" and her research notes quest.** Throughout the questline, she will watch out for you and provide her insights. **She will gradually grow to trust and depend on you.**
  
  
Faralda has a **nerdy, professional demeanor.** She has a sensible outlook on things and will add her dry humor to your adventure.
  
  
Will you discover the secrets of the arcane - and **fight monsters with your College Professor?**

3. Many new story-driven interactions
  
4. Personal quests
  
5. Location-awareness, including cities and dungeons
  
6. Completely lore-friendly, expanding rather than completely rewriting the character

This mod is **100% compatible with any mod**.
  
  
**Safe to add and update mid-save.**
  
  
There is a potential for **future expansion** with Faralda including **optional** synergy with the overarching Shezarrine Saga
