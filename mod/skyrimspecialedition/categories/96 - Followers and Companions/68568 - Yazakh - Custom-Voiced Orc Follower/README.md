**Description**
  
﻿Yazakh is an Orc follower with over 1000 lines of custom dialogue, most of which is finally voiced. You can find her in the Winking Skeever, drowning her sorrows and being disillusioned with her membership at the Bards College. Anxious and self-loathing, she doesn't fit in with others of her kind but doesn't fit in very well with anyone else either, perhaps even including you.
  
  
**Features**
  

  
* Has a personality. Whether it's a pleasant one or not is up to you to decide, but it *is* a personality.
Primarily fights as a spellsword, with her magical skills revolving around Alteration and Restoration.
  
* Runs on her own custom follower framework, which means A) she can be used alongside other followers right out of the box and B) you shouldn't import her into another framework as it might break her brain.
Fairly extensive dialogue, including commentary on the main quest, the Dawnguard and Dragonborn questlines, and the Companions and College of Winterhold questlines. I recommend recruiting her as early as possible for this reason.
  
* Has interactions with **[Remiel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51874)﻿** and [Thogra gra-Mugur](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120007).﻿

  
**Are there any incompatibilities I should know about?**While it's not recommended to use follower framework mods on her, she is designed to be compatible with mods that change her home base like [My Home is Your Home](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7096), so feel free to assign a new home for her that's not just the Winking Skeever.
  
Mods that change the Winking Skeever's interior should be OK, since this mod doesn't make any changes to that location other than placing Yazakh within it, but you may want to be careful regardless.
  
  
**So is this the finished version of the mod?**Absolutely not. There are a whole bunch of other features planned, including new quests, more dialogue and conversations (including interactions with other quest and follower mods), a romance option (tbc), even her own horse (...if she ever wants to learn of course). But we'll see what the future holds.
  
  
**Has she been playtested at least?**Yes. I'm somewhat better at playing Skyrim than I am at creating mods for it so I can personally verify that she worked for a whole playthrough, but obviously further feedback would be much appreciated.
  
  
**She looks too much like a vanilla Orc for my liking. Can you make her prettier?**Define "prettier".
  
  
**Is there a LE backport for the mod?**
  
Yes, and you can find it [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/115685)﻿, courtesy of [step210](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/52136466).
