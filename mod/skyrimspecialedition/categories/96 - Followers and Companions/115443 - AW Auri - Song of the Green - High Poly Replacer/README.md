**UPDATE FOR AURI 2.0**
  
  
The new update only includes the facegen, will still use the original skin and other textures.
  
No ESP.
  
  
Since the original mod includes a custom skin and I think it's a BHUNP skin, I also provide a patch for people that use **3BA and other CBBE-based bodies** in the optional files.
  
(it will override her skin with [my skin blend](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/136930))
  
  
=======
  
  
Old version:
  
  
I've been wanting to do this for a while and finally had the chance to go back to my first attempts and perfect her final look.
  
I tried to stay close to the original but fixed a few things, gave her a facelift and high poly head.
  
  
She will use your default skin and body, so she's compatibile with everything.
  
  
Install my mod after the main mod [Song of the Green](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11278) and overwrite all conflicting files.
  
  
**ESP flagged light.**---
