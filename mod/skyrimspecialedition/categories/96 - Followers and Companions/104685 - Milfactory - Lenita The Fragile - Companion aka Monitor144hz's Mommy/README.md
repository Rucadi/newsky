Lenita the fragile aka Monitor144hz's mommy is a half-imperial lady. What else is her other half, one may ask. Well, little known about Lenita's father. He was a man from a land far far away to the east, beyond the land of Tamriel and the Padomaic ocean. Lenita grew up with her father's tales of a mysterious place where he came from, hoping one day she can visit her ancestral land. One fateful day, when she was still a young lady, her father  ̶w̶e̶n̶t̶ ̶o̶u̶t̶ ̶g̶o̶ ̶b̶u̶y̶ ̶m̶i̶l̶k̶ boarded on a ship in hope of finding his way back to his homeland, but never returned. His ship is rumored to be sunked by storm. Lenita is recently staying at Makarth, inside Silver Blood Inn, looking for a way to enter the mysterious Sky Heaven Temple with hope of finding more clue about her ancestral land.
  
  
Why the nickname "Monitor's Mommy"? Well, it's a joke much like Sswaye's mom. When I first posted her character design in a discord server, [Monitor144hz](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/118625818)really likes her, I tried to hold her hostage to make him improve a certain mod of his, but he never did. So I release her anyway. 
  
  
Why the nickname "The Fragile"? Let's just say she used to be skinny and [looked *fragile*](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/images/175347).
  
But since then she has.... uhm... gained some weight, in the right places. But the name stays. Just... remind her to excercise.
  
  
As a Milfactory custom follower, she requires the[Milfactory Asset Hub](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80819) to work.
  
  
Some additional info:
  
  

  
* She is a (half) Imperial

* She is marriageable
She has 100 weight.
  
* She is specialized in one handed, dual wielding, and skilled with a bow.
She is at Silver Blood Inn - Makarth
  
* All screenshots were taken on BHUNP version.
This mod is compatible with both BHUNP and 3BA version of the [Asset Hub](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80819)﻿.
  
* Be very very nice to her.
