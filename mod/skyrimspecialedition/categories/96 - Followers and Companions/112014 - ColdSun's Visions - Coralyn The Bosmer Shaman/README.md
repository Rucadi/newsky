Here is the Visions version of Coralyn. There are no new features from the Pantheon version other than the features from Visions mod architecture itself and the fact that there is an ESPFE version available now. That said, there are some things you should know should you choose to use this version instead of the Pantheon version:

* [font=Verdana]The ESPFE version is best used with a new game. That said, you can try using it with an existing game but you may run into issues with two MCM menus until you clean your save. You should never have two versions of Coralyn installed - if you try that prepare for the worst.[/font]
[font=Verdana]If you are using a replacer for Coralyn (how dare you!? I kid I kid) then you will need to stick with the Pantheon version. Just keep in mind that Pantheon is no longer being worked on and when I add more features to these followers they won't be handed down to Pantheon versions.[/font]
  
* [font=Verdana]The ESPFE version also does not work with OPrivacy and Naughty Voices.[/font]
[font=Verdana]You can safely use the non-ESL version in any scenario[/font]
  
* [font=Verdana]Coralyn's OPrivacy approach is known to be incompatible with Quickloot SE. You can turn off Quickloot SE through a feature in its MCM to enable Coralyn's OPrivacy approach and then switch it back on after she approaches.[/font]

The Coralyn is a wood elf (Bosmer) that grew up in Valenwood and has traveled to Skyrim to escape her own people. She is around 75 years old (which in human years would be considered to be early to mid-20s years in age). She has brown hair and striking green-brown eyes. Coralyn has an athletic build and is very fast and agile. She began practicing the magic of the forest at a young age.
  
  
Long ago, even before The First Era, The Bosmer are commonly believed to have had constantly changing forms known as "Changelings" during the Dawn Era, and were eventually taught to maintain one shape by Y'ffre (the forest God) under the terms of the Green Pact. Therefor, it was thought that the ability to change form into an animal was lost to all Bosmer. At some point in the past, Coralyn’s parents offended the Daedric Prince of Madness, Sheogorath, and he cursed their child, Coralyn, with the ability to change shape into a wolf as a joke (something the Mad God has been known to do quite often). As this ability is taboo to all Bosmer due to the terms of the Green Pact, Coralyn’s parents left Valenwood to keep her secret safe and protect her from persecution at the hands of her own people.

**Special Perks**
  
**Earth Spirit:** Coralyn Staggers 25% less and staggers her foes 25% more.
  
**Animal Friendship:** Coralyn is a friend to most animals and they will not attack her.
  
**Gift of Nature:**  Reduces incoming damage.
  
  
**Special Abilities**
  
Consider this information very high-level. We purposely want you to discover Coralyn's true abilities on your own.
  
  
**Call Wolf Pack -**  Coralyn can summon 4 wolf companions to aid her and the player in combat.
  
**Combat Healing** - She will heal the player during combat.
  
**Purity** - Coralyn will heal, cure poison, and cure disease after combat.
  
**Boons** - Coralyn will buff the party at the start of combat.
  
**Stealthy** - Coralyn will stealth and muffle herself and the player if the player enters stealth mode.[/font]

Coralyn is extremely powerful at low levels. She balances out perfectly from mid-to-high levels. If you find her too strong in the early game, simply use the MCM and turn off some of her abilities.

* [font=Verdana]Follow distance:  You can make her follow at a normal range or a close behind.[/font]
[font=Verdana][/font][font=Verdana]FaceLight:  Coralyn comes with her own FaceLight. Enable it in the MCM.  Do not use another mod's FaceLight on Coralyn as it will double the brightness.[/font]
  
* [font=Verdana][/font][font=Verdana]Home Settings:  You can tell Coralyn where to live.  Once you've done that, you can add details by telling her where to sleep, eat breakfast, eat dinner, hang out in the morning and hang out in the afternoon. The secondary options are absolutely optional.  If all you do is tell her well to live, that's where she will live.[/font]
[font=Verdana][/font][font=Verdana]The Home Settings options are based around the players feet. So stand next to the bed where you want her to sleep.  Stand next to the table/chair where you want her to eat, etc.[/font]
  
* [font=Verdana][/font][font=Verdana]Where she eats and hangs out does not have to be in the same building as where she lives. She could live and sleep in Breezehome, visit the market in the morning, visit DragonsReach in the Afternoon, Eat Breakfast at the Drunken Huntsman and eat dinner at the Bannered Mare. You decide.[/font]
[font=Verdana][/font][font=Verdana]Coralyn doesn't need a mount. When you mount, Coralyn will shapechange into a wolf and follow you.[/font]

[font=Verdana]As mentioned in the comment policy, support is limited on this mod page and the comments section. Please use the Articles Tab Guides first, then head on over to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/JrpPh6F2tu) if you still have problems. These mods change looks only, and have been highly tested before release.  Placed properly in the load order, they work as expected. Most issues can be resolved by load order adjustment, re-downloading either the asset pack, mod or both, or by creating a custom patch.

**FAQ (from migal130)**
  
  
**Q: How can I marry Coralyn?**
  
  
There are two methods, depending on what else is installed.
  
  
1.  If Coralyn is installed without OPrivacy, it's fairly simple.
  
  A:  Enable Coralyn's shapeshifting in the MCM.
  
  B:  Get a horse.
  
  C:  Ask Coralyn to follow.
  
  D:  Mount the horse while Coralyn is following.
  
  E:  This opens up dialogue options to ask her about being a wolf.
  
  F:  Complete the dialogue sequence.
  
  G:  Approximately 48 hours later, the marriage dialogues appear.
  
  
2.  With OPrivacy installed.
  
   A: Follow steps A-F above.
  
   B:  There is no 48 hour timer.
  
   C:  Take Coralyn to fight with you in dungeons.
  
   D:  Loot bodies and chests until she asks for your help.
  
   E:  Help Coralyn with her problem.
  
   F:  Marriage dialogues will open up.
  
  
**Q:  Why does Coralyn say "no" when I ask for privacy with her?**
  
A:  Your relationship isn't high enough yet.  Or, you haven't asked her about being a wolf yet.  Or, you married Coralyn and cheated on her.
  
  
**Q:  How does Coralyn know I cheated?**
  
A:  She warns you about it when discussing marriage.  She tells you the ceremony will allow her to feel what you feel no matter where you are.
  
  
**Q:  Is it cheating if I have a threesome with Coralyn?**
  
A:  No.
  
  
**Q: Can Coralyn approach in OPrivacy?**
  
A: Yes. Both regular and follower approach. In fact, you can't marry her until she has approached you in a dungeon. You can't even ask her for privacy until she's done it.
  
  
**Q: Can Coralyn catfight?**
  
A: Yes. But, she cannot be rejected by another catfighting follower if she approaches.
  
  
**Q: What is the ideal load order for all these mods?A: Something like this:**
  
  
OpenSex has no plugin
  
BBLuxurSuite.esm (as a master it loads high no matter what)
  
OStim.esp
  
OPrivacy.esp (within first 255 minimum)
  
BBLuxurySuiteENM.esp (after mods that mess with BBLS exterior cell)
  
CS\_Vayne.esp
  
CS\_Coralyn.esp
  
NaughtyVoices.esp (this can really be anywhere)
  
OP\_Vayne\_Patch.esp
  
OP\_Coralyn\_Patch.esp
  
BBLS\_SKSE64\_Patch.esp
  
BBLS\_ColdSun\_Patch.esp
  
  
**Q: Coralyn refuses when I ask her to follow. She also always says no when I ask for privacy. She won't warm a bed for me in BBLS. WTF?**
  
A: You married Coralyn and then cheated on her.
  
  
**Q: I cheated on Coralyn. How do I make up with her?**
  
A: I devised a simple, Chad-friendly system. From "may we speak a moment," select, "I'm sorry I cheated, Coralyn." She will accept your apology and then ask you for make-up sex.
