This mod allows for followers to die (killed by other NPCs) and there's also a chance they get injuries resulting from battles. As per version 3.0 (August 2023 update), this is what happens when your followers' health reaches 0:
  
  
  

  
* **Follower is fine (mini injury).**
    
   ﻿→  80% chance.  They get a small debuff for a couple of minutes.

  
* **Follower gets a serious injury.**
    
   → 15% chance. They're injured for a number of days, which decreases their stats. They get a bandage in their head (or in their arms if it's a khajiit/argonian race) and the system notifies you of their injury. You should consider sending your follower home to heal as otherwise their stats will be quite low and they will be more likely to fall in battle (and possibly die). -

  
* **Follower dies.**
    
   ﻿→ 5% chance. May their soul go to Sovngarde. Your follower has suffered an injury they could not recover from.      ‎

**~COMPATIBILITY~**[left]As of version 3.0, this mod is handled via SPID, meaning no edits to vanilla records. Should be compatible with everything.[/left]
  
  
**~FAQ~****How can I know how much time is left until the follower heals?**The game will let you know once they get injured and once they get healed. However, you can also check at any point by speaking with your follower.
  
  
**My follower is dead and now I regret it, oh no!**You can use the cheat codes in the MCM to resurrect a dead follower and also to remove all injuries from any wounded follower.
  
  
**You monster, why do you want followers to die!**→ I love story-telling and creating my own narratives when I'm playing Skyrim. Having a follower die on you can be a turning point in the story of your character. In vanilla, leaving a follower behind and running for your life has no consequences, as you know they will be fine. Now, you will have to wonder if you've left your follower to their death, or if they manage to sneak out somehow and come back to you. Having actual stakes when playing with followers is something I really wished to have, but simply marking followers "non-protected" is just unfair to the player, as we know most followers fall to their knees every second fight they're in. I think this is a good balance where you'll actually have to actively protect your followers.
  
  
**Why can't Serana and certain other followers die?**NPCs that are critical to the game cannot die, but will receive permanent injuries instead. Permanent injuries are applied once the follower should've died but they didn't because I don't want to break your game. Permanent injuries allows the follower to continue coming along with you, but they will not fight with you during combat.
  
  
**Are all followers automatically detected by your mod?**Yes, most of them. However... If a follower is not added to the currentfollower faction by its mod, then they will not be automatically detected. Most modded followers use the faction correctly, but not all. If you encounter a modded follower that is not affected by my mod, you can add them to the system via the MCM (inside the game) or by adding them to the formlist of my mod (using xEdit outside the game).
