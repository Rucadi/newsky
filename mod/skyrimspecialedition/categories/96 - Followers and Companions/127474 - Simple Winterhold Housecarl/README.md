Winterhold is the only hold you can't get a housecarl for by being Thane, I decided to change this.
  
  
I wanted to add the full hearthfire / build your own house system that the other open holds use but that was way beyond my current skill level of modding so I settled for doing this.
  
  
Eorik, the added housecarl uses the same voice type as Argis the Bulwark, I used it because it seemed to be the most rare housecarl voice type, unfortunately this voice type doesn't steward dialogue though.
  
  
the malenord voice that both potential jarls of winterhold have doesn't have the line "I grant you a personal Housecarl, and this weapon from my armory to serve as your badge of office." but I perfectly spliced this from the line "I grant you a personal Housecarl to watch over your home and this weapon from my armory to serve as your badge of office." (was easy just removing part of the line)
  
  
Compatibilty:
  
  
This mod should be compatible with everything it only makes an edit to one piece of dialogue in the game and spawns the housecarl through a script attached to that dialogue instead of by editing the quest it's apart of (so should be compatible with anything that doesn't edit that piece of dialogue)
  
  
Update Changelog:
  
1.1 accidentally left some packages of the character he was built on top of in his AI so just removed those from him in the update.
  
  
1.2 Added a dismissal line similiar to the hearthfire housecarls use prior to building the hearthfire houses "I'll be waiting for you at the Jarl's Longhouse in Winterhold if you need me, Thane."
