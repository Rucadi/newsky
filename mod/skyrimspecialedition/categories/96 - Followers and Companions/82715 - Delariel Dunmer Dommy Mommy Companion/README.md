Seductive and deadly, the mysterious Delariel is both a powerful mage as well as skilled with a blade.
  
Little known about Delariel, beside that she spends most of her time alone, learning and researching magic by herself.
  
Recently she stays at The Frozen Hearth inn, looking for a way to gain access to the College of Winterhold to improve her study of magic,
  
but the college members keep looking at her in a suspicious way because of her unorthordox method in studying magic.... and outfit.
  
  
She is both a friend and rival of [Valariel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/images/173092) - a powerful mage who will soon join the Blue Palace. 
  
As a Milfactory custom follower, she requires the[Milfactory Asset Hub 1.2 or newer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80819) to work.
  
  
  
Some additional info:
  
  

  
* Her weakness is a bad eyesight, she has to wear an optic device made from
    
  dwemer metal and crystal made by a friend. Totally not a pair of glasses....
She is essential.
  
* She is marriageable
She has 100 weight.
  
* She is specialized in magic, and can use conjuration, destruction, restoration and alteration up to adept level.
She is skilled in one handed, and will use a bound sword in combat,
  
and an elven dagger as a last resort weapon when out of magicka.* She is at The Frozen Hearth Inn - Winterhold.
All screenshots were taken on BHUNP version.
  
* Her outfit are from vanilla assets, if you have mod to alternate them, she will have whatever you installed.
The tavern dress she is wearing is from [minidress collection BHUNP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35080)﻿
  
* This mod is compatible with both BHUNP and 3BA version of the [Asset Hub](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80819)﻿.
Be nice to her.
