* Head over to the Winking Skeever. **Katana**'s upstairs, probably eating.
Katana has an [affinity system](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/5607)﻿, which is why she isn't initially the warmest.
  
* First time playing the mod? To start, choose: "So, what brings you to Skyrim?"
Chasing the Current is skippable (version 3.0+), provided you pass Katana's test.
  
* **Megara** is recruitable at the Drunken Huntsman after Chasing the Current, or if you pass Katana's test to skip to her.
**Shale** is recruitable after finishing The Ravens' Lament, at the Bee and Barb, or if you pass Katana's test to skip all the mod's quests.
  
* **APPEARANCE: The Raven Replacer available as an optional download. A more realistic touch for Katana, Megara, and River.**

* **Non-intrusive companionship system with a focus on immersion**.
This mod has features in place to reduce repetition. Dialogue is created with the intent to complement your choices in the game. On that note, the mod's companions may not agree with all your choices, but they will not change the outcome of quests or instigate any fights on their own. They also refrain from long monologues. Most idles are short, and there is a no-chatter-overlap system in place, reducing the chance of Katana, Megara, or Shale speaking over each other or conversations between the player and **select characters**.
  
* The mod contains quiet packages for certain scenes (see **Quests** below) so you can hear other NPCs speak.
This mod does not refer to you as the Dragonborn, at all. Have fun, role-players.
  
* None are marriage candidates, but Shale might be interested.
All three level with the player (they start at level 10, then they follow your level).
  
* All are set to essential and cannot die.
All have a gift system and can be hugged.
  
* All can cook for you (yay, Requiem players).
All have the standard companion features (relax, trade, dismiss, etc.)
  
* All heal themselves upon bleeding out.
All can hold back in combat (until attacked) if you ask.
  
* Katana & Megara have CBBE curvy by default (not nude). The body mods you have installed will not change their body type.
All have a unique mount.
  
* All can live in any interior (to consider modded homes).
All have follow distance options (quiet packages override this).
  
* All have a summon and debug spell, which can only be used while they are recruited.
Each has a unique tracker item, so you can see them on your map.
  
* You are welcome to delete the OAR folders (if you're on VR, you might have to; not 100% sure).
**If you have certain mods where bleedout/defeat is involved, you may need to add this mod as an exception.**
  
* **Please do not add any of them to other follower frameworks. They have their own**.
**INCOMPATIBLE-ish: [Open Cities](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/87707). You won't be able to enjoy the mod if you have this installed UNLESS you take Katana's quiz to skip all quests entirely.**
  
* **If using [Swiftly Order Squad](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63259), they do wait and stop waiting, but many lines rely on the built-in wait/stop-wait system ("Take it easy here for now?"). That mod is best used with this mod when you're in a rush. But if you're playing the story or using their other features, please use their built-in system. Note: That mod's teleport system works with our companions even though we have a built-in method to teleport them**.

* Specializes in One-Handed, Two-Handed, Light Armor, Sneak, Block, Lockpicking, and Archery (has a rifle - **grab the No Rifle patch if this bothers you**).
Strategically teleports and uses invisibility in combat.
  
* Has an [affinity system](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/5607).

**Features unlocked after Chasing the Current/skipping it:**
  

  
* Summons a shade to assist in combat when nearing bleedout. *It's supposed to go away automatically, but if it's roaming around Skyrim with you, you can activate it to dismiss it.*
Can pick locks for you (in select places).
  
* Can do her own bounties (can take from 4 hours to 3 days) and might bring you some goodies when she returns.
Scouts dangerous areas if asked. If she thinks an area is clear, she'll stay with you.
  
* Becomes more comfortable around the player and opens up a lot more.
Shadow Mode: **YOU** can go invisible and have movement muffled, if you ask (plus Megara, Shale, and three extra followers).
  
* If Shadow Mode is enabled, Katana, Megara, and Shale won't initiate combat.
Need words of wisdom? Katana's here for you (choose **Thoughts?**).

* Specializes in Restoration, One-Handed, and Light Armor.
Heals party members individually, including vampires.
  
* Cures diseases in exchange for garlic.
[Wounds](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17581) patch available: Megara can cure your wounds in exchange for tundra cotton.
  
* Offers a potion-buff system (the buff of your choice applies when combat begins); [read for more information](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/5608)﻿.
Offers radiant bounty quests.
  
* If holding a torch, she puts it away when sneaking.
She picks up ingredients, which is off by default. Depending on your modlist, you may or may not see ingredients in her inventory.
  
* Need a laugh? Megara's got your back (choose **Thoughts?**).

* Specializes in One-handed, Block, Destruction, and Light Armor.
Taunts enemies when you are at 40% health, with a 60s cooldown. You can turn this feature off.

The only companion in the mod who will entertain you if you tell him you like him.
