A self-appointed title as Igra does not belong to any knightly order.
  
However, she seeks to gain acclaim by questing, rescuing, drinking ales and generally performing various acts of gallantry.
  
Eventually, she *will* found her own order under the banner of the Hammer... However long that may take.
  
  
Where equipment is concerned, Igra is more than a bonafide knight.
  
Her finely crafted armour is more than a match for that of the average errant knight,
  
 coated in quicksilver and impervious to slashing attacks.
  
  
In her arsenal, she wields the Gunhammer, a curious weapon whose mechanics only she seems to understand...
  
Allows her to blast foes from the the metal head of this weapon... what purpose this serves is a mystery.
  
  
**Location:**
  
You will find her in Solitude provided you have completed the quest "Dragon Rising", otherwise can be found in Old Hroldan.
  
During weekends she will visit her clan in Dushnikh Yal where you can find a second set of her armour and hammer.
  
  
**Stats:**Lvl 5 - 150.
  
Melee.
  
Espfe.
