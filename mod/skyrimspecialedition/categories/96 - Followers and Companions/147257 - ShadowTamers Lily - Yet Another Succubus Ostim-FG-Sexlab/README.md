**[VOICE SAMPLE](https://youtu.be/o4xfKfO1MXk)﻿
  
[size=4][color=#c9daf8][b]Lily left Oblivion for one reason: boredom. She had everything, worship, power, indulgence and none
  
 of it felt worth staying for. Your soul felt different. So now she’s
  
here. Following you. Watching you. Occasionally saving your life like
  
it’s a favor you didn’t ask for.
  
She’s not here to help. She’s not here to love. But you’ll probably think she is.
  
Lily flirts like she’s obsessed. Clings like you matter. Sleeps close,
  
touches often, praises without hesitation. It feels intimate, until it
  
doesn’t. Because she doesn’t clarify. She doesn’t commit. She just wants
  
 the high.
  
She fights like she’s invincible, complains like she’s inconvenienced, and loves being looked at. A heavy armor tank with the
  
emotional logic of a hot girl in the middle of a situationship.
  
You’re not dating. You’re not safe.
  
You’re just what she’s into right now.**

[color=#c9daf8][b]I wrote Lily based on those love bombing relationships where she gives you everything except
  
clarification. I thought it was a fun dynamic. Thanks to my Marvel
  
Rivals duo for letting me use her voice as the base template. If you
  
enjoyed [Cubbi](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/143163)﻿ you will likely enjoy Lily. They are sisters and banter planned for a much later date.
  
  
She has** [size=5]**no requirements besides** **either SL or OStim as far as followers go, but there are MANY mods that I use that I base my lines on and for gameplay.
  
  
I like a certain type of make up styles, I tried to be varied but alas I am just a man. Either way she still has** ***1152*** **possible outcomes depending on your choice's in her fomod.
  
2 Lip size options
  
Horn or no Horn
  
6 Hairstyles
  
8 make up
  
6 Eyes
  
  
She can be found near the black door near Falkreath outside Dark Brotherhood Sanctuary
  
  
She will overtime naturally have more dialogue options. Once used she will
  
start approaching you for fun time randomly and will also let you
  
initiate fun time.
  
  
You can simply use her as a generic follower or use her as intended with the voice, do not merge her body and voice
  
they are two separate mods I do this on purpose. If you don't use her
  
voice she won't get her two handed and heavy armor perks. If you do use
  
her without the voice then she will be a husk follower you'll need
  
something like NFF to have a vanilla follower.

**FAQ
  
  
[b][size=3]If you tell Lily to dance it will trigger 48 lines that loop randomly every 5-10 seconds. It wont stop until you talk to her again**
  
[/size]
  
 ESL?: Unfortunately not
  
  
There are lines that will activate if you are a female player but this is mostly meant for Futa players. Cubbi my original mod has have a [female player version available](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/149637)﻿.
  
  
SHE USES YOUR SKIN AND YOUR BODY - This means if you have Vanilla skins and Body she will not look anything like my pictures.
  
  
I use Rudy for Obsidian weathers ENB
  
BHUNPV4
  
BNP Skin 2.0 4k
  
**[b]*You do need* a sex framework installed for Lily to lovebomb you, Use this if you have Ostim download
  
"ShadowmanNPCs FOMOD"
  
[Ostim Patch by SimonPhil](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73853?tab=files)**
  
***Compatibility**
  
Compatible with NFF. Other follower frameworks not tested. In NFF, she performs best when assigned as a tank or two-handed DPS.* [/b]
  
**I hate AI it took our jobzz: Only download the main file listed follower then enjoy vanilla voice :)**
  
  
CONFLICTS WITH SHADOWMANS NPC'S OR HIS MODS: These are not real conflicts, Shadowman created the scripts for Lily
  
and are the same as many of his other mods so you probably have those
  
installed. Just load her files last its fine.[/b]

  

**Game version: I use 1.6.640 and 1.6.1170 although should work in any version. Try BEES if you have a issue.**
