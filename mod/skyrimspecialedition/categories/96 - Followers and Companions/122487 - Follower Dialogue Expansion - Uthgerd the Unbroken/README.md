This mod is part of my series to renovate vanilla characters with additional depth, unique history or personality, and immersive and detailed interaction.
  
  
  
*"My anger doesn't need to be contained. It's my weapon, greater than any fist or sword. Take that away... then I would truly be the girl they thought I was."*
  
  
  
**How is Uthgerd envisioned and touched on in this mod:**
  
  
In this mod, Uthgerd is expanded as a **strong, aggressive warrior** who is extremely defensive due to a **childhood where she was constantly bullied.** She believes this is a world where you have to **kill in order to not be killed, and peace is a lie for the meek.**As a child, Uthgerd was a sickly girl who couldn’t defend herself, making her an easy target for the urchins of Whiterun. The humiliation and abuse she endured taught her that the world has no mercy for the weak. Determined to survive, she vowed to become strong enough to defeat anyone who might harm her.
  
  
She eventually became a strong warrior under Vignar Gray-Mane's guidance and had her revenge. However, her hope of joining the Companions was shattered when she accidentally killed her opponent during her trial. This incident fueled her bitter grudge against the Companions, whom she now sees as no different from the bullies of her past.
  
  
**Can you help reconcile her and the Companions? And will you use her anger as a weapon or try to soothe it?**In this mod, Uthgerd has a **stoic, vengeful and cynical demeanor,** but she is also **fiercely loyal to you** as your follower. In battle, she is a powerful warrior specialized in heavy armor and two-handed weapons.
