**FAQ:** **Where do I find Khash? What if I lose her?**
  
 **She is located in the Sleeping Giant Inn in Riverwood. You can find Khash also by using an npc tracker mod, or using her RefID (07005900) with the Player.PlaceAtMe console command.**
  
  
 **I can’t talk to her when first meeting Khash.**
  
 **Quick Save and reload your game. This usually happens on new games that have yet to be reloaded.**
  
  
 **﻿Khash is in her underwear (Beggar clothes.)**
  
 **You probably gave her a piece of armor or clothing that is better than anything else in her inventory and she doesn’t have a mesh for it. This is because her body type isn’t compatible with the clothing or armor. If you want a more lore-friendly explanation… hm… the clothes were only adult size.**
  
  
 **Should I feel bad about being a kid with me on my adventures?**
  
 **She is going to adventure either way.**
  
  
 **Khash won't follow me towards the end of the Mages questline.**
  
**Go talk to her. There's a dialogue prompt that says "Come on. Let's go." There's a reason she's not following you.**
  
  
 **﻿Why are the backstory phases lay-outed the way they are?**
  
 **I wanted to let you have more control over how fast you get through her backstory. So you can choose to go through all the phases in one go, or you can choose to take breaks between each phase. It’s all up to you.**
  
  
 **Why does Khash (Enter character trait here)?**
  
 **That’s just how she is. There is a reason for every trait she has, including her fears, likes, dislikes, speech pattern, idles, ect.**
  
  
 **Can I adopt her?**
  
 **At the moment, no. Though, don’t be surprised if it comes up in future updates.**
  
  
 **I have an idea for Khash.**
  
 **Please, send me a message and let me know. I would love to hear it!**
  
  
 **Can I make (insert mod patch) for Khash?**
  
 **Send me a message about what type of patch you want to do. If it’s something like an appearance patch or translation mod, I’m more than happy to let you do that. But I’m new to modding and don’t know what types of patches could be made for a follower. Still, I would love to know if you’re making something for her.**
  
  
 **﻿Who is Khash's voice actor?**
  
 **﻿ ﻿I'm actually the one who voiced Khash. And yes, it hurt a lot.**
  
  
 **﻿Khash lips won't move (On XBOX)**
  
 **﻿ ﻿This is a bug with the game as far as I can figure out. This happens when there are too many actors in a scene or area. I don't think this is something I can fix. Sorry for the inconvenience.**
