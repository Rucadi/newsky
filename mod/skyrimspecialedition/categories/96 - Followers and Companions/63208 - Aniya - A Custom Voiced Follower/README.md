"I wanted to play Skyrim with my wife, so I tried putting her in the game... then I got carried away and made Aniya." ~ Kenerad﻿
  
  
Aniya - A Custom Voiced Follower is a companion/quest mod. Aniya, located in The Bannered Mare, is a charming Nord mage student who is morally gray- opting to steal sometimes but never kill. She is stuck in Skyrim for unknown reasons, and it's up to you to help get her a sweetroll and beginning your adventure together.
  
  
Aniya has various functions to use such as a relax function, outfit manager, player combat faction manager, Aniya map tracker, home framework, sweetroll bakery framework, detailed romance system and more. She currently has one introduction quest exploring her initial background, and a fully detailed romance quest system revolving around your romantic journey with her (multiple quests involved in this!). She has over 3,900 lines currently (3,100 being Aniyas alone, 800 supporting NPCs), giving you plenty of lines tailored to unique scenarios, many unexpected! Some may trigger an optional task for you or a unique encounter from past conjuration mistakes Aniya may have mentioned before! 
  
  
Aniya is planned to have a lot more content than you are currently seeing. She will have a main story, spell learning, content for each faction, combat tweaks, NPC encounters, follower relationships that grow, random scenes, misc tasks, 8000 + lines to be added and so much more!

﻿**INCLUDED IN THIS MOD:**
  
  
**The Intro Quest:**The Intro quest starts off in the Bannered Mare with a scene, after which you will be greeted by Aniya, asked to do a simple task, choose a player faction from her (which can be changed later), and learn of her background and personality.
  
  
**The Dialogue:**With 3,900+ lines of dialogue (3,100+ for Aniya) each one is uniquely crafted to fit situations, moods, stories, events, player attitudes, past events, romance level/rank and role play! Her dialogue will largely depend on the circumstances, quests, weather, enemies, location, and romance. Aniya will always say certain lines of dialogue to better fit the world she inhabits, making her an immersive experience for you on your adventures.
  
  
**The Romance:**Aniya's romance system is quite detailed. Romance is started by completing intro favors to win her heart. She will later confess her feelings and begin the rest of the romance. You will be able to talk to her about romance, go on dates with her (outings/courts as she puts it), hear romantic/friendship dialogue all while growing your romance level and rank until you feel ready to propose marriage to her. Wedding time! The wedding quest is more than just a ceremony, you have to prepare! This quest includes over 5 custom NPCs! After the wedding and moving into a home, a sweetroll bakery quest and system is included in the romance that will keep Aniya busy when you need go on an Adventure alone or with friends. Not only will she run a bakery (after marriage) but she also has LOTS of home content! Children interactions, conversations about your adventures, and so much more!

  
  
**Romance update guide:**  

Spoiler
  
[center]To start romance you need to get Aniya's romance level to 5 by doing some of the romance intro favors.

  
[left]

* **Give 6 sweetrolls:**Adds +1 romance on the 6th sweetroll. Must give one every 2 hours or more, can not spam to increase romance**.**
    
  **Give 3 compliments:** Adds +1 romance after 3 compliments given, (new topic choice under let's talk section), can only give 1 compliment every 24 hours.
**Finish Dragonrising quest:** Adds +3 romance when the dragon is slain, also introduces the dragonborn name function. Talk to her to initiate this.
  
* **Finish golden claw quest:** Adds +2 romance after quest is completed. Talk to her to initiate this.
**Defend Aniya against the Shady Nord:** Adds +3 romance. Once your romance level is 3 or higher, go to the entrance by the rat way, a Shady Nord will try to "pay" Aniya for "services". Aniya will take offence to this and a scene will commence. Help her after this encounter.
  
* **Defend Aniya from Mikael's advances:** Adds +3 romance. Go to the banneredmare between 5pm and 9pm, if your romance level is 3 or higher, a scene will start between them. Confront Mikael, make him stop, any means possible.

[/left]

After reaching romance level 5 Aniya will confess feelings for you. You can accept or deny these. If denied you can change your mind later, however if accepted you'll officially start the romance with Aniya. This unlocks two new topics under "let's talk, a home setting feature and an "about romance" section. Under the "about romance" topic you can get a status update on your relationship, initiate dates, and change your relationship status. To progress the romance further you will need to either continue doing the intro favors that are repeatable AND do the available dates. All dates are repeatable. Dates 1 and 2 are available at the start of romance (when dating as friends and on) and date 3 becomes available when you are partners AND are a high enough romance level. The purpose of date 3 is a proposal/repeatable date. I won't say how to marry her (takes away the fun of finding out naturally) but there's dialogue on how to marry her in the "about romance" topic. Marriage is simple, once started follow the quest as normal. Once married all post-marriage content will become available (extra lines, some certain topics from being home, etc, and most importantly the sweetroll bakery.)

  

To start the sweetroll bakery you must be married, have set a home with Aniya, your home must have an oven AND/OR a cooking pot and wait one week after the wedding is completed. After this talk to Aniya and the introduction quest to the bakery will start. From here follow the quest as normal and so begins the bakery after the quest is completed. You can talk to Aniya about the bakery, ask her status, trade and get profits. Every time you enroll her, the bakery will stop, so once she is dismissed back home, if you want her to run the bakery you will need to ask her to start it up again.

  

If you have any questions, read the FAQ or ask on the discord server or nexus.

**The Functions/Systems (Post v0.5):**

  
[left]* ***A "relax/hang out here function":** to help your roleplay needs to chill at a camp, town, inn whatever you want she'll chill out and you'll never lose her if you run off. C[i]an be used when talking with Aniya in the let's talk section, or stopped in the first dialogue options.*[/i]
***A "follow closer/farther function":** to make Aniya change how closely she follows you so you can have space or no space between her and you. C[i]an be changed upon talking with Aniya in the let's talk section.*[/i]
  
* ***A "Aniya needs a sweetroll function":**That does exactly what it sounds like, give Aniya a sweetroll if she ever asks for one and she will sometimes!*
***A "Where Are You, Aniya? function":** Is a quest that helps track Aniya in the unlikely event that you lose her.*
  
* ***A "change Outfit function":** Is a function where if you have a certain set of clothes, Aniya will take them and wear them. She will also wear outfits she already has and also allows you to give her anything to wear (a removing base outfit entirely to wear anything). C[i]an be changed upon talking with Aniya in the let's talk section.*[/i]
    
  [/left]
***A "change faction function":** Not to be confused with vanilla factions, during the intro quest you choose between 4 factions, which if you choose to switch at a later date, can be changed upon talking with Aniya in the let's talk section.*
  
* **﻿*****A "set home function":*** As it states, used to set Aniya's home. Works with all vanilla, and most modded homes, as long as they use the correct player home keywords.
**A "sweetroll bakery system (only after marriage)":** A bakery system that starts after her bakery intro quest is done. She will bake 5 days a week, sell on loredas and buy supplies if needed from a supplier on sundas. Has her own packages, dialogue and interactions around this. This is a great way for Aniya to generate passive income while you're out adventuring and she's at home. Works with any home that has an oven or cooking pot.
  
* **A "romance rank check function":** As it states, checks the romance rank and romance level giving you an immersive response to how things are going in your relationship. Rank can be asked about in dialogue. (located under let's talk).
***A "breakup quest/system":***Relationship troubles? Tired of dating Aniya and want to romance your other follower? Well, you can break up, but she will leave your service for a while and wander the inns of Skyrim. If you want a second shot with Aniya, try to find her somewhere.
  
* ***A "healing system":***As it states, Aniya will now heal in combat using health potions you give her. This is toggle on and off now.
***A "home check-up system":*** A system for checking on the player when talking to Aniya when she's dismissed at your set home. She will ask you about your day, ask to adventure with you, help you if you're sick, and much more.
  
* ***A "Dragonborn naming system":*** Just became Dragonborn in the main story? Aniya reacts to that (differently if it was on or off camera). Now she gives you the option to address you with your new title if you would prefer (can be toggled on or off).
**A "*Custom Ghost Event System*":** Does just what it says. A custom ghost will occasionally show up to follow Aniya after midnight in the woods around the Rift or the marshes of Morthal. Careful though, he's quite shy and is hard to catch following her! Maybe you should ask her about the ghost?

**FAQ**

  

  
* **Do I need a new save? -**DEPENDS! If you're coming from version 0.5, no, but if you are going from version 0.2.2 to 0.5.5, yes.
**Where can I find her?** **-** In the Banneredmare.
  
* **Does she comment on quests? -** Yes! Currently she has full awareness for the following quests: The Mind of Madness, Laid to Rest, Lifting The Shroud, Headless Horseman and Delayed Burial. She has partial awareness for Dragon Rising and The Golden Claw.
**Can I give her sweet rolls? -** Yes, yes you can, she loves them!
  
* **HELP! I can't give her sweetrolls! -** Check you're inventory for one, if you got one and it still doesn't show up, check if you got sweetroll replacers in your LO. It works, you just have to fix your LO if that's the case.
**HELP! I can't find VALENTUS! -** Please update Aniya to 0.5.5 and reload BEFORE you talk to Aniya about wedding plans. It works, just not if you borked your save on a previous version.
  
* **HELP! I can't activate the altar with purple flowers on the wedding quest! -** Disable survival mode for a moment, reload a previous save and try again. Still trying to patch this.
**HELP! She isn't talking to Hulda or me! -** Please check you're LO. If you're running an older version of Skyrim, use BEES. She works, it's just a Skyrim modding thing.
  
* **HELP! She isn't working at all! [insert bug] -** Please check you're LO for any conflicts first before reporting bugs to me. If you need pointers thats fine. Being a mod author I hardly have the time to fix my own LO , I doubt I'll have time to fix other peoples LOs, plus, I'm trash at it, ask my friends.
**Can I teach her spells? -** No not yet, she will get a spell-learning system with mages guild update v0.6
  
* **Can I marry her?! -**Yes! Yes you can!
**What patches are included? -** Four patches are included. First is a patch the vanilla body patcher (allows you to use your own body and skin mods on Aniya), second is a Standalone High Poly Head Replacer for Aniya, third is the same High Poly Head Replacer but a Vanilla Body Patch version (also always you to use any skin and body mod on her.), lastly the final patch is an immersive sweetroll experience (needs a new game for this).
  
* **Does she have any follower interactions? -**None at the moment, but she will have interactions with Lucifer (coming out on his update 1.0), Malryn, Val Serano, Daegon, Secunda, Bowen, Isadore, and Spike.
**Will she have a Bruma patch? -** She will! It's planned but it will have to wait until I consider her feature complete (v1.0).
  

  
**﻿COMPATIBILITY**

﻿Aniya is compatible with almost every mod, however there are a few that will undoublty have bad effects. Here is a list of known compatibility issues and if patches are available for them.

  

  
* **﻿Follower Framework mods such as AFT, NFF and the like -**Any mod that touches her packages will werck havoc on my custom quests. **NO PATCH AVAILABLE. DO NOT USE THESE MODS WITH ANIYA!**
**Home framework mods that import followers, like MHIYH -** These will not work on Aniya! **DO NOT IMPORT AND USE THESE ON HER! SHE HAS HER OWN HOME FRAMEWORK!** Her home framework is only available after becoming friends! (under the "let's talk" topic, works with any home, even modded.)
  
* **Immersive Citizens -** I've had issues with this mod testing various scenes with vanilla NPCs, as well as its causing Aniya's dialogue to sometimes disappear for some users. Best to avoid this mod when using Aniya until a patch is made.
**Open cities -** DO NOT use this mod with Aniya, her quests break. She needs a patch for this.
  
* **City overhaul mods, like jk's skyrim series, cities of the north, etc -**These alter interiors/exteriors so some parts of Aniya and other supporting NPCs may use assets behind or inside walls/objects. Any bug related to this will need a patch.
