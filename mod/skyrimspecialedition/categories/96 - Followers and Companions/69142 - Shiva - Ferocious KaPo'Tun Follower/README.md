**[font=Arial]DESCRIPTION:[/font]**
  
  
[font=Tahoma]**Shiva** is a custom ESL'ified/ESPFE Ka Po' Tun follower mod that uses mainly [CBBE/3BA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30174)﻿﻿ and [Kapo'tun SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40928) meshes and textures, whose assets are provided by other mod authors. Massive credits to DracoWarrior729 who is the original creator of the Kapo'tun race mod. Without their mod my follower mod obviously wouldn't even be possible. I upscaled most of the KaPo'Tun textures and made improvements to the hand/feet seams (though note that they aren't perfect) for a 3BA body. Also included are four different hair options, three face paint options, and three tail resize/reposition options to choose from.[/font]
  
  
**[font=Arial]SHIVA:[/font]**
  
  

  
* [font=Tahoma]*DUAL-WIELDING WARRIOR* | Shiva dual-wields her own personal katanas and valiantly fights on the front-line. [/font]
[font=Tahoma][font=Tahoma]*FEROCIOUS ROAR* | Shiva [/font]is able to use her powerful tiger roar in combat, capable of staggering foes in place.[/font]
  

  
* [font=Tahoma]*SCALES WITH YOU* | She starts at lv. 6 and scales with the player.  [/font]
[font=Tahoma] *UNKILLABLE & MARRIAGEABLE* | Is flagged as essential, unique, and marriageable.[/font]
  
* [font=Tahoma] *SEVERAL PERKS* | Has several perks including Light Foot, Bladesman, and Dual Flurry.[/font]
[font=Tahoma] *UNIQUE INVENTORY* | Spawns in with her two unique katanas and dons the [TAWOBA Blades CBBE Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9547)﻿.[/font]
  
* [font=Tahoma] *TALLER & FASTER* | Height set to 1.05, Weight set to 100, Movement Speed set to 110.[/font]
[font=Tahoma] *STRONG VOICE* | She uses the voice of FemaleCondescending.[/font]

[font=Arial]**BODY:**[/font]
  
  

  
* [font=Tahoma] Currently, **Shiva** comes in only CBBE/3BA. There's no vanilla or BHUNP option and I probably won't be adding those in the future.[/font]
[font=Tahoma] Technically still works without installing CBBE/3BA since she's using the body meshes/textures that are from her own mod folder, but installing 3BA and it's dependencies is highly recommended so that everything works like it's supposed to.[/font]
  
* [font=Tahoma]**If you want to customize her body size**, you'll need to download [BodySlide and Outfit Studio](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/201)﻿ in order to access and change her clothed and unclothed body. Her BodySlide meshes are included for you to build.[/font]
[font=Tahoma] Optional, but I highly recommend my custom muscular 3BA preset that's available in my [font=Tahoma][Big Beastly Bodies](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71547)﻿ [/font]preset mod. The preset that I'm using for Shiva was originally for [Onasha-Maki](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68355)﻿, and is named Onasha-Maki Muscular. You can also get it from my Onasha-Maki mod if you so choose.[/font]
  
* [font=Tahoma] Alternatively, you could also look into [OBody](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51084)﻿, [AutoBody](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61321)﻿, or [Proteus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62934)﻿ to help ease your life a bit when it comes to customizing and diversifying NPC bodies.[/font]

  
[font=Arial]**SOFT REQUIREMENTS / RECOMMENDATIONS:**[/font]
  
[font=Tahoma]
  
While Shiva can work without any additional installments, if you want a fully-functional body I recommend downloading 3BA and its dependencies.
  
[/font]

  
* [font=Tahoma] [3BA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30174)﻿ (and it's dependencies) for a fully-functional body.[/font]
[font=Tahoma] [CBPC](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21224)﻿ and/or [SMP-HDT](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57339?tab=description)﻿ for body physics.[/font]
  
* [font=Tahoma] [BodySlide and Outfit Studio](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/201)﻿ to build her custom body and outfit.[/font]

[font=Tahoma]
  
 I highly recommend the following mods to use alongside mine:
  
[/font]

  
* [font=Tahoma] [KaPo'Tun SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40928) if you want to play as this race.[/font]
[font=Tahoma] [Relationship Dialogue Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1187/)﻿ to provide more dialogue.[/font]
  
* [font=Tahoma] [Nether's Follower Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55653)﻿ or other follower framework mod.[/font]
[font=Tahoma] [Ryan Reos Dark Elf Blader](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54994) and/or [COCO RONIN](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47462) to give her some nice alternative outfits.[/font]
  

  
[font=Arial]**INSTALLATION:**[/font]
  
[font=Tahoma]
  
[/font]

[font=Tahoma]Nothing fancy, just use your preferred mod manager tool to install. Don't forget to build your bodies with BodySlide. DON'T INSTALL WITHOUT A MOD MANAGER, THERE'S A FOMOD INCLUDED. Some mod managers may have issues with the FOMOD since each manager installs FOMODs slightly differently. If you're experiencing issues, try to download the non-FOMOD version in the Optional Files section.[/font]

  
[font=Arial]**LORE:**[/font]
  
  
[font=Tahoma]**Race Lore, from the KaPo'Tun Mod's description:**
  
*"The Ka Po' Tun are a race of (tiger-like) "cat-folk" who live in the continent of Akavir. It is unknown to what extent they are similar or related to the Khajiit. The Ka Po' Tun are one of four races who live in Akavir; the other races are the Kamal, Tang Mo, and Tsaesci. Although all of the races have fought each other at various times, the Ka Po' Tun consider the Tsaesci to be their greatest enemies. They have recently allied themselves with the Tang Mo."***Character Lore:**
  
*In recent times, several rumors of tiger-like humans have surfaced across the lands of Tamriel. In the rumors, It's been said that these felines have been known to have long sharp claws, as well as a powerful deafening roar that was capable of stopping foes in their tracks. Were they beast-folk or perhaps some rare breed of Khajiit? No one could say for certain. One such creature had been said to be spotted at **Snow Shod Farm**, near the Eastern gates of **Riften**. The intentions of this mysterious creature remain unclear, however its been said that it goes by the name, Shiva. For reasons unknown, Shiva had been reportedly spotted aiding the farmers during their most recent harvesting season and seemed to get along with people quite well. She had also been known to protect the farmlands from not only animals, but bandits as well. One such rumor claims that she had been asking the guards and townsfolk of Riften about a race known as the Ka Po' Tun, but very few seem to even recall hearing the name before.
  
  
Before fear and speculation get too out of hand, the Yarl of Riften tasked the Dragonborne to investigate matters regarding this tiger-like creature and report back their findings. The Dragonborne set out to Snow Shod Farm in search of answers.. unaware of their imminent discovery of an unfamiliar race, as well as a ferocious new ally.*[/font]
