**Description:**
  
Inspired by Aelarr's Race compatibility dialogue mod I decided to make a patch for [BluePwnsU's](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/6055366) wonderful Xelzaz - Custom Fully Voiced Argonian Telvanni Follower
  
  
Xelzaz has quite a few lines that you would miss playing as a custom/modded race. This patch allows you to hear one's appropriate for the modded race you are playing as.
  
 As long as your custom race has the "Actorproxy(race)" keyword, Xelzaz will treat your character as a member of that race.
  
  
**Example:** If the race has "Actorproxykhajiit" he will treat your character as a khajiit for example.
  
  
**Install:** Just download with your preferred mod manager and enable the esp. Or
  
download it manually and drop the esp in Skyrim SE's data folder. 
  
  
**Requirements:**
  

  
* [Race Compatibility](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2853) mod since it uses the keywords from that mod and every custom race mod requires it.

  
* [Xelzaz - Custom Fully Voiced Argonian Telvanni Follower](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62893)﻿

  
**Recommended:** Aelarr's [Race compatibility Dialogue](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17595) mod since it covers the base game and so so so many mods.
  
  
Please let me know if I missed a line or a line is not firing for the correct race.
