This mod is part of my series to renovate vanilla characters with additional depth, unique history or personality, and immersive and detailed interaction.
  
  
  
*"Contracts taken, targets slain; get paid in gold, then flush the blood with strong drinks. There are no questions, no grey areas."*
  
  
  
**How is Jenassa envisioned and touched on in this mod (MAIN VERSION):**
  
  
In this mod, Jenassa is expanded as a **seasoned mercenary whose life has been shaped by betrayal, loss, and exploitation.** The shadows of her past have turned her into a **cynical, cold killer with a morally grey worldview.** She will fight for you for a price - as her professionalism demands.
  
  
Jenassa's story begins with the brutal onslaught of the An-Xileel of Black Marsh, who raided her village and left her to survive on her own. A series of events eventually led her to Windhelm, where she met the artist she loved. From her, Jenassa learned to appreciate the beauty of life - but the prejudice of the Nords in Windhelm took Jenassa's lover from her. Driven by grief, Jenassa sought revenge and was imprisoned for her actions.
  
  
She was later freed, not by a benevolent savior, but by Imperial oligarchs who saw her as a tool to eliminate their enemies. Bound by their orders, Jenassa found herself trapped in a cycle of violence, **her trust in kindness shattered along with her dreams of freedom.**
  
  
Jenassa follows you out of contractual obligations, but will she ever come to respect you as a leader? **Can you help her make peace with her past and learn to trust again?**
  
  
You can hire her for 500 gold in Whiterun. As a follower, Jenassa is a skilled swordswoman and archer, capable of dealing significant damage to your enemies when equipped properly.
  
  
In the mod, Jenassa has a **cold, cynical demeanor,** but beneath her hardened exterior lies an appreciation for art and poetic expressions. For Jenassa, **rewards justify the journey, and she expects the same from you.**
