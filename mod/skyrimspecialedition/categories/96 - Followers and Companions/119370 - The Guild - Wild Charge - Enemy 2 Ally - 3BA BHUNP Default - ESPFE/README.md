Three Half-Orc sisters joined up with The Guild only a few months ago but in that time they've already built up a solid reputation. Many attribute their unusual upbringing to their success, as it is unusual for an Orc maiden to pair with a Dunmer warrior once, let alone on three separate occasions. Their father was strange for his kind but he was a legendary weapon master that passed his knowledge onto his beloved daughters before setting out again once they reached the age of majority. They each have harnessed his battle prowess in their own separate way but there is no doubt as to the path that lies before them. They seek to release the Empire from the clutches of the Aldmeri Dominion and restore the glory of the fallen. 
  
  
**What is this enemy to ally thing?**
  
  
All E2A followers come equipped with a very special feature. They no longer sit around waiting for you while clogging up valuable inn space. Instead, each follower is placed out in the world for you to discover and defeat. Only then will you be considered worthy of their time and have the ability to recruit them as a companion. 
  
  
**But where are they?**
  
  
That's for me to know and you to find out by traversing Skyrim and playing as you normally would. You're bound to run across them as they are not hidden. 
  
  
Note: If you really must cheat you can look at the included text document in the zip file for their possible locations. Yes. You read that right. Each follower has three possible locations where they might spawn.

**Issues**
  
  
If you have a neck seam please check first if you have a mod like Wet Function Redux active. This may be the culprit. 
  
  
It is a known issue that the teleport spells don't work the first time. Just use it a second time and they should pop right up!
