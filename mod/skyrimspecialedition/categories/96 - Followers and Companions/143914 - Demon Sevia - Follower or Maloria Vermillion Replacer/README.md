Visual Overhaul for Nether's Maloria using the red Sevia variant. Make sure to load the replacer after the main mod. Give this amazing follower a try!
  
  

  
* Replacer was made for the Non-Short version of Maloria, not sure if it works with the other.
Comes with the same custom body and skin from Sevia.
  
* Horns were replaced and work with the *hide horns* feature.
Small recolor to the tail so it fits better with the replacer.
  
* Color of the original wigs were changed to match replacer's hair color.

[font=Georgia]FAQ
  
  
[/font][font=Georgia]*- I cant find the follower/she's not showing up!?*[/font]
  
  
[font=Tahoma]This symptom can suggest you are not on latest Skyrim version and you dont have BEES installed. (this step is needed since i use CK Extended)[/font]
  
  
[font=Georgia]
  
*- I dont like the tattoos on the body, how do i remove them?*[/font]
  
  
Simply drop and replace her skin texture files inside the folder, if you want the same look without the tattoos then give her BnP - Bijin Adaptation from Swefrida's *BnP - Female Skin* mod, located in optional files and its called Extra Options CBBE. Black nails will be removed too if doing this.
  
  
[font=Georgia]
  
- *I want to get rid of her neck tattoo only, how?*[/font]Do the same as above but instead only replace the textures that start with the name *femalehead.* Replace with BnP - Bijin adaptation because otherwise you will get a neck seam.
  
  
[font=Georgia]*- Is there a simple way of removing the nose piercing?*[/font]Not that i know of.
  
  
[font=Georgia]*- Can i have the 3 follower variants at the same time?*[/font]Yes, things to keep in mind is that they have the same spells, combat style, location, etc. You can delete the skin files from 2 sevias to save space, as long as the skin exist in one of them they will all work. The same applies if you also have the replacers.
  
  
*[font=Georgia]
  
- Her body is not working with outfits or OBody, why?
  
[/font]*
  
If you have this problem then i recommend to change her body meshes inside the mod's folder. Drop your body files and replace.
  
  
Locate them in ***meshes>D7>Sevia>femalebody\_1, and etc***I tried giving her a body that you could build in Bodyslide Outfit Studio but it gave an error when batch building most of the time, so yeah idk.
  
  
*[font=Georgia]
  
- The Replacer has a neckseam! Help?
  
  
[/font]*If you added my replacer midsave then thats probably why, select her with console then type and enter these commands in the same order: "setnpcweight 60", "disable", and "enable".
