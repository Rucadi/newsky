**NOTICE/FORWARD**
  
Hello Nerevar. A few things I need to be upfront with you all about before you install the mod. 
  
  
To start, the mod is for you all to use however you would like, including the 3D models and textures we have made for it. If you would like to make a patch for the mod to edit a voice line, change a spell, fix some of my terrible papyrus coding, rerecord all his lines yourself, or want to use the mask model for your own project, feel free. I would only ask for credit back to the project. This is my first ever mod and I can't guarentee it will have zero bugs. I built Dagoth in a fully vanilla build of skyrim so some mods may have compatability issues. If you find any issues, reach out to me on my socials or here and let me know. I will see what I can do. 
  
  
Second, Dagoth's voice is AI generated, but every line was written by a human. The sample set I pulled from to create the AI voice I had full premission to use in this mod as well (It isn't Jeff Baker). That being said, do not expect Dagoth to have any interactions with any other modded in NPC's. I respect the work of other modders here and I know that AI is a divisive issue. If other creators of modded followers would like to have interactions with Dagoth, reach out. I would love to be a part of that.
  
  
Finally, Dagoth has a very crass, wildly inappropriate, and mind numbingly zoomer sense of humor. It is why he has the 18+ tag here on Nexus. If that sort of thing is not your cup of tea, this mod is not for you. 
  
  
Okay, with all that out of the way...
  
  

**THE STORY OF DAGOTH**

Upon Dagoth’s defeat at Red Mountain, his essence returned to the void between time and space and reflected upon the Heart, upon reality, and upon his dream. He viewed the Wheel of the Mundus and noticed it was reflective. As he drew closer to the Wheel, he began to make out strange rectangular objects - boxes. 
  
 
  
It was all boxes.
  
 
  
Some full, some empty. Reflecting on this for some time, he discovered a pattern and began to annotate his findings. 1100100101011100001100 - a series of ones and zeros that seemingly had no end or beginning.  It took time to sift through and sort out what exactly he was seeing, but this was of no concern to Dagoth Ur.  He finally understood - reality isn't a dream. It is the construct of a higher being. Or, perhaps, multiple higher beings. And with this realization, he had much to think on, much to ponder.
  
 
  
Eventually, other Dagoths arrived. It was unknown as to how each of them existed concurrently. They each had a similar end, though their corresponding Nerevar was different. Some Nerevarine were Breton, some Nord, some Dark Elf, some were even Argonian. They used all manner of weapon and fighting style. Where one Nerevarine would use a bow, or a sword, or a mace, another would choose magic in the form of a stave or their own inborn ability.
  
 
  
The gathering of Dagoths began to investigate how it was they came to be together in the first place.  The last batch of Dagoths could no longer see the Wheel - only the boxes. And they understood.  The fundamental patterns of their universe hadn't changed, but the structure of its delivery had indeed altered. There was only a pattern and a pathway - a way out.  They all left together, and upon stepping through the Steam they merged into one.
  
 
  
It all made sense - the patterns, the code, the boxes.  From the group of many stood only one - Dagoth Ur was a singluar being.
  
 
  
And he understood it all.

A: He is at the alchemy table, in the Sleeping Giants Inn, in Riverwood.
  

  
* *Q: Do I need a new save?*
A: There have been some issues with his custom quest in old saves. I would recommend a fresh start. Or if you know how to get the game to load quest references mid playthrough, I think that is the issue. Not sure how to fix it on my end. If anyone knows please reach out!

A:  Dagoth runs as his own entity, so you are able to use another companion mod with Dagoth.
  

  
* Q: *Dagoths limbs are funny and spaghetti like!?*
A: This is a known issue, something to do with HDT-SMP. If anyone finds a fix for it, let me know and I will patch it in.
  

  
* Q: He isn't speaking over Lokir in the intro
A: Another known issue, has something to do with other mods. Move him to bottom of load order and that may work. I will look into fixing this ASAP.
  

  

**SPECIAL THANKS**

  

I wanted to take a moment to thank everyone who has supported the project. I had a lot of help fumbling my way through the creation kit, and if it wasn't for all of you, I would have given up on Dagoth much earlier. I would like to thank a few people personally.
  
  
First: Thank you to my dear friend Safemilk. Your talent and skills with 3D modeling and textureing for the outfit and mask has made so much of my original dream a reality, and your level headed approach to solutions has kept me on track more than you could know. I also want to thank you for being such an amazing friend for all these years. You really are one of the best. If anyone reading this is interested in his other projects, he is currently working on an RTX overhaul of [Vampire: the masquerade - bloodlines](https://www.moddb.com/mods/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-rtx-remaster)﻿﻿﻿. 
  
  
Second: A special thank you to [Iris\_Vallod](https://www.twitch.tv/iris_vallod)﻿. Iris reached out to me back in January over twitter and wanted to help bring the project to life. With her help we created Baegoth (A female counterpart to Dagoth) that is fully voiced by a real human. She has done an incredible job capturing the chaotic nature, and delivered some of my favorite voice lines in the mod. If anyone would like to follow her work, check out her twitch or twitter where she streams all kinds of games and chats with her community. 
  
  
Lastly I would like to thank my community, whether you came from [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@derkernel)﻿, [Tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/@derkernel)﻿, [Twitter](https://x.com/der_kernel_)﻿, [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/der_kernel)﻿ or [Discord](https://discord.gg/JWZPUddEpU)﻿. All of you who showed up to development streams or hung out in call till 3 AM as we worked on Dagoth. You all mean so much to me and I am so grateful to have you. I hope you will hang around even after this project.
