This ESL-flagged plugin simply alters the player's dialogue to seem a little less neutral. The original dialogue has scenes where the player seems to not be as aggressive as they should be towards villains, there are threats that seem to think M'rissi is scarier than the player, and so on. 
  
  
**Dialogue Changes:**Spoiler
  
  
This mod changes only a few key lines of dialogue, with threats about M'rissi harming people being altered to be more feasible and including the player in the threat as well as M'rissi, and aggressive or nasty comments being made more so. 
  
  
For example, **"Take a look at the pissed off cat behind me and tell me you aren't intimidated"** is now changed to **[[b]"How about I hold you in place while M'rissi uses you as a scratch-post?"](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/133284/133284-1757785154-750319285.png)**[/b]
  
  
You can see how the threat still includes her but doesn't pretend she's far scarier than she actually is. It's also actually a very feasible threat. 
  
  
Other threats are in the same sort of style, and comments of hostility are more hostile, such as threats to harm villainous characters, notably adding more hostility towards Isael and [mentioning cutting up Salthazar](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/133284/133284-1757785153-690378229.png) and mercenaries. 
  
  
I also added some cursing (only the word that starts with an S followed by an H and ends in a T, nothing heavy) when the player character is angry, such as expressing more anger at M'rissi for trying to kill the player during the quest "Feline Solidarity". Nothing nasty, just telling her off more. 
  
  
There is also a line in the base mod where the player sighs and references the Divines, which is a problem if the character disagrees with the line about the number of Divines (i.e. whether they believe in Talos) or doesn't think much of the Divines at all. This line is replaced with a generic **"damn it..."** for maximum immersion compatibility. 
  
  
In addition, some of the evil storyline's comments are made nastier, in keeping with the sort of violent control freak the character would have to be to take that route. The lines definitely enhance the mean spirit of that route. 
  
  
There are also some minor grammar fixes.
  
  
  
**Stage 7 Name Fix:**
  
  
There is also an additional plugin that changes the name of the Stage 7 quest from "Reminisce" to "Demons of the Past". This was agreed as the best choice between myself and the original author KreaQ for several reasons:
  
Spoiler
  
The quest is about confronting M'rissi's most painful memories, and meanwhile to reminisce refers to the act of remembering fond memories. I discussed this and several possible name options with the mod author, and ultimately "Demons of the Past" was chosen as the best choice, due to how it describes her past pain as well as implying the act of confronting it, while also implying an entity was responsible, which is true, as her pain all traces back to one perpetrator. 
  
  
  
**Both plugins are flagged as ESL, which means they don't take up a slot in your load order.**
