**December 16 — Release Day!**

Hey guys! So glad to finally release this. The Ashe and Serana (Asherana hehehe) banter project got so big that it outgrew just being a patch, that it became its own mod page, its own package, and honestly its own experience. Guys, you're getting 1k+ lines of duo chemistry across Dawnguard as well as Ashe's main quest, plus radiant travel banter, location awareness, combat exchanges, and romance-awareness.
  
  
**Quick note:** This lives as its own page because the banter grew into a standalone **integration plugin** with its own assets/records, and it requires **both** Ashe + SDA — so it’s clean and simple to install/update.
  
  
If you enjoy it, please endorse + vote - it’s the single biggest boost for visibility (Hot Files, more eyes, more feedback, more updates). ❤️

**What This Mod Does:**
  
This mod adds a massive Ashe x Serana duo integration for SDA + Ashe: **1,000+ lines** of quest-aware, radiant, and location-aware banter, plus joint combat exchanges and romance-aware commentary. Designed so they feel like a real duo that grows throughout Dawnguard and Ashe’s main quest.
  
  
Key Features

  
* **1,000+ lines** of Ashe × Serana integrated dialogue
**Dawnguard + Ashe main quest awareness** (scripted beats + follow-through)
  
* **Radiant + location-aware banter** for travel/downtime
**Joint combat banter** with duo pacing
  
* **Romance-aware dialogue**, including route-aware behavior
**Two recommended play routes** with different emotional pacing
  

**Feature Breakdown**
  
**Quest Awareness (Scripted)**
  
**Dawnguard coverage includes major beats such as:**
  

  
* Awakening
Bloodline
  
* Chasing Echoes
Beyond Death
  
* Unseen Visions
Touching the Sky
  
* Kindred Judgment
Post-questline follow-through / romance context
  

**Ashe questline coverage (chapter-structured, progression-aware):**
  

  
* Prologue — Whispers of White Hair
Chapter 1 — A Borrowed Soul
  
* Chapter 2 — All for One
Chapter 3 — Echoes of the Oath
  
* Chapter 4 — Shadows of the Past
Chapter 5 — Through Hell and High Water
  
* Chapter 6 — One For All *(incl. “Shattered Orphans” cutscene beats)*
Chapter 7 — Go Beyond: Vestiges Reborn
  

**Cross-awareness**
  

  
* Ashe and Serana comment on each other’s developments and changing context—not just generic player reactions.

**Radiant + Location Awareness**

  
* Radiant conversations outside quests (not “hello spam”)
Location-aware commentary during travel/exploration
  
* Cooldown-aware pacing to reduce interruptions during serious moments

**Combat Banter**

  
* Combat detection lines tuned to avoid repetition
Taunts/reactions designed to leave room for duo exchanges
  

**Romance Awareness**

  
* Relationship-context commentary (friendship vs romance changes tone)
Branching behavior at the point-of-no-return choice (Fantasy Mode clearly called out as canon-adjacent)

**Duo Dynamic**
  
Ashe and Serana aren’t written as “two followers who occasionally talk.” Their conversations are built around contrast: Ashe is calm, precise, and purpose-driven; Serana is witty, instinctive, and emotionally sharp. They challenge each other’s coping habits - stonewalling vs deflection - so scenes can shift from playful to philosophical without feeling forced. The bond evolves with your playthrough.
  
  
**INSTALL STEPS**
  

  
1. Install **Serana Dialogue Add-On (SDA)** *(and any required SDA patches for your setup)*
Install **Ashe: Crystal Heart** *(and any required Ashe patches for your setup)*
  
2. Install **Ashe × Serana Banter Patch**
(Optional) Install one of the Asherana cooldown patches (if you want longer banter cooldowns for your setup)
  
  

**Load order:** keep the banter patch **after** Ashe and SDA.
  
[line]**FOR BEST CONTENT EXPERIENCE**
  
(And yes - you can replay both routes. You won’t experience everything in one save.)
  
Ashe’s Questline Branch

  
1. Recruit Ashe in the Winking Skeever.
Play Ashe’s quest until **“A Borrowed Soul”** completes.
  
2. Start Dawnguard → recruit Serana → then finish either Serana’s questline or Ashe’s (your choice).
Finish the remaining questline afterward.
  
  

Serana’s Questline Branch

  
1. Start Dawnguard → recruit Serana.
Finish the early quest beats (return her home, then pick her up again).
  
2. Recruit Ashe → play Ashe’s quest until **“A Borrowed Soul”** completes.
Same thing: finish whichever questline you want first, then complete the other.
  
  

Both branches have unique scripted banter and emotional pacing.
  
  
**ROMANCE**
  
You can romance both for a while - they’re chill with it up until the point-of-no-return (**Serana’s confession near the end of Dawnguard**). At that point, you choose:
  

  
* Ashe route
Serana route
  
* **Fantasy Mode** (non-canon side path where you keep both)

Fantasy Mode has **limited banter**. They aren’t fully silent toward each other (I didn’t want to neuter their awareness), but it’s meant as fan service / canon-adjacent - not a full story path.
  
  
SAVE GAME NOTES

  
* Safe on existing saves (until further notice)
Recommended to try new saves for the full narrative experience
  
* Safe with beta save progress.

  
Compatibility / Notes

  
* This mod is intentionally large and will **not** be ESL-ified due to scope.
This is an **integration experience**: it doesn’t add new quests/locations by itself - its “content” is awareness, banter, and pacing across two major storylines.
  

FEEDBACK
  
Open to hearing your feedback! Either comment on the mod page, or send me a DM! I'll do my best to reply.
  
  
FAQ:
  
**Q: Will this mod get more updates?**
  
A: Currently, my focus will be on finishing the rest of the SDA sunset updates as well as Ashe content (maybe even some Aela hehehe), so active development on this particular thing (Ashe and Serana banter) is not currently at the forefront. But I do plan to write a few new conversations here and there, spicing up Ashe's eventual awareness for some of the future main/faction quests (as well as some basic Serana awareness for Ashe's future quests). Still, these will be minimal; most of the content you'll see is already included in this mod. Bugfixes will continue as needed (hopefully very few of them!).
  
**Q: What do I need to install for this to work?**
  
**A:** You need **Ashe: Crystal Heart**, **Serana Dialogue Add-On (SDA)**, and this **Ashe × Serana Banter Patch**. Older Ashe × SDA patches are deprecated and should not be used.
  
**Q: The banter cooldown is too fast/frequent!**
  
A: Install one of the optional Slower or Much Slower cooldown files. These cooldowns use in-game time, so anything that advances time faster (fast travel, waiting, timescale/timezone mods) will also make the cooldown elapse sooner.
  
**Q: Do I need to uninstall anything first?**
  
**A:** Remove older versions of Ashe or SDA before installing updated versions. Install the banter patch **after** both mods so it wins conflicts.
  
**Q: Is this safe to install mid-playthrough?**
  
**A:** Yes, it’s generally safe on existing saves. A new save is recommended for the full intended narrative pacing. **Dev-build saves are not supported.**
  
**Q: Does this work with Nether’s Follower Framework (NFF)?**
  
**A:** Yes. Serana can be imported into NFF while Ashe remains outside of it. Their banter and interactions will still function correctly.
  
**Q: Should I import Ashe into a follower framework?**
  
**A:** No. Ashe is not designed to be imported into follower frameworks, and doing so may break features or dialogue.
  
**Q: Serana (or Ashe) stopped commenting for a while — is this a bug?**
  
**A:** Not usually. Banter is intentionally **gated by quest progress, scenes, and pacing**. Quiet stretches are normal and dialogue resumes at the next appropriate beat.
  
**Q: Can I romance both Ashe and Serana?**
  
**A:** You can romance both until **Serana’s point-of-no-return confession near the end of Dawnguard**. At that point, you choose Ashe, Serana, or **Fantasy Mode** (canon-adjacent, limited banter).
  
**Q: Where should I report bugs or odd behavior?**
  
**A:** Comment on the mod page, discord, or bug reports section. Please include quest progress, load order, and whether the issue is repeatable.
