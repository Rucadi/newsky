# Varinia - Custom Voiced Retired Spy and Companion
- Author: Maplespice
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

Trigger Warning:
  
  
This mod deals explicitly with suicidal ideations. The writing handles this as heartfelt as possible, but also very blatantly. Varinia is at best nihilistic. If this is something that triggers you, I'd suggest you pass on this one.
  
  
**Overview:**Varinia is an Imperial spy, contemplating if she really wants to continue her profession. When you meet her at the Candlehearth Hall in Windhelm, your answer to her abrupt question will set her course to either maintaining her status quo, or abandoning her old life. If you choose the latter, she will ask to join you, believing Mephala, her preferred Daedric Prince, has tied your fates together.
  
  
She is custom-voiced, with over 1500 lines. She is aware of all the usual stuff followers are aware of: Cities and towns, weather, and time. Like many custom followers, she runs on her own follower system, so do NOT use other follower management mods on her. Do NOT have AFT in your load order AT ALL. She will break.
  
  
Varinia has a sort of regard system, though hers is a bit different from simply liking you, or not. Since she has decided she wants to stay your companion through any means necessary, she will attempt to read what sort of person you are. Are you a 'good' person, or do you prefer theft and murder? Do you like your companions to fawn over you, or do you just want them around to haul your junk? Her primary scale, that unlocks new dialogue, is her measure of how honest she can be with you. She has spent her life pretending to be other people, so she has very little experience sharing her true thoughts and feelings with others. Over time, and if you are the sort of person she decides to share with, she might get better at it.
  
  
**Features:**Spoiler
  
*Outfits:* Varinia is inclined to switch up how she looks regularly. Depending on if she is in a town, a dungeon, or the wilderness, she will dress accordingly. She also has several wigs that she will swap out. You can tell her to stop doing this.
  
  
*Follow Distance:* Four options to choose from here: Close, Medium, Vanilla, and Far.
  
  
*Rumours:* Varinia puts her skills to good use by picking up rumours around town. These are in the same vein as the rumours innkeepers give the player, and just like those, they will begin certain quests. You can tell her to stop doing this.
  
  
*Quest Skipping:* Varinia can be very persuasive. She also often knows things that might be helpful for certain quests. With these, you can ask her to help you skip certain parts of vanilla quests. This is optional.
  
  
*Set Home:* You can tell Varinia to live in any player home, included modded ones if they have the right keywords, and she will return there when dismissed.
  
  
*Sandbox:* You can tell Varinia to sandbox or not when waiting. If you are familiar with Remiel, I've elected to have this feature as opposed to the 'relax' feature, specifically so Varinia works more seamlessly with mods like Swiftly Order Squad.
  
  
*Summon:* Varinia has a unique summon system. She has trained three crows to carry messages for her, and she teaches you how to do the same. Using her crows, you can call her to your side.
  
  
*Turn off Idle Commentary:* You can tell Varinia to stop speaking at random, except for during battle. This will also turn off her idles for quest commentary. If you choose to do this, her commentary will instead be through 'Hellos,' meaning you'll want to chat with her often during quests to hear what she thinks about them.
  
  
*Sit out battles:* You can tell Varinia to not fight in battles, if you're like me and have 19389 followers, or you just like to fight on your own. If you choose to do this, she will "flee" when combat starts and rejoin you when you are done.
  
  
  
**Quest Commentary:**Spoiler
  
I've focused more on conversations with this mod. Varinia has plenty of one-off comments for quests, but she also has many more conversations regarding quests. Again, you'll want to chat with her often to catch these.
  
  
**Vanilla Quests**
  
  
*Main Quest*Faction Quests
  
  
*College of Winterhold
  
The Dark Brotherhood
  
Thieves' Guild
  
Companions*
  
Daedric Quests
  
  
*Discerning the Transmundane
  
The Whispering Door*
  
  
  
**Custom Quests:**Spoiler
  
Varinia has one custom quest at this time:
  
  
Work Too Hard, Then Play is Too Hard
  
  
Help Varinia learn how to have fun by giving her hobbies to try out.
  
  
*Requirement:* None
  
  
  
**Requirements:**
  
None except the DLCs
  
  
However, I do recommend [Fuz Ro D-oh](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15109) since Varinia's crows have 'dialogue' that cannot be read otherwise.
  
  
  
**Compatibility:**Incompatible:*Amazing Follower Tweaks*Soft Incompatibility:
  
  
*Other Follower Frameworks (i.e. - NFF). Just don't import her into them.***Predicted FAQ:***Marriage/Romance?*Nah, Varinia ain't that kind of gal.
  
  
*Safe to add/update midsave?*Yeah.
  
  
*Body type?*Vanilla.
  
  
*She sounds like Remiel?*Yeah.*Does she say 'ruin' wrong?*Hopefully not. But to maintain equilibrium, she pronounces something else 'incorrectly', I'm sure.
  
*Banter?*Not right now.
  
  
*Not even with Remi?*[No.](https://youtube.com/shorts/w8O7T9jBOdA?si=JB3YRCDz0znsxyEC)
