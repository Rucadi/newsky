**Introduction**
  
  
I've been wanting a mod that allows you to turn Ralof or Hadvar into followers without creating standalone duplicates of those NPCs, and so I went to create one, using [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/89192) as a template for Hadvar's voiced follower dialogue. Credits to [semiramisu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/719977) and [Blackintegral](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/21450344) for the original idea.
  
  
  
**What this mod does:**
  

  
* Firstly this mod adds a quest script that checks if the CWFinale quest is at least at stage 400 which means you've beaten the civil war questline at this point. Once that check is fullfilled, the script makes sure that both Hadvar and Ralof are enabled and are moved to the Sleeping Giant Inn in Riverwood where they will hang out and sometimes chat, despite being rivals.

  

  
* The script will also swap their outfits based on who you sided with. The one you sided with will be equipped with a set of Officer armor (no helmet) from their respective factions and if you have [Immersive Armors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3479)﻿, they will be equipped with the Heroic Stormcloak/Imperial armor sets from that mod. Or else they will be equpped with outfits that are almost identical to what they were wearing at the beginning of the vanilla game.

  

  
* When you talk to them, they'll have a new voiced dialogue option to recruit them, but if either of them aren't in the CWBuddies faction, they may turn down your offer in a brutally honest way. Comes with a persuasion check that requires a pretty high speechcraft (average). (If they don't immediately have this dialogue, try to save in front of them and reload)

  
* After successfully recruiting Hadvar or Ralof, they will also get added to the potential marriage faction. Hadvar's voicetype has been added to the VoicesMarriageRough formlist and his lines for marriage have been voiced with the help of ~~SKVASynth~~ 11labs in the latest version.

  

  
* I have added perks to Ralof and Hadvar which I think would make sense for their gear and combat style. For instance, Ralof will have the Hack and Slash perk as well as Agile Defender since he's equipped with light armor and a war axe, while Hadvar will have the Bladesman and Shield Wall perks. I also gave both of them the Light Foot perk to make sure they won't trigger any hazardous traps, and of course the basic Armsman/Overdraw perks to boost their damage output. I also edited their inventory to give them slightly better gear (gave Ralof a Steel War Axe and a Hunting Bow, gave Hadvar a heavy Imperial Shield and an Imperial Bow and gave them both Steel Arrows), and raised their level cap from 50 to 10.

  
* Ralof and Hadvar, as followers, are intended for lawful players. I don't think they will appreciate you commiting crimes in front of them, neither can you command them to do bad deeds themselves, they will refuse.

  
* In recent versions of this mod, I've made it so that Ralof/Hadvar will attend the Battle of Solitude/Windhelm, implementing "new" scenes without touching the vanilla ones. This mod also comes with an add-on that tweaks the scenes I added in the main plugin, making it so that Ralof and Hadvar will face off and it'll be possible to kill the one on the opposing side. A small issue I notice tho, is that as soon as Ulfric/Tullius gets knocked out, Ralof/Hadvar will also exit combat, so it'd be possible to spare them, but they'll no longer have the Essential flag.

  
  
**Compatibility notes:**
  
  

  
* This mod is fully compatible with [Alternate Start](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/272) since it technically doesn't kill off one actor after you've given the other a healing potion, just disables them.

  
* For better compatibility with [Opening Scene Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/168), I recommend that you check out my other mod [Opening Scene Overhaul - Original Voice for Hadvar](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/88100)

  
* I've also just playtested [Serious Civil War Finale Sieges](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81548) and there seems to be no conflicts with my mod, now that I was updating to v2.3﻿

  
  
**Installation:**
  
Either install through Vortex, or manually download the archive and extract the Data folder to your Skyrim SE folder
  
(C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition)
  
Then run LOOT and then enable the .esp plugin in a mod manager of your choice. (I use Wrye Bash)
  
**Make sure you load the AuthenticCWFollowers.esp plugin BEFORE any other mods that make edits to them like NPC overhauls, then rebuild your Bashed Patch, 0.esp. I've made sure to add some essential bash tags to the plugin.**
