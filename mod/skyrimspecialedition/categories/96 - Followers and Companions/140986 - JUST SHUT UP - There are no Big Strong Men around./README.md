I play with lots of companions, but every time I pick up a Male Nord he needs to announce to all the women in the party how manly he is. It happens way too often for my liking and honestly it's been giving me a headache every damn time it plays. So I went in to it and made it only ever play in a test cell. The quest, DialogueGenericScene04, makes the voice lines lines play as long as these characters share a cell, so sometimes it can even play just the two women's, or just the nord man's lines, given they're far away enough. This makes it extra annoying because then they're just talking with ghosts because one of the characters is out of the player's hearing range.
  
 When using follower mods that allow multiple followers to idle, this quest can be triggered multiple times in just a few short minutes. Funny maybe once or twice, but having to hear the same conversation numerous times in less than 5 minutes, it gets very annoying. It will even frequently play when idling in towns and inns as long as these voice types are present.
  
  
Also re: half the comments. Stop being weird. It's an optional mod to make a specific set of voicelines never play. Get over yourselves if you think this is some political message thing. I'm just tired of hearing these voicelines and I'm sure plenty other people must be too.
