**Deirdre Wulfarth**

  
*I have missed so much while I was cloistered away in those damnable forsworn camps. It's time that I live for me again!*Deirdre had always been a bit strange. She was a Nord that chose to join the Forsworn cause and even completed the ritual to become a hagraven because of her exceptional gift with magic. She has since become disenchanted with the Forsworn way of life and wishes to live amongst others again. If she could manage it she would even like to put herself out there and experience love again.  
  
  
Deirdre fully realizes that her hold on the glamour to make her appear as a maiden isn't perfect and she only recently mastered the ability to hold it for long periods of time. Hopefully, the person she ends up traveling with will accept her for who she really is and not just what she looks like on the outside. 
  
  
**Important: Please Read**
  
  
Deirdre's hagraven form is set to the vanilla hagraven. This means that you can use whatever replacer you would like. I personally like [this one](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72982) or [this one](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72425) by PSBoss. 
  
  
**﻿﻿What is this enemy to ally thing?**
  
  
All E2A followers come equipped with a very special feature. They no longer sit around waiting for you while clogging up valuable inn space. Instead, each follower is placed out in the world for you to discover and defeat. Only then will you be considered worthy of their time and have the ability to recruit them as a companion. 
  
  
**But where are they?**
  
  
That's for me to know and you to find out by traversing Skyrim and playing as you normally would. You're bound to run across them as they are not hidden. 
  
  
Note: If you really must cheat you can look at the included text document in the zip file for their possible locations. Yes. You read that right. Each follower has three possible locations where they might spawn.

**Issues**
  
  
If you have a neck seam please check first if you have a mod like Wet Function Redux active. This may be the culprit. 
  
  
It is a known issue that the teleport spells don't work the first time. Just use it a second time and she should pop right up!
