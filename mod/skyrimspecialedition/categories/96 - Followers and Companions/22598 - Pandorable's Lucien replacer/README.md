# Pandorable's Lucien replacer
- Author: Pandorable

**ABOUT**A simple replacer for Lucien. I edited his appearance slightly for personal use and decided to share it, with JosephRussell's permission. I did my best not to stray too far from Lucien's original look so that it would still feel like him. 
  
  
VERSION 1
  
V1 is very similar to the original Lucien and simply edits his head mesh a little. This version uses all vanilla assets - meaning that Lucien will use whatever body/skin/eyes/brows/beard/hair texture mods you have installed. This also means he will look different depending on what mods you have. 
  
  
VERSION 2
  
V2 is **not**an update to v1, instead it is slightly less vanilla-like and more up to date with my current style. This version uses a high poly version of Lucien's vanilla hair and comes with some custom textures. Just like v1, this version uses whichever skin and body mod you have installed.
