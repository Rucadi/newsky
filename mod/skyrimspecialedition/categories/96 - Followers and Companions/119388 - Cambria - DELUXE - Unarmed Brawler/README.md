[Old Skyrim version here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/118389)
  
**This is a relaunch of a previous mod, with significant upgrades!**
  
  
[font=Times New Roman]Cambria is a beautiful prize-fighter from Cyrodiil who is traveling Skyrim in search of new challenges.
  
She is accustomed to fighting unarmed, and in little or no clothing, for the entertainment of a crowd.
  
She will join you on your travels, make sassy comments, and punch the living hell out of bad guys!
  
She can only fight close-up, but she hits very hard.
  
  
You can meet Cambria at the Bee and Barb in Riften.[/font]

  
 **﻿ ﻿﻿﻿Available Dialogue:**
  
[font=Times New Roman] ﻿- Flirty intro conversation when you first meet her
  
 ﻿- "I'd like to speak with you" dialogue tree includes longer conversations about her fascinating life
  
 ﻿- "What do you think of (location)" options open up in most towns/cities
  
 ﻿- A wealth of possible random chatter as you travel, but she does not talk your ear off!
  
 ﻿- A wealth of funny hello/goodbye responses when you interact with her
  
 ﻿- Most lines are limited to once per day to avoid repeating herself
  
 ﻿- Created using a mix of hand-edited vanilla voice lines and SKVA Synth
  
 ﻿- Uses tough-sounding "Female Commander" vanilla voice type
  
 ﻿- She will mix in standard vanilla responses and also any added dialogue from mods like RDO
  
 ﻿- Current count of lines unique to the mod = 200+ emphasizing quality over quantity
  
 ﻿- Created with the intention that every time she talks, it should be interesting![/font]
  
  
 **﻿ ﻿Other Features:**
  
[font=Times New Roman] ﻿- A unique battle-scarred skin texture!
  
 ﻿- Scars are present on every texture layer and react to lighting in cool ways
  
 ﻿- Unique armor that can be crafted, upgraded, or disenchanted
  
 ﻿- Armor gives bonuses to unarmed damage, and has a story behind it if you ask
  
 ﻿- Invisible fist "weapon" that hits very hard
  
 ﻿- Standard follower compatible with any follower management mod
  
 ﻿- High-poly head
  
 ﻿- Face and body presets available in optional download
  
 ﻿- ESL flagged[/font]
  
  
 **﻿ ﻿File under "Friends of Misty Skye"**
  
[font=Times New Roman] ﻿This mod contains saucy adult humor reminiscent of Misty Skye, but is not directly connected.
  
 ﻿Her armor is cross-compatible with the outfits from that mod if you wish.
  
 ﻿Cambria was originally conceived as a possible side character for Misty to meet,
  
 ﻿before being spun off into this unrelated thing.[/font]
  
  
 **﻿ ﻿Why the relaunch?**
  
[font=Times New Roman] ﻿This mod was pretty basic when I first put it out, and wasn't huge.
  
 ﻿Unless you noticed it the first time and bothered to track it,
  
 ﻿you would miss the many big upgrades I've been making.
  
[/font] [font=Times New Roman]﻿I'm hoping now it will find its audience.
  
 ﻿Please endorse if you like it![/font]
