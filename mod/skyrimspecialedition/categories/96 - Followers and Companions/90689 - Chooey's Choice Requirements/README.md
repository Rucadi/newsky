**† Chooey's Choice Requirements †**
  
**Powered by SkyPatcher**
  
  
**The Chooey's Choice set** is an NPC looks overhaul series from yours truly, [naChooey](http://www.chooey.me/#main)﻿﻿, utilizing advanced tech and lovely character resources from talented authors to get these NPCs to look as handsome/beautiful as they are. Without these authors, this project would not exist.
  
  
✧ **ADVANCED** With advancements thanks to [Zzyxzz](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Zzyxzz?gameId=1704), the creator of [SkyPatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106659) not seen in any other NPC replacer mod, developing the Chooey's Choice series and fixing issues becomes easier, to your benefit and mine.
  
  
**FOR MODLIST CREATORS:**
  
  
I want to make my replacers accessible and painless to implement.
  
The only requirements are: [SkyPatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106659) & [Chooey's Choice Requirements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90689)
  
Both of these mods are compatible with Special Edition, Anniversary Edition, and VR.
  
[SkyPatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106659) is used for seamlessly applying visual overhauls to NPC's, totally avoiding load order issues.![](https://i.imgur.com/b6FtPee.png)
  
✧ **NEW IN GEN6.6.6** - Chooey's Choice Requirements and the rest of the Chooey's Choice series (& more) now fully leverages the capabilities of [SkyPatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106659), now functionally completely different from the previous 6.0.0 and 5.0.0 versions.
  
  
✧ Having a mod like this reduces the cumulative size of all the Chooey's Choice replacers since they use similar assets, resulting in lower VRAM usage and overall bloat in your modlist.
  
  
✧ All my replacers will use your installed body (CBBE, 3BA, UNP, UNPB, BHUNP). Feel free to use OBody without any incompatibilities.

**F.A.Q:**
  
  
**Q:** Why [font=CORMORANT GARAMOND][SkyPatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106659)[/font]?
  
**A:** [font=CORMORANT GARAMOND][SkyPatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106659)[/font] released an update that solves load order problems with replacers, that may lead to the black-face bug. Additionally, replacers have become universally compatible with everything (except replacers for the same NPCs, obviously)
