**﻿Please Read****This follower original(non demon) preset was actually created from the user [ArkaiyisAngel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/129351038) Laufey preset. They made a really great character so all credits goes to them for creating Laufey original form. Sense they made such a good character. I decided she was more than worthy of being converted as a demon and so Laufey the Tiefling was born.
  
  
As always she will be a regular female in your game...if you want something more extra down there well** [Check here for details](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/31390-futanemesislol-followers-schlong-texture-patches-and-schlong-addons/) **so that you can give her a schlong. She uses demoniac skin
  
  
[size=5]Like my other mods this wouldn't be possible without the help of the user luckysven of making her into a follower![/size]
  
  
![](https://a.l3n.co/i/OWi5Q7.gif)﻿****About Laufey
  
First i recommend to use [nether follower framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55653)
  
Her class is a Combat sorcerer and she mainly uses fire spells. Comes equipped with a staff. Her other spells includes fast healing, stoneflesh, and steadfast ward.  When talking to Laufey she is equipped with three different glasses types from the mod [Witchy Fashion cloudy bling](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/102790) created by [Sakurateawitch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/185883138)﻿﻿. Her horns also comes from that mod. If you wish to change her glasses just take them out of her inventory and give her one of the glasses. My personal favorite is anime villian and chain(from the screens above). Her horns are permanently attached to her head. There are some pics of her above having black horns however she does not come with those. She comes with the one in the gif. I also fixed her ear from clipping with her horns. The gif was an old vid i took before the final product. She uses demoniac skin and does not come with the tail..because it prevented ease of access

 She uses the young and eager voice and she is a little strong when fighting enemies. She is marriageable and essential and she is fearless in battle. Will be naked when you find her and last but not least...she has shark like teeth
  
  
For those that doesn't use enb compare the last 2 images. She doesn't look too different from her enb counterpart
  
  
  
About her tats
  
She does not come with her succubus tattoo but she does come with her flamebringer armtat created by [Rikushai](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/4247951?tab=user+files)﻿. If you want the tat for your own character be sure to visit that mod page [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24132?tab=description)﻿ .As for my follower it won't glow unless you use the miscellaneous file which requires slavetats( use google to search for it remember to download the se version). Just be sure to click add/remove in that mcm menu when you download the mod from here. You are looking to add it to her body and hands( the glow that is). After that make it glow orange!**
  
**Location
  
  
She is located inside of the broken fang cave. However be careful it has skeletons and vampires in the cave. If you don't know where it is, just use google.**
  
 ﻿If for whatever she is not there( or you are just lazy) type in the console command 
  
1.help Laufey (then press enter)
  
2. then type player.placeatme (their reference id) you will find what her reference id is after you did the first step above.
  
An alternate route for this is using the mod [Where are you](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76063) which is easier than the console command way sense it has a couple of other options as well.
  
  
**Note for other mod authors**If this mod somehow gets popular enough that someone wants to give her a custom voice by all means go ahead and give her a unique voice. Just let me know so i can be the first to download!
  
  
**Quick info for no vagina patch 
  
If you don't want the vagina crowding the area down there when giving her a little something extra download that patch in the optional files. She won't have a vagina as long as the armor you give her doesn't take up the "body" armor slot. Check this mod out so you can view your [armor slots](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49608) when checking your inventory﻿**
  
**﻿****FAQ**
  
  
Will you release a no horn version?
  
  
I honestly don't think I have to. Just delete her horn nif in her folder and that should work
  
  
Will you release a bhunp version of this?
  
  
Not now and not ever. Also did you read what i said above. Someone else helped me make this follower for me. I wouldn't even know how to make a bhunp version. You can however make it yourself if you want to
  
  
**Will you share the Preset? She looks amazing!!**
  
~~This question really depends on how I am feeling as I sometimes release presets here and there. So i'm not really sure. It may or may not happen. Also if you read what i said earlier her preset is already available just not this version.~~**[Here she is](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/137306)﻿**
  
  
**I think that's it feel free to share lewd images or cool ones if you want! Also endorse if you enjoy the mod!
