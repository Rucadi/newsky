Pluginless replacer for Rosa Roundbottom.
  
  
Rosa was among the first follower mods I installed back when I got a PC to play Skyrim. Something about her was visually very striking, and how she dressed was hot, of course. However, I've never been a fan of her face. Stylistically, it's creator was aiming for a more anime look, which I believe does not look good translated into 3D, especially with lighting like Skyrim's. She also stood out among the other NPCs in my game too much, which lead me to create this face replacement. What I hoped to capture was something that loosely fit skyrim's visual design, while also being attractive and maintaining her distinct visual traits such as the purple eyes, the warpaint, and the hair.
