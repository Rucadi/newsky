Varrick Veil is a man of blood and faith. Raised the majority of his life inside the cult of Boethiah, Varrick grew up knowing that in the world of Nirn the key to surviving is strength and power. Unlike other cultists of Boethiah, Varrick finds himself traversing Tamriel only to find himself now in Skyrim. However, don't let yourself be fooled by this man for not all appears as it seems with Varrick. While some cultists believe that mortals deserve to suffer at the hands of Boethiah and fight each other to the death, Varrick believes Boethiah teaches the strength to live and teaches others to wield that same power. He's not a man who craves blood, but life. And doesn't seek out death, but preserves survival.

  
  

If the ideology of this man doesn't convince you how amazing he is, also note, that he loves Dad jokes!

**FAQ**
  
Where can I find Varrick?
  
 ﻿Varrick can be found just outside of Morthal. Take the south exit of Morthal and head to the east. He will be surrounded by various dead Vigilants of Stendarr.
  
  
I can’t talk to Varrick the first time I meet him.
  
 ﻿This is a bug in the game. Go ahead and quick save and reload the game. 
  
  
The Vigilants around Varrick are T-Posing.
  
 ﻿This is a bug I haven’t found a solution to yet. 
  
  
Does he react to any quests?
  
 ﻿At the moment no, but there are future plans to make add more.
  
  
Is he romanceable?
  
 ﻿Not yet, but he will be in the future. 
  
  
Will he be romance focus?
  
 ﻿No. Varrick is meant to be open as a romance option, but he is mostly friend-focused. 
  
  
I found a bug.
  
 ﻿Oh no! Please let me know about it right away!
  
  
I have a recommendation for Varrick.
  
 ﻿I would love to hear it!

**PS.** I do not take credit for the dad jokes in this mod. I'm horrible at making them. They are just jokes I've found on the internet.
