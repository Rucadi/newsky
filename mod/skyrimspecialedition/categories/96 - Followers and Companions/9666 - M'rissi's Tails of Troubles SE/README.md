**{Description}**
  
  
You may know her already, but this time it's all different.
  
A rebirth of my old mod, rebuilt from scratch with rewritten scenario and scripts, brand new models/textures and professional quality voice acting.
  
Everything is done as it was meant to be.
  
  
Here you can actually be who you want to be - good, neutral or evil. An exemplary hero, or a sly slaver.
  
Every decision counts. Some consequences may surprise you, so be prepared.
  
  
Meet a strange girl, try to get to know her better. Or not.
  
You should know that she's quite a character, with her own opinions. And she will get to know you, step by step.
  
Just don't forget - she's a Khajiit, and some racial stereotypes are true.

**{What will you get?}**
  
  

  
* A long and dark story, with about 8 hours of gameplay for each ending.
7 main quests and 1 optional.
  
* 3 true endings, and several minor ones.
Dialogue options to choose from in almost every conversation, which will affect the ending - among them a few unique options, available based on player's race, skills, etc.
  
* Full voice acting for every new NPC. What's more, 2 voice types to choose between for the main character.
Several new locations and items.
  
* Knowledge of some Khajiiti customs.
A maid for your house, who will cook for you and teach you a few thief-oriented skills.
  
* Collectable hand-drawn sketches.
And last but not least - a unique follower.
  

  
Don't ask why she looks like this, it's explained in the mod. Play it and you can find out.
  
  
**As a follower, she:**
  

  
* will reply differently depending on relationship status and endings.
likes to comment on what's around her - places, people, and on you as well (you can change how often she comments by giving her special potions - at some point in the story the trader added by this mod starts selling them).
  
* knows several songs and likes to sing if asked nicely.
has a satchel (and will use items placed in it), and a backpack (which is a safe storage she won't touch).
  
* will not conflict with vanilla quests and mods that alter followers, because she uses a separate, custom system made just for her.
will ride a tiger mount (unlockable at some point of the "good" routes).
  
* can be teleported to the player almost anytime (this also needs to be unlocked).
does not affect follower count.
  
* remembers where to live if dismissed (you have to tell her the location first, but it doesn't have to be a player-owned house!)
wears several outfits - some she gets as the story progresses, others you can make, others she can find somewhere and... borrow.
  
* can be told to wear a specific armor if you gained her trust (or her obedience).
will learn new tricks to use in combat - if you teach her, that is; will you?
  
* moves around interacting with everything if she's bored by the player standing still.
can be silenced via a special item if you're tired of her voice.
  
* won't set off traps.
will not kill you or your other followers in case of friendly fire.
  
* is mortal, but can be made unkillable using an item (you can get one after every true ending).
has a few face and body variants to choose from (as installation options).
  
* loves Moon Sugar!

**{Got stuck? Have a question?}**
  
  
Read the FAQ in the Articles section.
  
There is also a comprehensive guide with a walkthrough (if you don't fear spoilers...)
  
It's highly recommended to check the FAQ before asking questions.

**{Requirements}**
  
  
This mod only requires the official DLCs:
  

  
* Dawnguard
Dragonborn
  

  
No other mods nor SKSE are needed, this mod is completely standalone.

**{Installation}**
  
  
I recommend to use a mod manager - this will give you access to the installer that will show you descriptions and screenshots, and install the right files for you based on your choices.
  
  
  
**Manual installation** (if for some reason you can't use a mod manager):
  
Extract the following folders from the mod archive into your Skyrim/Data:
  
  
*Required files*
  
00 Core\   ← this includes all her default textures, UNP body and voice files by Sininensusi
  
04 Faces\Main\   ← this is required if you don't choose one of the non-default face variants described below)
  
  
*Voice files - optional*
  
07 Voices\Adlora\   ← voice files by AdloraHealer, overwrites voice files by Sininensusi
  
  
*Face models - optional, don't choose more than 1*
  
04 Faces\Catg\   ← catgirl face model (only model, textures are in body texture variants)
  
04 Faces\Furry\   ← furry face model (only model, textures are in body texture variants)
  
04 Faces\Main2\   ← default face, but with thinner cheeks
  
  
*Body textures - only for UNP body, optional, don't choose more than 1*
  
02 UNP Textures\Catgirl\   ← catgirl textures with almost no fur
  
02 UNP Textures\Furry\   ← furry textures, with fur covering all of her face
  
02 UNP Textures\LowRes\   ← default textures, but scaled down to low resolution (meant for low-end computers)
  
  
*Underwear - only for UNP body, optional (by default she has no underwear), don't choose more than 1*
  
03 Underwear\Light\   ← similar to vanilla underwear, beige color
  
03 Underwear\Dark\   ← dark red bikini, less lore-friendly
  
  
*Face textures* *- optional, for UNP Body and CBBE Body, don't choose more than 1*
  
02 UNP Textures\Face\Both\   ← similar to default texture, with additional fur on cheeks

*Eyes - optional (default are yellow/gold)*
  
05 Eyes\Green\   ← green eyes
  
  
*Body models - optional (default is UNP body)*
  
01 CBBE\   ← CBBE body
  
  
*Hug animation fix*
  
08 HugFix\   ← if you have Unofficial Skyrim Patch, or FNIS, or both, then this is optional
  
  
*Wedding dress texture - optional (default is dark green)*
  
09 MDress\white\   ← white wedding dress texture
  
  
*BAT files - optional*
  
06 Bats\   ← special files that you can run from the in-game console (for example "bat mrtbooks") to get items you'd normally have to gather personally to progress through the quests
  
There are 5 of them:
  
[font=Courier New]BAT MRTtaming[/font] - to get all the items required at the end of The Taming of the Shrew quest
  
[font=Courier New]BAT MRTfood[/font] - to get all the food you're supposed to gather in Feline Solidarity quest
  
[font=Courier New]BAT MRTbooks[/font] - to get all the books required for Knowledge is Power optional quest
  
[font=Courier New]BAT MRTgifts[/font] - to get all the crafting materials for gifts (you need to learn crafting recipes first)
  
[font=Courier New]BAT MRTring[/font] - to get all the crafting materials for the wedding ring (regardless which one you chose)
