![](https://i.imgur.com/F3jxBkY.png)Inalion was born in Valenwood and lost her family at a young age during a trip to Cyrodiil. She was found and raised by warrior monks who wander Tamriel.  These monks are also known as "The Balancers." According to legend they seek to keep the balance between good and evil, law and chaos, and light and dark. She is over one-hundred years old and extremely wise and talented in the art of unarmed fighting. All monks from her order go through a life and death test to determine which element is attuned to their fighting style.  Inalion became a Monk of the Wind Fist at her graduation many years ago. Inalion's mission in Skyrim is to stop the dragon threat and return the region to balance. After that she is to remain stationed in Skyrim and learn more about the rumors of a mysterious being known as The Dragonborn.

Inalion is a Warrior Monk. Her attunement to the Wind Fist technique has increased her speed as well as enhanced her Alteration skills. She fights unarmed and doesn't wear armor in order to increase her mobility. It is recommended that you give her cloth armor and disenchant her default gloves so you can enchant her new gloves with the same unarmed enchantment.
  
**Features:** Essential, won't break stealth, can be married
  
**Skills**
  
Alteration Dual Casting, Unhindered, Magic Resistance, Recovery, Atronach, Respite, Stability, Light Foot, Muffled Movement, Agile Defender, Avoid Death, Alteration Novice-Expert, Skill Boosts, Mage Armor, Wind Walker, and Deft Movement

**Tempest:** 15% chance of a critical hit that does 10 points of critical damage. Critical chance and critical damage are increased when facing enemies in critical health.
