OVERVIEW: Teldryn Dialogue Expansion (TDE) 
  
  
[ 2021-07-24 | version 1.1 ] Update that adds ~210 lines of dialogue that is synthesized from [xVASynth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44184). See below. In total the mod has somewhere between 530 and 550 distinct lines.
  
  
  
[ 2020-11-17 | version 1.0 ] This is a more developed dialogue expansion for Teldryn Sero, rebuilt from Teldryn Sero - Dialogue Expansion SE - Open Ended W.I.P. Project by [Foamimi](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/42417205) (with her permission). The initial mod can be found here --[https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26989](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26989)[size=2]﻿. This does not contain many of the features as intended in the original, such as reactions to player lock picking etc. This mod will mainly location based idles and player triggered dialogue. Almost all dialogue is non-generic and uniquely spliced just for Teldryn. Hopefully it suits his character.

DLC REQUIREMENTS
  
Dawnguard.esm
  
Dragonborn.esm
  
  
INSTALLATION
  
MO2: Install like any other mod. I'm not familiar with other methods or tools.
  
- Enable the mod. Load the game. Make a save. Load that save.
  
- If you see the top level dialogue option "There's something on my mind..." that means the mod is working.
  
  
UNINSTALLATION
  
You can install/uninstall whenever you want, and as many times as you want.
  
  
CK STUFF
  
- This entire mod is currently a single Quest. No scripts, no global variables, no form lists or sharing, etc. And only vanilla assets.
  
  
COMPATIBILITY
  
- Should be compatible with everything.
  
- Should be compatible with [Relationship Dialogue Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1187)
  
- As well as [Undriel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/40453140)'s Teldryn mods.
  
- Load order should not matter

This update (adds ~210 lines) is generated 98% by [xVASynth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44184). It's so cool. I had in mind that I'd never do an update for this mod again, but after messing around on xVASynth, I had to. An important note - Teldryn's vanilla voice is rather smooth. The synthetic lines won't be as butter-like. There is also some static background / robotic like noise that can be heard at certain points. I tried to remove or lessen it in Audacity. If your ears are very delicate and might bleed then I recommend you to not use version 1.1.
  
  
Had tried to draw inspiration from [[Male Dark Elf Responses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvkjmnRRcG4)].
  
  
If you think Teldryn talks too much, maybe this can help: [[link](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38670/)]
  
  
Two videos as preview for the synthesized dialogue:

Huge thank you to [Foamimi](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/42417205) because if it weren't for her and her Teldryn dialogue W.I.P project, this mod wouldn't exist. Also I want to acknowledge a comment on this post [[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/ieovj9/teldryn_sero_dialogue_expansion_tsde_an_open/)] that prompted me to make a synth for the Lute lol since Bethesda does not like their stuff used across games. 
  
  
There are some things I could  not get to work, such as comments when Player Shouts, or actor notice corpse. ~~I also have some trouble adding locations into the conditions, as if it's unnamed, I have no idea how to set it. CK crashes too easily for me to brute force things~~. 
  
  
I did my best to be true to Teldryn's character and lore-friendly and not make anyone's ears bleed but if some dialogue sounds so repetitious or atrocious please, please let me know. Might make a video with all dialogue when I have time.
  
  
And a thank you to these two: [[LazyAudio](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71749)] [[Creation Kit Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20061)]. The dialogue associated with the "player has non-platonic feelings" option was largely inspired by this [writer](https://1000fiction.tumblr.com/).
  
  
*Thank you!* Feedback/comments are welcome. Please let me know of any questions. 
  
  
  
  
  
PLAYER DIALOGUE NOTES (SPOILER)

Added approximately 80 new conditional idles. Also replaced some old ones and decreased the frequency of his comments.
  
  
Added more "Any thoughts?" dialogue responses. Reorganized dialogue - Teldryn's "Not now" should be delayed more.
  
  
Added top level "Tell me about Raven Rock" - when you are in Raven Rock.
  
  
Added an explanation for the lute song (lmk if my lore understanding is a disaster) [main [ref](https://www.imperial-library.info/content/there-explanation-walking-ways) used]
  
  
Added top level "Have you heard of the name Miraak?" - when you are doing the initial ask-around-about-Miraak DLC2 quest. Also added a line or two of dialogue for the DLC2 main quest. Condition should be met at some point before you go off to fight Miraak. This line is added as a "hello" type (ie, talk to him and he will respond with this).
  
  
Mostly this update attempted to focus more on Solstheim and engage more with the lore.
  
  
Added option for Teldryn to read *Nerevar At Red Mountain*. Either the player or Teldryn must have the book in their inventory. I have some trouble with the book reading animation. If Teldryn reads the book while sitting, he won't stop after the dialogue is finished. Ask him to do something else to reset the animation.

Different Player Dialogue can be triggered with following conditions. Talk to him and find out. Or open CK. Sorry, not everything is tested. Relationship rank == 4 is treated equivalent to "married". You can exit (tab out of) dialogue anytime, there are no scripts so it's fine. To "marry" without getting married, use the console to set relationship rank to 4 ("player.setrelationshiprank 04038565 4" without the quotes, and 04038565 should be his Reference ID)
  
  
***There's something on my mind...***
  
... He won't want to talk sometimes. Also depends on weather.
  
  
... Boethiah Quest
  
 ﻿- if player is at that phase where you must sacrifice a follower
  
 ﻿- location is at Boethiah's shrine
  
- Teldryn isn't dumb and you won't be able to sacrifice him.
  
  
  
... Helmet dialogue
  
 ﻿- It is always be available.
  
  
... Teldryn might need something
  
﻿ ﻿- relationship rank == 4
  
 ﻿- time is between 10pm and 2am
  
 ﻿- location is inn or player house
  
  
... Mara amulet
  
 ﻿- relationship rank == 4
  
 ﻿- player has amulet of Mara either in inventory or worn (there's a difference)
  
  
... Lute
  
 ﻿- player or Teldryn has a Lute in inventory
  
 ﻿- or location is Bard's College or Inn
  
 ﻿- and there's no bard playing some song
  
  
... Talk, have a moment?
  
 ﻿- random chance Teldryn will say no, 5 hour reset time for this "no"
  
 ﻿- sorry I had to look up synonyms for what I wanted him to say.
  
  
... Player has non-platonic feelings
  
 ﻿- relationship rank == 3
  
 ﻿- player has amulet of Mara in inventory
  
 ﻿- this option is pretty winding, hopefully your Speech >= 55 (ask to change the topic)
  
 ﻿- this option is sappy I'm not good with this stuff
  
  
... Blacklight dialogue
  
 - In Whiterun or Solitude (iirc)
  
  
... "Any thoughts?"
  
 ﻿- this will trigger something random depending on your location and faction
  
 ﻿- above currently only included for College of Winterhold and Thieves Guild, you need to be archmage
  
 ﻿- depending on the dialogue triggered you have reply options
  
 ﻿- if you're in Raven Rock
  
 ﻿- random dialogue for St. Jiub if you've started or completed that quest. The animation might need fixing. +Bonus if you have the opus in your inventory
  
 ﻿- Teldryn might complain depending on time of day
  
 ﻿- he might have nothing to say though
  
 ﻿- I need more ideas so please give me some ideas if you have any
  
  
  
Always editing this mess of a description to be more concise + relevant (sorry).
