[font=Georgia]*﻿A collaboration between two fans of Skyrim to bring a unique Altmer follower.*[/font][font=Georgia]**MEET TALIESIN.**[/font]![](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/93413/93413-1686793938-1863912644.png)﻿[font=Georgia]﻿[/font]
  
  
[font=Georgia]Every awakening begins after hitting rock-bottom.
  
A once-proud Thalmor soldier with a tragic backstory, Taliesin is more attuned than his peers.  During a routine order to clear out some Talos Worshippers, this Mer has a change of heart and wants out.  But escape can be perilous, and old habits die hard.
  
His truth is cloaked in riddles and innuendos.  Getting him to open up will take some work.
  
Perhaps having an ex-Thalmor in your pocket could be beneficial?[/font][font=Georgia]
  
  
You'll find him at a hidden statue of Talos near **Lake Illinalta**.
  
  
Forgot a health potion?  No worries. 
  
Poor fool forgot he has a pack right next to him with one in it.
  
Surely this bodes well for your journey together...

WHERE TO FIND HIM:

﻿Taliesin will tell you he led a contingent of Thalmor to a Talos shrine just south of Lake Ilinalta. 
  
The plan was to give a speech and persuade the worshipers to abandon Talos.
  
What happened next surprised him.
  
You'll find Taliesin clinging on for dear life among the remains of the skirmish.
  
  
He puts up a front at first.  Be on the lookout for some notes and a journal for clues about who he is.

[/font]**[font=Georgia]A Word from Tally's Voice Actor
  
(and Co-Author):

[font=Georgia]Villains, heroes, and allies have one thing in common: they are born, not made. 
  
Many of Taliesin's monologues and quips are inspired by true events.  On my journey, I have felt the world around me lacking in empathy and compassion.  Men are discouraged from talking about their feelings; it is my mission to tap into that oft suppressed vulnerability.  Without safe spaces, we become bitter.  That bitterness poisons us from within and radiates throughout.  
  
  
The only solution is community.
  
Recent events in the world have made many people fearful of living authentically.
  
The work DynamiteGal and I do has always been, and will continue to be a safe space for everyone.
  
H[/font][font=Georgia]ATE HAS NO PLACE HERE.
  
 
  
  
[/font][font=Georgia]Grateful for you all. 
  
And more importantly, I'm grateful for DynamiteGal for giving me space to share my story in her mod.
  
  
Now go out there and slay!

[/font][font=Georgia]**Romance:**[/font]
  
Spoiler
  
[font=Georgia]Right now, Taliesin's romance is in its barebones form right now as we experiment with handling his relationship with the player. In future updates, we'll be added more content depending on how the player decides their relationship with Taliesin; be it as a romantic partner, a brother figure, or to remain platonic.
  
As tradition in Skyrim, slap on an Amulet of Mara and talk with him after his 1st reaction to the amulet plays out.
  
Despite his upbringing in the Dominion, Taliesin cares nothing about race or gender.[/font]

[font=Georgia]**PLEASE NOTE:**
  
Taliesin's bodyshape and skin textures will differ on what mods you are using for your vanilla NPCs.
  
He is 100% vanilla (Hair excluded) and may appear different.[/font]
