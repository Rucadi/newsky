**A pirate-themed adventure as much as a follower mod, Val Serano is a custom male follower with over 4,500 lines of dialogue performed by Krimson Graey. Val's story and optional romance span over a dozen new quests, include a large cast of new characters and familiar faces with well over 1,000 fully voice-acted and carefully spliced lines, and add new dungeons, locations, and treasures to collect while exploring themes of friendship, betrayal, love, and the cost of ambition. The adventure begins by looting the message in a bottle at White River Watch!****PLEASE READ THE [[b]FAQ](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/6107)**﻿[/b]

Val faces the world with his wits at the ready, and while he'd rather charm his way out of a conflict he won't back down from a fight. His trust is not easily won, but once it's yours he'll adventure at your side as your friend (and optionally your lover). He's quite comfortable navigating the underworld of Tamriel and darker quests, but Val has a unique moral compass from his upbringing among Dunmer. You may discover he doesn't always agree with you for some unusual reasons as you adventure together. He's his own master who takes suggestions rather than blindly following orders. Besides, you'll soon discover that he has his own problems to solve.
  
  
His quest commentary is extensive (see the Articles tab for a [detailed list](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/5970)). For simple quests Val might have just a line or two. For more detailed quests, he is fully interactive and engaged with custom behaviors, reactions, optional side quests, and thoughtful conversations. Quest coverage includes: Spoiler

This is a lore-friendly mod, but sticklers may notice that I took some creative license with a few things. I hope we've done this in a way which highlights Val's character and lifestyle but still makes him feel like part of the world of the Elder Scrolls. Contains mature themes and swearing roughly in-line with vanilla Skyrim.
  
  
**Val was written straight from the heart, and we hope you enjoy adventuring with him.**[/size]

SpoilerVal is an unreliable narrator who will lie by omission to the player shortly after your first meeting. Over the course of his personal story, you will uncover the truth behind the lies and evaluate what it means for your friendship. Val has seven main quests which cover his three-act character arc, and twelve optional quests which mostly cover the three-act romance arc, but also handle acquiring his horse, coffee, becoming a mage, and a small quest for a "just friends" playthrough. 
  
  
This is first and foremost a roleplaying mod, so players have three dialogue options to respond to most conversations:
  

  
1. The Innocent: a good-natured character who hopes Val will mend his ways;
The Kindred Spirit: a fellow rogue who is on board for the adventure; or
  
2. The Rival: a skeptic who is going to challenge Val every step of the way.

You don't have to commit to a specific response path and can freely mix and match without getting locked out of any quest events, but you will hear different responses from Val as he reacts to your character roleplay choices. Sometimes your speechcraft skill or relationship status with Val will also influence the outcome. Val remembers what you tell him, and he may respond accordingly in subsequent conversations.
  
  
Val's summon spell is taught narratively via the Skyrim Main Quest just before you go to Skuldafn, but if you aren't doing the main quest, you can pick up the book in the strongbox "Val's Bug Out Box" near the chest with the Star of Solitude. You should not "need" it, as he's got mechanisms to catch up to you if he gets stuck or falls behind. Same with his horse; just mount up and Windward will find you.
  
  
You will automatically get a lesser power (Bosun's Whistle) which will reset Val if he gets stuck. If his outfit doesn't look right, it will cause him to re-evaluate his wardrobe choices. It will attempt to stop combat if he, or anyone else, gets into a brawl over friendly fire. It will also trigger his catch-up mechanism if he's too far away from you. This is not intended to be a replacement for his summon spell; more insurance against some terrain being difficult for followers to navigate and when Skyrim "Just Works(tm)."

SpoilerDO NOT IMPORT VAL INTO ANY FOLLOWER FRAMEWORKS OR YOU WILL BREAK HIM.
  
  
Val runs on a detailed, custom follower framework:
  

  
* Vanquishes your enemies with lightning spells, one-handed sword, and/or crossbow. Learns new spells during your adventures. Summonable.
Aids and abets criminal activities! Stealthy, doesn't set off traps, doesn't care about crime. Skilled lockpick, situational pickpocket. Sometimes he will offer to use his skills to help you complete certain quests.
  
* Custom horse and riding framework.
Will sleep in player-useable beds and rented inn double beds. Complains if you wake him up early.
  
* Idle comments on a bunch of stuff: ﻿Locations, time of day, weather, spell casting, doing favors, being woken up when he wants to sleep, and his clothing or lack thereof.
Most idles muted when sneaking, speaks quietly when you talk to him.
  
* Quest-aware dialogue and commentary (full list in Articles). Ask him about cities, some towns, your homes, the joinable factions.
No easily missed dialogue. Val will speak automatically to prompt you to click on him and talk when he has something more extensive to say in response to a particular quest stage.
  
* No key story or quest dialogue said during NPC dialogue.
Automatically gets himself out of the way during important cutscenes.
  
* Remembers your conversations and adventures, dynamic dialogue changes depending on your interactions.
Reactions to helpful player spells.
  
* Compatible with alternate starts and non-Dragonborn playthroughs.

Follower control functions are under the dialogue topic, "Hey, Val-" or the sneaking-specific menu, "Psst, Val-"
  

  
* Sandboxes in a small area when he gets bored waiting, which is immediately.
He will sit still in a chair indefinitely if asked nicely; Don't forget to tell him to get up again.
  
* He has a special sneaking wait where he will stay in once spot quietly.
Tell him where to live when you dismiss him (unlocked through his personal questline).
  
* Ask him to pick locked doors and chests with a custom mechanic.
Find on the map wherever the heck you left him.
  
* Casts/dispels his candlelight spell when you ask. Auto-dispels during stealth.
Ask him to lead you to a carriage or ferry.
  
* Change his outfit or dress him yourself (unlocked through his personal questline).
Ask for a hug once you're good friends (special animations if using **I'm Glad You're Here**).
  
* Pronoun selection (Val uses the character's sex from character creation by default).
Call you by name - pick from a limited list of player names.
  
* Adjust his following distance (near and far options).
Adjust the amount of damage he does.
  
* Adjust his combat style (mage unlocked through his personal questline & College of Winterhold).
Put things in his inventory or separate backpack (discovered through his personal questline, other backpacks supported via Addon selection).
  

Some additional follower controls are unlocked under the topic, "Hey, handsome-" through romance quest milestones.
  

  
* Ask for a kiss (special animations if using **A Skyrim Kiss** and/or **OStim Community Resource/OARE**)
Tell him you love him.
  
* Take a bath.
Flirty banter.
  

I will be providing ongoing support to improve Val's features, and feedback is welcome.

*Story*
  
SpoilerThere is no need to rush to get Val prior to getting out of Helgen or telling Jarl Balgruuf about Helgen. He does not comment on these quest events, and I've intended that once you get to Whiterun you can quickly go to White River Watch to start Val's first quest, *Between the Daedra and the Deep Blue Sea*. Loot the message in a bottle that's sitting on a crate outside (see images for exact location). Val is compatible with non-Helgen starts as well as not-being-the-Dragonborn playthroughs, and you can get his first quest right away as soon as you're settled. From there, you can take the carriage to either Solitude, Dawnstar, or Windhelm for the next step. See the Articles tab for a full walkthrough.
  
  
*Romance*
  
SpoilerVal is optionally romanceable by any and all characters. There is an early date in Solitude available right after you leave Radiant Raiment during *He Runs a Tight Shipwreck*. The main romance questline becomes available once you've become close friends at the conclusion of *Stand by Me* and waited two hours in-game to get some separation from a difficult conversation. Start by asking him if he ever thinks about the two of you, and he will follow your lead. You can remove all future romance dialogue by choosing ALL CAPS options from a variety of romance quests, otherwise all dialogue options continue various paths through the romance content. The romance has three paths:
  
  

  
* Innocent - straightforward, two people gradually growing closer
Kindred Spirit - steamy, deals with a growing emotional bond after an impulsive night
  
* Rival - a few misunderstandings lead to drama, and sparks eventually lead to fire

Innocent is just that, and nothing physically intimate is ever implied. For Kindred Spirit and Rival paths, a kiss or physical intimacy is implied a handful of times where it fits in the story and is handled with a fade-to-black-screen so exactly what transpires is up to you. There is nothing explicit in this mod, but Val will flirt to different degrees depending on your relationship path and status.
  
  
You will eventually have to commit to a specific path (you are there when you equip the Amulet of Dibella), and you can ultimately choose whether you and Val experience happily-ever-after or heartbreak. Heartbreak is irreversible and Val will hold this against you for a time in game time, so choose carefully and save your game before making major decisions. You can turn down Val's marriage proposal and remain lovers (ALL CAPS option). Adopting a child is a further optional quest that you can decide to do or opt out of through a conversation with Val after becoming engaged. See the Articles tab for a full walkthrough.
