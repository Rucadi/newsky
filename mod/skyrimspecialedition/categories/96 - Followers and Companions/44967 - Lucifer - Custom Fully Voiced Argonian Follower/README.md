Overview**

Lucifer is a custom voiced Argonian follower with over 6000+ lines of dialogue. Despite his goofy nature and unnatural voice for an Argonian, he is a skilled archer and fighter and will follow you whether you go. He will listen to your commands unless he feels that it isn't the right thing to do. Try and ask him about his past and he may or may not share any. Continue to make yourself the hero, anti-hero or villain of Skyrim and he will trust you more... or is that what someone wants him to do? Gain his trust and he will share what he knows about himself as he doesn't know who he really is, even though he may disagree with some of your actions, he won't leave your side.
