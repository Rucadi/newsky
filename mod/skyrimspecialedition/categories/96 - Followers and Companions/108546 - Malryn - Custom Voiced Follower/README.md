**Description:**
  
Malryn is an accomplished spellsword and summoner with ~3500ish lines. New to Skyrim and its culture, she's eager to make her mark on the world with whomever she can convince to be her adventuring partner. She can be found in the Winking Skeever Inn in Solitude. Malryn brings a unique perspective to your adventures and will be sure to tell you all about it. She'll try her best to be polite, but sometimes things just need to be said.

**Features:**
  
**Highly Reactive Regard System**
  
 Your choices have impact and will change how Malryn feels about you over time - and not always in the ways you might expect. How she feels about you can result in different quest responses, different pathways, and generally different banter. 
  
  
**Camping System**
  
 If you ask Mal to camp around a tent or a campfire (including the campfire from the mod Campfire) she will go into camping mode. Here you have stories and songs available to you as well as a more relaxed atmosphere.
  
  
 **Intriguing Storyline**
  
 I'm biased because I wrote it, but I like it. Mal starts out trying to be the "perfect" adventurer. How she grows from this is largely up to your decisions throughout the game and what the two of you run into during your adventures. As part of that, when you first meet her your game will auto select a few different options that will allow you to find out more about her past. I hope this helps keep things fresh when different quests can have different outcomes depending on your game.
  
  
**Someone To Snoop Through Your Journal**
  
 Only if you let her though. Ever had that moment where your quest journal is too overwhelming to figure out what to do next? Let Malryn have a peak and have her give you an idea of what to do for the day. This will also tend to point you towards quests she has commentary on if you want a more immersive way to find them. 
  
  
**FAQ:**
  

  
* **Can I install on a previous save?**
    
  You can, but she'll have the usual follower bugs. Meaning she'll try to "catch up" to wherever you are on your quests in her commentary and might say weird things at weird times.
**Can I uninstall midplaythough?**
  
Don't do that.* **Where is she?**
    
  She's in the Winking Skeever in Solitude. Right upstairs on the balcony.
**Can I use follower manager mods on her?**
  
ABSOULTELY NOT. Mal is on a custom follower framework and being integrated onto anything that messes with her AI will break her. AFT is a no no for custom follower mods, NFF can be used, but for the love of Mara, give your custom followers tokens so it ignores them.* **Who voices Malryn?**
    
  That would be me.
**Malryn is acting...strange.**
  
Is she? Huh.* **What mods does she interact with?**

**What followers does she have banter with?**

**Notes:**I made Malryn with the idea of a follower who isn't totally forthcoming with the player when they first meet. I wanted her to react dynamically with the world around her and more importantly with the player's choices. This is my first mod and my first iteration of Malryn, so she's still far from complete. Let me know what you think!
