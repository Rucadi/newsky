***Backstory: Jennifer***[font=Söhne, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, Ubuntu, Cantarell, Noto Sans, sans-serif, Helvetica Neue, Arial, Apple Color Emoji, Segoe UI Emoji, Segoe UI Symbol, Noto Color Emoji] ***was born into a family of Imperial soldiers in the heart of Cyrodiil. From a young age, she was trained in combat and military strategy, instilled with the values of duty, honor, and loyalty to the Empire. Her family had a long history of serving the Emperor, dating back to the founding days of the Septim Dynasty.***[/font][font=Söhne, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, Ubuntu, Cantarell, Noto Sans, sans-serif, Helvetica Neue, Arial, Apple Color Emoji, Segoe UI Emoji, Segoe UI Symbol, Noto Color Emoji][/font][font=Söhne, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, Ubuntu, Cantarell, Noto Sans, sans-serif, Helvetica Neue, Arial, Apple Color Emoji, Segoe UI Emoji, Segoe UI Symbol, Noto Color Emoji]***As Jennifer grew older, she showed exceptional talent in swordsmanship and leadership. She quickly rose through the ranks of the Imperial Legion, earning respect and recognition for her bravery and tactical prowess on the battlefield. Her unwavering dedication to the Empire and her fellow soldiers made her a natural leader, and she was soon appointed as a captain, leading campaigns against bandits, rebels, and threats to Imperial territories.***[/font][font=Söhne, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, Ubuntu, Cantarell, Noto Sans, sans-serif, Helvetica Neue, Arial, Apple Color Emoji, Segoe UI Emoji, Segoe UI Symbol, Noto Color Emoji][/font][font=Söhne, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, Ubuntu, Cantarell, Noto Sans, sans-serif, Helvetica Neue, Arial, Apple Color Emoji, Segoe UI Emoji, Segoe UI Symbol, Noto Color Emoji]***During one particularly dangerous mission in Skyrim, Jennifer's unit was ambushed by a group of Forsworn rebels near Markarth. In the chaos of battle, she was separated from her comrades and left for dead. Miraculously, she survived and was rescued by a passing group of adventurers.***[/font][font=Söhne, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, Ubuntu, Cantarell, Noto Sans, sans-serif, Helvetica Neue, Arial, Apple Color Emoji, Segoe UI Emoji, Segoe UI Symbol, Noto Color Emoji][/font][font=Söhne, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, Ubuntu, Cantarell, Noto Sans, sans-serif, Helvetica Neue, Arial, Apple Color Emoji, Segoe UI Emoji, Segoe UI Symbol, Noto Color Emoji]***Grateful for her rescue and impressed by their skills, Jennifer decided to join forces with the adventurers, seeing an opportunity to continue serving the Empire by aiding its citizens directly. Over time, she became a trusted companion, using her combat expertise and knowledge of Imperial tactics to assist the group in their quests across Skyrim.***[/font][font=Söhne, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, Ubuntu, Cantarell, Noto Sans, sans-serif, Helvetica Neue, Arial, Apple Color Emoji, Segoe UI Emoji, Segoe UI Symbol, Noto Color Emoji][/font][font=Söhne, ui-sans-serif, system-ui, -apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, Ubuntu, Cantarell, Noto Sans, sans-serif, Helvetica Neue, Arial, Apple Color Emoji, Segoe UI Emoji, Segoe UI Symbol, Noto Color Emoji]***Despite her strong ties to the Empire, Jennifer is open-minded and respectful of Skyrim's diverse cultures and beliefs. She values justice and fairness above all else, always striving to protect the innocent and uphold the principles of honor and integrity.***[/font]
  
***Hi I present you Jennifer, she comes in a fomod version that allows you to choose between default version, CBBE with custom body and textures and Asset version if you have several of my followers and want to save disk space (shared assets).
  
  
Warning: the most faithful version is CBBE 3BA version, default version uses your textures and body so I don't guarantee the same look, asset version is the second in order.**

A: Generally you'll need a mod manager, if manually just uncompress and mix meshes/textures shared folder and one of the main mehes/textures folder (01:default, 02: CBBE or 03:asset), once you've done that you'll have Meshes-Textures-follower.esp, then compress and install.

Q: Can you change the follower to  my taste?

A: Often no, I see nobody give the options I offer and I don't see you complaining there, maybe I will have it in mind for next ones.
  
  
Q: What is an ESP-FE (ESL)?
  
A: Skyrim only allows 256 plugins, with this plugin format this will not count in your load order
  
  
Q: How I change her textures and body?
  
A: Just look at the textures and meshes folder once there you'll find [ (name of the follower) body ], go there and open body folder and replace the files
  
  
Q: It's not lore friendly
  
A: I enjoy doing both type of followers, immersive and just for fun, please relax and accept you can't control all in life, will be good for your heart )))
