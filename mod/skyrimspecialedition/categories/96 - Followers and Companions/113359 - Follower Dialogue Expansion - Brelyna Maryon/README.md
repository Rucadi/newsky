This mod is part of my series to renovate vanilla characters with additional depth, unique history or personality, and immersive and detailed interaction.
  
  
  
*"**Just because I come from House Telvanni, doesn't automatically make me a prodigy. I wish my parents understood that."*
  
  
  
**How is Brelyna envisioned and touched on in this mod:**
  
  
In this mod, Brelyna is expanded as an aspiring mage who strives to become a Conjuration master - **not out of love for magic, but to satisfy her parents' demands** and prove herself a worthy heir to her prestigious Telvanni family. She is envisioned as the "rich College nerdy sweetheart."
  
  
Brelyna suffers from **constant stress due to her family's high expectations,** but she grits her teeth and presses on. Though she has a genuine interest in magic, the weight of her family's legacy **threatens to crush the joy** she finds in her studies.
  
  
However, like many College students of her age, she has some hobbies to make life more bearable, including singing and songwriting. While she wouldn't sing in this mod, she would tell you something about it.
  
  
As a child from House Telvanni, Brelyna also holds great respect for Neloth, who is one of her relatives. She perceives Neloth as the absolute role model of the Telvanni, and you'll soon find out if you travel with her to Solstheim.
  
  
Will you help Brelyna achieve what her family expects of her, or will you **guide her to find her own happiness in the cold lands of Skyrim?**
  
  
You can recruit her after completing the quest "Brelyna's Practice".
  
  
In the mod, Brelyna has a **sweet, nerdy demeanor,** who despite her family's pressure tries to make the most out of her time in Skyrim.
