**SOMEWHERE ON HLAALU FARM....**
  
Is a new little creature freshly shipped from Bal Foyen.
  
Scratching at the ground, this oddly pink little guar wonders amongst the chickens and hoping for someone to come rescue her!
  
Maybe a curious stranger would be interested in taking her on some adventures?
  
  
Experimented on by her Hlaalu master wizard, Squelch is an Argonian-turned-Bantam Guar!
  
Save her from Hlaalu farm and she'll follow you around Skyrim as fast as her chubby legs can move! Squelch won't fight in combat but she will hold your stuff!
  
She is aware of when the player is sneaking and has unique interactions to engage with her!
  
You can feed her snacks, give her head pets, and ask her many things such as her thoughts, feelings, & memories!
  
Oh yeah... she *really* likes crickets!
