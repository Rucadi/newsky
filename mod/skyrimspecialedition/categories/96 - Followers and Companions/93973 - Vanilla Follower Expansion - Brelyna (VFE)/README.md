**Vanilla Follower Expansion - Brelyna**
  
This mod adds new lines to Brelyna, the new student and the College of Winterhold.
  
  
**Overview**
  
This mod adds ~100 new lines of dialogue to Brelyna, generated with Elevenlabs AI voice cloning (see "videos" tab for an example). She's a new to the College, and Skyrim as a whole. She'll make a few comments on cities, dungeons and other locations. 100% lore-friendly (but not canon)!
  
  
You will be able to access the new lines once you have completed her quest "Brelyna's Practice", and have recruited her as your follower.
  
  
What this mod does:
  

  
* Add idle dialogue to Brelyna
Add backstory to Brelyna
  
* Integrate into the vanilla follower system
Expand a tiiiiiiiny bit on her romance
  

  
What this mod does not do:
  

  
* Turn her into a "super-follower" à la Inigo, Lucien, Remiel, etc.
Add any new follower mechanics
  
* Edit her appearance (the screenshot is from [Nordic Faces](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40658)﻿)

  
**Requirements**
  

  
* Skyrim SE/AE (should be compatible with both)

  
**Compatibility**
  
This mod will only conflict with a mod that removes or replaces Brelyna's reference object. I don't know of any mods that do this, so afaik this mod is 100% compatible with everything without a patch.
  
**Bugs**
  
If you notice a spelling error, font bug (aka a square in the subtitles) or other bug, please report it in the bugs section. English *is* my first language, I'm just an idiot.
  
**Installation**
  
Drag and drop into your favorite mod manager. Load order not important. Safe to install mid game.
  
  
**Uninstallation**
  
Disable the mod and cross your fingers. I am not liable for any save corruption.
