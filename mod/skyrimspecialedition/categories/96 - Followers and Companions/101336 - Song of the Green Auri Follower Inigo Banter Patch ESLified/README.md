I've just ESLified the Inigo banter patch for her since she stated in her comments she didn't know how to do it on her own. Don't update from the ESP to ESL version mid-game, as this may cause issues.
  
  
Waribiki is welcome to take this file and upload it on her own page, and I'll remove this. Or for any other reason if she wants this taken down I will.
  
  
 I just wanted to upload a working ESLified esp + voice files for anyone who doesn't know how to properly ESL mods on their own.
