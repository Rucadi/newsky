This mod is part of my series to renovate vanilla characters with additional depth, unique history or personality, and immersive and detailed interaction.
  
  
  
*"I'm sure they're already writing songs about your spoils. That day will come for me yet. Some day..."*
  
  
  
**How is Erik envisioned and touched on in this mod:**
  
  
In this mod, Erik is **expanded as a young, untested farmer with dreams of becoming a famous adventurer.** He longs to be recognized as a hero, but first, he must earn the approval of his father - a retired war hero who wants nothing more than a peaceful life for his son.
  
  
Erik grew up in Rorikstead, inspired by his father's tales of bravery during the Great War. However, his father disapproves of his desire to follow in his footsteps, fearing the dangers of a warrior's life. With the player's help, Erik can persuade his father to let him pursue his dreams.
  
  
Once free, Erik begins his journey as a mercenary, **fighting by your side to gain experience and prove himself.** He dreams of one day traveling to Hammerfell, captivated by its exotic tales, architecture, and landscapes. For now, though, he is content to **learn from you and grow as a warrior.**
  
  
Erik is also deeply inspired by the legends of Jorrvaskr and the Companions. **In this mod, you can help him achieve his dream of joining their ranks!**
  
  
**Will you help Erik become the warrior he is meant to be?**
  
  
In the mod, Erik has an **energetic and enthusiastic demeanor,** eager to prove himself and partake in legendary adventures. Though the world is strange and new to him, he is ready to learn and grow with your guidance.
