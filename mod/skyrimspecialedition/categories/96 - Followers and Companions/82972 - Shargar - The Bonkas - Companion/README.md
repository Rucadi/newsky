Shargar The Bonkas - formerly known as Shargar The Ooogar Bahonkas - is a young Orc lady famous for her
  
uncommon exotic beauty rarely seen among other orcs. For that reason, she attracts men and mers alike. 
  
  
Like all other orsimer ladies born and raised in a stronghold, she was destined to be married to an orc chief, 
  
But such fate is not what Shargar wanted, so she left her home in search of adventures.
  
  
Shargar doesn't fond of people looking at her with a lustful eye, hence she armed herself with the
  
Almighty Horny Bonker - An unique club type weapon that does increased damage against other dudes.

Some additional info:
  
  

  
* She is an Orc.
She is essential and marriageable
  
* She has 100 weight.
She is specialized in Two-handed, light armor and blocking.
  
* She is at Dawnstar - Windpeak Inn
All screenshots were taken on BHUNP version.
  
* Her outfit are from vanilla assets, if you have mod to alternate them, she will have whatever you installed.
This mod is compatible with both BHUNP and 3BA version of the [Asset Hub](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80819)﻿.
  
* Be nice to her.
Don't take away her bonk stick. Why would you?
  
* She is quite bonker when it come to combat performance.
    
  It's quite hilarious to see her bonking away so I leave it like that.
