Smashly's MHiYH V3.1 with MCM - MHiYH adds a daily and Nightly AI Scheduling for Followers and NPC's to Volek's original MHiYH - Plus:

Smashly has optimized the Original Scripts and code.
  
MHiYH v3.1 will also show up in Followers Dialog more reliably then Original 1.21
  
  
•They will wander around, eat, sleep, use furniture and tools.
  
•You can assign guard/sleep/work areas for up to 250 followers. The assigned area can be anywhere, they will change locations to reach.
  
•You can fast-travel to any follower's home if you talk to them while they are following.
  
•Compatible with most, if not all Follower Management MODs or Vanilla, and Spouses Can Live Everywhere
  
•Supports custom followers

COMPATABLE WITH: with AFT, EFF, UFO, FLP, SMF or Vanilla -
  
and perhaps all other Follower Management MODs not tested -

HOW TO = To put your Follower on a MHiYH Schedule:
  
  
-1- When in main living area of Home or most any Skyrim location, in Followers Dialog " [Lets talk about Home...] " then chose
  
 [This is your new Home]
  
  
-2- Bring Follower near the Bed you want them to sleep in, then :
  
[ Lets talk about Home... ] then, [ About this particular Area ] then, [ You may sleep in this area during the Night ]
  
 = 10pm to 6am ( or set day )
  
  
-3- Walk the Follower to a work area ( Example: Around that homes exterior or interior - Even a fair distance from home )
  
 [ Lets talk about Home... ] then, [ About this particular Area ] then, [ You may work here during the Day ] = 9am to 5pm ( or set night )
  
Dismiss Follower and That's it ![](http://forums.nexusmods.com/public/style_emoticons/dark/wink.gif)
  
  
Regain Follower following with [Follow me]
  
  
To cancel MHiYH on that Follower use Dialog [You don't like your home] or MCM
  
= = = = = = = = =
  
  
After MHiYH is set. then dismiss Follower to go on MHiYH scheduled AI with:
  
Vanilla = Dismiss Follower
  
AFT = (Dismiss, hang out here)
  
FLP = ( Go Home, I will call you when I need you)
  
EFF= MHYH's home sandbox overrides EFF's residence sandbox, but not immediately.
  
SMF = Dismiss Follower
  
UFO = •It may happen that your dismissed followers will walk towards their original home before MHiYH overrides the UFO home sandbox. They should turn around after a while and go to the home you gave them.
  
  
= = = = = = = = =
  
Known Issues:
  
•If you want to play any Dawnguard quest that involves Serana, it is strongly advised to unregister her before continuing (tell her she may go wherever she likes).
  
•Followers guarding an area might not always react to incoming threats, unless they are attacked.
  
•Followers guarding an area might attack friendly people. Save your game before using the guard order!
  
- Vilja has setting for her own Home, do not set MHiYH for Vilja.
  
- iNPC Followers have been totally fine. ( We are still testing iNPC when questing, no issues yet )
  
- Some MODs like Inconsequential NPCs may have a (Quest Priority ) above that of MHiYH ( Experiment :)
