**Acquiring**

  
* Offers Karliah as an enhanced, improved follower once the Thieves Guild questline has completed, up to returning the skeleton key (Darkness Returns). You do not need to become guild master via the remaining quests to unlock her. You can use this mod whether you have completed the quest or haven't started it yet.
Darkness Returns is a vanilla quest that is part of a long quest chain for the Thieves Guild in Riften. After the quest is complete, you may find Karliah in Nightingale Hall, if you have completed this long ago.
  
* The MCM is locked and mostly greyed out until you have completed Darkness Returns.
Please note that there is a way provided in the mod to re-acquire the Skeleton Key if this influences your decision to complete the required quest or use Nether's Karliah.
  
* Yes, I realize the quest chain is fairly long for the Thieves Guild but requiring Darkness Returns is the safest bet. This requires the least amount of edits and should help to make it compatible with more mods.

  
**Appearance, General**

  
* **ONLY applies if using Nether's Karliah option in installer.**
Modernizes but keeps the aesthetic style of Karliah.
  
* Scultped face, customized face overlay, sculpted hair tresses.
Includes face, brow and eye textures. Eye textures are custom edited.
  
* Option for purple eyes with dark or light sclera (eyewhite).
Includes head and body maps (UNP and CBBE based bodies). Attention to seams between body parts.
  
* Body Maps are customized from the original resource.
Karliah was originally given a weight of 0 in the vanilla game. This has been raised to 32. The character will automatically be updated in your existing game by script magic.
  

  
**Appearance, Outfit**

  
* Karliah's Thieves Guild and Nightingale outfits are offered without hoods (the Nightingale hood is added to inventory and is player accessible. No I don't care about the thieves hood, it gets replaced eventually).

  
**Personality and Interaction**

  
* Karliah has around 300 customized voice lines, generated using xVASynth tool for Skyrim, tweaked for sound quality and brightness.
Relationship system that introduces new lines as she gets to know you better. Starts at Friendly and progresses to Interested and Enamored. At Enamored, can marry Karliah. Each "level" is based on a point system. Just spending time gets you around 100 points a day. There are bonus points that can be awarded during combat (once per hour). Takes around 500 points, total, to get to enamored. Must be a follower to generate relationship.
  
* About Gallus and Marriage: Eventually, Karliah is able to move on and allow you a place in her heart and eventually she is impressed and fond enough of you to marry you, if you choose. That's how I'm framing it, anyways. Don't marry her, if you don't want to.
Marriage and vanilla hearthfire locations are supported. There are currently no adopted children lines and creation club homes (SSE) are not supported.
  
* Location aware: Comment lines trigger when entering a city/town exteriors, dungeon interiors, inn interiors and landmark interiors (guild locations, temples and similar).
Outside location, danger and impressive sight lines are included.
  
* Quest aware: Comments that involve points certain game quests. Companions, Winterhold College, Civil War, Dark Brotherhood, for now. There are also general fill-in comments and lines for other parts of the game.
Player condition aware: Can comment when the player is sick, has lycanthropy or is a vampire (and stage of vampirism) and similar.
  
* Karliah can tell you when she is out of arrows or doesn't have a bow.
Player action aware: Can comment when the player loots loose items in the world, loots bodies, loots treasure chests, collides with her and so on.
  
* Many general idles lines that can be said nearly anywhere. This includes commenting in dungeons, about the weather, about the player or a location, and similar.
Expanded general lines such as seeing wonderous sight, feeling danger, healing her, casting spells on her, hellos, goodbyes and so on.
  
* Additional lines for common follower interaction, such as recruit, dismiss, trade, wait and follow.
Built in ability to hide lines that the player has already read when talking to Karliah. These pertain to the Nightingales, Nocturnal and Gallus. Read to the end of the conversation at least once and these shouldn't show up again. Removes dialogue clutter.

**Gameplay - Combat**

  
* Karliah is a very skilled thief. Her vanilla skills show a high proficiency in using armor, sneaking and using one-handed and ranged weapons. The combat style and perks were modified to reflect more of an urban ranger-style character, with a greater emphasis on bow use.
Combat Style: Ranged is heavily weighted but she will engage in melee from time to time. Increased offense rating.
  
* Class changes: Lowed stealth slightly, increased alchemy (to reflect her ability to create concoctions).
Perks: Lightfoot, Powershot, Ranger, Overdraw 3, Quickshot, Silence, Stealth 5, Armsman 3, Shield Wall 2.
  
* Improved Heath, Stamina, Magicka (latter is added if you want to teach her support spells via other mods). Increased movement speed to 125.
Levels with the player, indefinitely.
  

  
**Gameplay - New Combat Abilities**

  
* **Poison** application. Karliah can apply poison to her weapons, which does 5 damage per second for 3 seconds. This is equivalent to weaker Falmer poison. Is applied to any weapon she uses (ranged or not). Applies in addition to any other weapon effects. She cannot poision mechanicals or ghosts.
Poison **scaling**. Karliah is always improving her concoctions, allowing her to distill stronger poison at higher levels. Poison increases by 1 at levels 15, 25, 35, 45 and 55 (up to +5 poison).
  
* **Quickness** - Karliah can move around faster during combat, increasing her movement speed by 50.
**Slip into Shadow**. When injured, Karliah can slip into the shadows, becoming invisible (up to 12 seconds unless attacking) and healing herself for 25% of her health (plus 110 points) and 50 stamina. Can only occur once per 10 seconds and only if significantly injured. Eye bugfix: Eyes are redrawn when she leaves stealth.
  
* **Vital Strike** (Finishing move). Karliah has a chance to paralyze severely injured opponents, exploiting their weaknesses. Has a chance to happen to a target that is at third health or less. Does not work on dragons or opponents immune to paralysis. Can use any weapon.
**Surprise Attack** (Opening move). A quick, strong attack that can surprise an opponent. Only affects opponents near full health. Does 8 additional damage and staggers them, with a 25% chance to knock them down.
  
* **Hold the Line**: Karliah's arrows often slow enemies.
Ability chance for Vital Strike, Surprise Attack and Hold the Line is 65% as they usually have other conditions. You can adjust this in the MCM menu.
  
* These combat abilities are strong but Archers tend to have misses along with obstacle and positioning requirements, making them generally less effective than casters.

  
**Gameplay - General**

  
* **Concoctions**: Karliah regularly improves and experiments with elixirs, salves and poisons. If you are diseased, sometimes she has a cure available. She can occasionally offer extra poisons, health or stamina potions. Once every 3 days, in game. There is a dialogue when this is available and she will generally let you know in idles.
**Alchemy Expertise** - Karliah can assist when the player is crafting potions, sometimes producing extra crafted materials due to efficiency and technique (23% chance). Must be a follower. Karliah will attempt to walk to the crafting area and assist or advise (just an extra visual touch).
  
* **Simple Outfit System**. You can change her default outfit into anything you want. Just talk to her about her outfit. Drop the items you want her to wear in the Custom Outfit side and she will change into that outfit. You can restore her Skaal armor at any time. Be sure to remove any wearable items before creating a new outfit. Creating an "empty" outfit tells the system you've changed your mind and does not apply a change.
**Unlimited Storage System**. Now she can pack mule her stuff and it's a safe place to put wearable items that you don't want the outfit system to accidentally affect.
  
* **Home System**. You can set her to live practically anywhere. Supports Day (6am to 2pm), Evening (2pm to 10pm) and Night (10pm to 6am) locations. When first used, all 3 time/locations are set to where Karliah is currently standing. From there you can set different day, evening and night locations. You can also set her to sleep at day, evening or night. Removing locations will clear all locations and times so that you can start over. Any entry that shows "Tamriel" means that the location is not defined in game, so this is a catch-all word.
All gameplay dialogues end with "\*" to distinguish them from vanilla and other modded dialogues.
  

  
**The Skeleton Key**

  
* The player is able to retrieve the Skeleton Key. Must be in Sepulcher with Karliah as a follower. Talk to her and you can take or give back the Skeleton Key.
Has detrimental effects over time. After first 24 hours, you lose your Nocturnal Agent ability and cannot switch to a new one. 24 hours later, the guild is having difficulties, increasing buying prices by 10% and reducing sell prices by 10% when dealing with any Thieves Guild member. Returning the key will reverse the process under the same time contraints (takes 24 hours to restore the guild, additional 12 hours to restore Agent ability).
  

  
**Integration**

  
* **NFF**: If using Nether's Follower Framework, an exception is added concerning extra inventory and outfits, hiding those features to Karliah by default. Outfit dialogue is not hidden if a NFF outfit slot is in use for her.
Works fine with **RDO** and will automatically generate an NPC "exception" in RDO to allow Karliah to function separately. In other words, works outside of it and is not affected by it.
  

  
**MCM Control**

  
* Comprehensive MCM menu under "Nether's Karliah".
See status of Darkness Returns Quest.
  
* See status of Relationship with Karliah, you can set it to whatever rank you want to.
Set the ability to speak extra idles and/or location lines.
  
* Set frequency of idles and/or location lines. Note that these sliders are dynamic and you will need to lower the minimum values beforing lowering the maximum values (and the reverse). Only updates in game after the last idle time has passed.
Can change percentage chance of idle/location lines spoken.
  
* Enable or Disable Humor, Flirty or Lewd lines. All lines are more or less "lore friendly". Flirty is suggestive but "cute", Lewd can cross the line a bit but is not outrightly vulgar. There are not very many Humor lines but they are there - some are bad pun level.
Can toggle on or off special abilities.
  
* Can hide or show Outfit, Storage and Home dialogues. Hiding does not affect the functionality.
Can cause all vanilla dialogues to be "completed", hiding them from view.

**Notice**

  
* I feel this version of Karliah is 100% game-ready but there is a lot more to do in terms of adding more interaction and quest awareness and perhaps new quests in the future to go along with it.
With no intent to scare off any LE players, while there is no mod page specifically for Legendary Edition, the installer for this mod does include an LE version and will attempt to auto-detect your version of Skyrim upon install. I do not play LE on a regular basis and this version is provided in the spirit of community, with no guarantees expressed or implied. That being said, it should work fine but I believe in being transparent regarding this.
  

**Future Goals**

  
* [size=3]The aim of the "Nether's" series of follower mods is to flesh out existing game characters and to make them into what they could have been.
  
It takes time to really produce what I feel are believable lines that Karliah would say and I have to be in the proper headspace to do it. I don't want lines to sound insincere, repetitive or annoying, just to squirt out hundreds of additional lines. Thought it put into every sound byte in this package.
  
- There aren't a huge amount of flirty or lewd lines thus far. Trying to balance towards innuendo rather than being outright perverse. Marriage lines are very slim right now.
I have plans to add interactions with other NPCs and followers as voice models improve for xVASynth. This must be balanced out property and not be game breaking or too complex.
  
- Certainly what is already on the table will be expanded.

**Troubleshooting**
  
**Black/Blue or Face that doesn't look anything like the Promo shots:**An NPC overhaul is deployed in lower load order than Nether's Karliah. Make sure Nether's Karliah is lower so that it "wins".
  
  
**Head is missing or different hair is showing:**You may have installed some kind of "wigs" mod that overhauls the armor to put hair in it and makes default NPCs bald to try to create some kind of wig or barber shop system. Make sure Nether's Karliah is lower in load order than this kind of mod.
  
  
**LE version:**An LE version is included in the installer. The esp was generated by running it through the creation kit and saving out. LE version shouldn't have any issues as quests are not directly manipulated. Basically this is just a header change and I do not play LE except to provide light testing. There is zero chance I would re-create the entire mod in Creation Kit for LE, so this is the best I can offer in the spirit of community.
  
  
**Testing**

  
* Big thanks to CKord for help with testing this and other followers.
Thanks to several "prefer to be nameless" friends on Discord for testing support.
