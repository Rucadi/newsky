Those of you who have followed my modding know that this mod has been a long time coming. It really is the cornerstone of all the storytelling I plan to do with my mods. The creation of this mod was the hardest task I have put myself to so far. I learned a lot, and I will apply those new skills to future mods. This mod will be updated more in time as well. It takes time to work with the voice actresses for Anja and Kelsa, so be patient. I plan to add more banter, more quests, and more romance features in time.
  
  
I'm not the only one that worked hard on this mod. My good friends [JobiWanUK](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/JobiWanUK/mods?gameId=1704) and [Socalista](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Socalista/mods?gameId=1704) did their best work to provide you addons that are just as meaningful as the main mod. You can read more about the addons below. I can't thank them enough for helping me to bring the stories of the Iceheart Sisters and the Woken Furies to life. This is only the beginning folks. Please visit their profiles and grab their amazing mods when you have time.
  
  
Last but not least, I ask that you endorse and vote for mod of the month for this mod. We would really appreciate the support. Thank you!
  
  
**A Note About Replacers For This Mod**
  
I would like to ask modders not to make replacers for the Iceheart Sisters for at least a month from the time of release. I want to give my designs and the mod a chance to soak in exactly how I envisioned them. I hope that makes sense to other modders who want to make replacers. Have a great day!

This mod has three parts. The main mod, which is The Iceheart Sisters followers. The second part is the Iceheart Mill location. And finally, we have the NPC Comments and Banter addon.
  
  
**The Iceheart Sisters**
  
  
**\*\* This Mod is NOT ESL-Flagged \*\***
  
  
This mod has two followers, Anja Iceheart and her sister, Kelsa Iceheart. Both mods are voiced by real actresses. There are around 1,000 lines between the two sisters and more to come. The main features are:
  
  
**Fully-Voiced Followers**
  
Anja Iceheart and Kelsa Iceheart. Anja is voiced by the renowned VA of Ivy of Fallout 4 fame, Kitt Nevada ([KittenVox](https://twitter.com/kittenvox)). Kelsa is voiced by the lovely and talented [Ophelia Valentine](https://www.twitch.tv/opheliavalentine), a Twitch streamer and Youtuber. I spent a good deal of time scouting the exact voices I wanted for each sister. I owe so much to both of the VAs for their hard work and excellent quality on this mod. I'm so glad I found them and they agreed to work with me.
  
  
**Romance System**
  
I designed and scripted this romance system myself. Several of my friends gave me some great information on how they would do it, with some examples. It wasn't easy to do what I wanted, and I don't consider it finished or perfect. That said, here's how it works:
  
  

  
* As soon as you finish the brief introduction quest for each sister, the romance quest starts.
You can romance both sisters, but only marry one of them.
  
* The sister(s) must be following the player for the romance to proceed. If you dismiss them, the romance is paused.
In order to advance stages of the romance, you must spend time with them.
  
* There are 4 stages of the romance. Friend, Confidant, Lover, and Spouse.
Each stage takes 7 in-game days to advance. Again, they must be grouped with you for the timer to move forward. To me, this is the most accurate way for people to fall in love. By spending time together. Not gifts. or spicy dialogue lines.
  
* Once you reach the 4th stage with one or both sisters, you can ask one of them to marry you.
When you marry one of sisters, the other sister's romance quest is stopped and the player's romance stage is returned to stage 2 - confidant. No, the sisters don't want to share their husband or wife, but will remain close friends with their sister's husband or wife.
  
* You will notice more loving dialogue from the sisters as the stages progress.
When you marry a sister, you gain a permanent perk/buff (listed below). Each sister provides a different buff related to their frost-heritage.
  

  
**Summoning Spell Lesser Power**
  
After the introduction quest for each sister, you will immediately be given a spell (not a book) to summon them. This is a lesser power type spell which can be cast at will with nearly no mana cost.
  
  
**Follow Close Move To Behavior**
  
By default each sister is set to stay close to the player. If the player moves more than 3200 units away, the sister will immediately teleport to the player's side. This prevent either sister from getting stuck or lost from the player. Obviously, this feature is turned off when you tell them to wait or dismiss them. You can also completely turn this feature off through a dialogue menu setting if you don't like it.
  
  
**Set Home and Move**
  
You can tell either sister where to live, as long as it is indoors. They will live there and go back there when you tell them to head home. After you set their home, you can tell them to move if you want to change their home to a new location, and the home will reset and allow you to pick a new home.
  
  
**Outfit System**
  
Each sister has three outfits you can tell them to wear. They have a sleep outfit, a home outfit, and an adventure outfit. These outfits can be set through a dialogue menu. Once you tell them to wear the outfit they will put what you have chosen for them on. They will not automatically switch outfits based on the condition like sleep or home, you must switch manually. That said, I may expand upon this feature in the future, but at least now you don't need another mod to manage their outfits.
  
  
**Other Features**
  

  
* Reverie Skin﻿ 1.11+ by Novelyst﻿. Eyes by wammy and docteure from Eyes of Beauty Remastered.
New Visions series uses your installed body. Compatible with 3BA, BHUNP, CBBE, TBD, and UNP bodies.
  
* Visions mod architecture for smaller footprint and better performance. Works with obody and wetfunction.
FOMOD installer lets you choose SMP or NON-SMP installation.
  

  
**Location**
  
**You can find them wandering around Whiterun. At night they share tales and drink with the Companions.**

The Iceheart Sisters are twin (not identical) sisters who were found on the northern shores of Skyrim when they were infants. They were raised in the area around Dawnstar under the care of a rather famous bounty hunter named Varg One-Eye. It was clear from a young age that the sisters were different. The people of Dawnstar loved them greatly, but also feared their latent magical abilities. Scholars visited them and declared that they were only part human, with the other part being... something else. Whatever their heritage, they both had innate abilities with frost magic. Anja displayed skill with frost spells and Kelsa using frost to enhance her strength and martial skills.
  
  
Varg not only became their foster-father, he taught them all he knew about the business of bounty hunting. For years the two sisters went on missions with their foster-father, helping him complete his bounty quests. When they came of an age to work on their own, the sisters bought a mill in Riften Hold and converted it to a tavern and base of operations for their bounty hunting business. A few years ago, Varg went missing on a mission to Solstheim.

Anja is a Frost Witch. She can be a little abrasive at times, but she is actually extremely caring. She is the brains of the duo, and a solid tactician. She loves her sister more than anything else and is often a little overprotective. She doesn't give her heart easily, but when she does so, she gives everything.
  
  
As a Frost Witch, Anja's skills reside in Destruction, Restoration, and Conjuration. She specializes in frost magic, obviously. She has skills in stealth and light armor as well. Anja has a low cost Frost Cloak she uses during combat. She also has some special perks:
  
  
**Frostborn Mage**
  
Frost spells increase weakness to frost by 35% for 30 seconds for typically frost-resistant races.
  
  
**The Frost King's Blessing**
  
Frost damage increases if a filled soul gem is in inventory. 1 Greater Soul Gem = 15% increase, 10 Grand Soul Gems = 50%, 5 Black Soul Gems = 100%.
  
  
**IceBlaze**
  
Anja's unique frost dagger that does extra frost damage on hit. Thanks [Gonzeh84](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Gonzeh84?gameId=1704) for converting this to Skyrim for me.
  
  
When Anja is married, her spouse will receive the **Mantle of the Frost King** perk (see Kelsa below).
  
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/GHPmbbd.png)
  
  
Kelsa is a Frost Barbarian. She is the more naive and outgoing sister, often getting into trouble through sheer innocence. She is very friendly and still mending from a broken heart. She looks up to her sister and will do anything to help her. She is the brawn of the bounty hunting duo.
  
  
As a Frost Barbarian, Kelsa's skills reside in Two-handed Weapons (especially warhammers), Heavy Armor and Blocking. She does have some inherent frost magic, and like Anja she can use a frost cloak during combat. Her special abilities are:
  
  
**Mantle of the Frost King**
  
Weapons and armor blessed with frost enchantments grant increased healing rate and double damage against fatigued or slowed foes. Power attacks deliver stronger enchanted blows.
  
  
**The Frost King's Blessing**
  
Frost damage increases if a filled soul gem is in inventory. 1 Greater Soul Gem = 15% increase, 10 Grand Soul Gems = 50%, 5 Black Soul Gems = 100%.
  
  
**Frostskjelv**
  
Kelsa's unique warhammer that does frost damage on hit. (credit to [Steelfeathers](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/steelfeathers/mods?gameId=1704) for providing this awesome warhammer)
  
  
When Kelsa is married, her spouse will receive the **Frostborn Mage** perk (see Anja above).

**Important Note:** One of the NPCs in this mod that has the possibility to become a follower requries [Relationship Dialogue Overhaul - RDO SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1187). If you choose not to use RDO, it will only mean this particular NPC can't become a follower.
  
  
**The Iceheart Mill is ESL-Flagged to save a spot in your load order.**
  
  
The Iceheart Sisters purchased this mill and renovated it to be their home and base of operations. It can serve as a player home for 8 followers. The mill has many features, and the mod also has quests and a bonus fully voiced follower.
  
  

  
* Bounty Board with 5 unique bounty quests
Fully stocked Tavern Merchant
  
* Tavern merchant starts a special bounty quest line following the completion of the bounty board tasks
Full Crafting Stations and linked activator storage by category
  
* 4 single beds and 2 double beds, 4 cells with bedrolls in the basement
3 Unique Bounty Quest Enemies - What will your choices be?
  
* Patches for Hjertesten Hall, Blackthorn Manor, Lux, Lux Via, Landscape Fixes for Grass Mods, and Bjorn. More patches will be added as needed.
**Bonus Follower "Susannah" with 758 AI voice lines from [Megaman2K's Simply Open Source Voice Pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92904)﻿ (download the addon for her in the miscellaneous section of the Files tab). Requires the linked voice pack by Megaman2K.**
  
* **Added Elysium Estate Teleporter to the Iceheart Mill with an addon. Check miscellaneous section of the file tab. You can find it in the basement of the mill.**

**The NPC Comments and Banter Addon is ESL-Flagged to save a spot in your load order.**
  
  
This Addon provides NPC Comments from various NPCs towards the Iceheart Sisters. The goal of this Addon is to make the Iceheart Sisters feel like a natural part of Skyrim itself. The people of Skyrim know them and will talk to or about them. There is also banter between the two sisters (conversations with each other). Here are the specifics:
  
  

  
* Five scenes between Anja and Kelsa with various triggers
Special scene in the Bannered Mare where Mikael will sing a song for Anja
  
* Features around 90 new lines voiced by the original Iceheart Sisters voice actresses
Random NPCs will approach one or both of them and attempt to flirt with them, with random reactions
  
* Selected NPC voice types will greet one of the sisters, with random greetings in return
Selected vanilla NPCs will make comments about one or both of the sisters when they are close by
  
* Greetings and flirting will work with mod-added NPCs that have vanilla voice types

  
Every 24 hours there's a random chance of a scene with a vanilla NPC of either gender (selected voice types only) approaching one of the sisters and trying to flirt with them. The sister will reply with a random response. Every 8 hours there's a random chance of a brief scene where a unique vanilla NPC will greet one or both of the sisters, with random responses.

**Notes**
  
  

  
* Anja appears with different hairstyles in some screenshots and videos because we were in beta testing and still deciding what hair we would choose. One of the hairstyles had terrible clipping issues so we decided to go with a new one.
**We advise that you not import The Iceheart Sisters followers into any follower management mods. While we believe it works with NFF, if you choose certain features in NFF you will break their follower functionality. No other follower frameworks should even be attempted.**
  

  
**Planned Future Updates**
  
  

  
* The main Iceheart Sisters mod may have feature updates such as additional romance features, more lines, and additional quests. A lot of these types of updates are dependent on the voice actresses availability. Please don't ask for timelines. We will keep you updated.
Patches to the The Iceheart Mill can be requested either in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/JrpPh6F2tu)﻿ or in the comments section. We also encourage other mod authors to make patches of their own and publish them as separate mods.
  
* The NPC Comments and Banter Mod may have additional banter added in the future, again dependent on the availability of the VAs.
There is a planned quest mod called "Fathers Hunt" that will tell the story of The Iceheart Sisters heritage and take the player on a journey with them in search for their father.
  
* More Packages to allow the sisters to sandbox at the Mill and other places.
More patches for the Mill location and compatibility with other location and mods that change the area.
  
* Adding 758 AI voice lines to Susannah
