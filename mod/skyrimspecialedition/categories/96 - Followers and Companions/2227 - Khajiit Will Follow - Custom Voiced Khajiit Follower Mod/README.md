**[font=Georgia]Compatibility and Installation Notes[/font]**
  
Spoiler
  

  
* **AFT/NFF/EFF Compatibility** - KWF followers are NOT compatible with mods that alter follower behavior, including AFT. Their AI is convoluted, and these mods \*will\* break their brains.
**AI Voice Synthesis** - I will not use AI synthesis to produce dialogue, and I will not approve requests from others to produce their own AI-synthesized audio using voicework contained within KWF. Please respect me and all the other voice actors involved in this project and do not use our voices to train an AI algorithm without our consent.
  
* **Khajiit Speak Patches** - Do NOT use any KS patches for KWF. They are all out of date, and using them may break quests and marriage, cause other unpredictable behavior, or result in CTDs. I will not provide support if you are using a Khajiit Speak patch for KWF.
**Marriage Compatibility** - KWF Followers are compatible with all vanilla, Hearthfire, and AE/CC houses. Additional custom houses may be added in the future, but for now, that's it. If you have adopted, you MUST have a KWF-supported house for your KWF spouse and children, or the marriage ceremony may not properly complete.
  
* **Project Ja-Kha'jay** - If you use the Project Ja-Kha'jay KWF replacers, you may need to UNINSTALL them when updating your version of KWF, and then reinstall them afterward. Failure to do so may result in the gray face bug for all replacer'd KWF NPCs.
**Bards College Expansion** - This mod uses custom interior cell for the Bards College, resulting in Nanak and Ma'kara's quests being impossible to complete. Kingath has a compatibility patch on their forums. Alternatively, you can teleport into the "real" Bards College with "coc SolitudeBardsCollege"
  

  
Vigilant Patch Only
  

  
* **SKSE Required - SKSE** (https://skse.silverlock.org/ ) is required for the Vigilant content patch.
**Compatibility** - The KWF x Vigilant patch has a minor conflict with Cities of the North: Dawnstar. COTN moves the XYZ coordinates of the Dawnstar Inn interior cell, resulting in the KWF follower spawning outside the playable area and falling into the void. This can be fixed by using the Khajiit-attuned Horn to summon them after entering, or by traveling to the Temple of Stendarr after accepting Altano's invite.
  
* **Vigilant Voiced** - It is HIGHLY SUGGESTED that you play the KWF x Vigilant patch with the Vigilant Voiced mod by Aelarr (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11894). Can't recommend it enough.
