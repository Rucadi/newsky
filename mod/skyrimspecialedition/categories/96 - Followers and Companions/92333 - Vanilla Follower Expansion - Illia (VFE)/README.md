**Vanilla Follower Expansion - Illia**
  
This mod adds new lines to Illia, the ex-witch from Darklight Tower.
  
  
**PLEASE SEE THE "ARTICLES" TAB FOR CONTENT WARNINGS**
  
  
**Overview**
  
This mod adds ~100 new lines of dialogue to Illia, generated with Elevenlabs AI voice cloning (see "videos" tab for an example). Illia was born in Darklight Tower, and now you can learn all about the frost mage as you journey through Skyrim together! She'll make a few comments on cities, dungeons and other locations. 100% lore-friendly (but not canon)!
  
  
You will be able to access the new lines once you have completed her quest in Darklight Tower, and have recruited her as your follower.
  
  
What this mod does:
  

  
* Add idle dialogue to Illia
Add backstory to Illia
  
* Integrate into the vanilla follower system

  
What this mod does not do:
  

  
* Add romance or marriage
Turn her into a "super-follower" à la Inigo, Lucien, Remiel, etc.
  
* Add any new follower mechanics

  
**Requirements**
  

  
* Skyrim SE/AE (should be compatible with both)
﻿[Configurable Commentary Rate Slider](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38670)﻿ [Not strictly required, but the idle dialogue will get annoying VERY quickly. I recommend you raise the time between comments to 10-20 mins]. [If you don't want to use CCRS, check out Sranger's patch that reduces the time between comments.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93447)﻿ (Version 1.2 also does this, but in a slightly different way)
  

  
**Compatibility**
  
This is a good question, I'm like 90% sure this should be compatible with everything, because it doesn't touch Illia herself. The one thing that will break it is if a mod changes the "Illiaref" reference in DarklightTower01, but I don't know of any mods that do that.
  
**Bugs**
  
If you notice a spelling error, font bug (aka a square in the subtitles) or other bug, please report it in the bugs section. English *is* my first language, I'm just an idiot.
  
**Installation**
  
Drag and drop into your favorite mod manager. Load after anything that touches Illia.
  
  
**Uninstallation**
  
Disable the mod and cross your fingers. I am not liable for any save corruption.
