# (NEW) Thogra gra-Mugur - Orc Follower and Quest
- Author: Dama Karmelowa - ColdSun1187

**DESCRIPTION**
  
  
Thogra gra-Mugur is a woman on a mission. Currently, she is also dying. If you save her life, you will get a loyal (if somewhat gruff) follower and friend. But whether her loyalty will be rewarded, well... that is entirely up to you.
  
  
A new and improved version of my original mod, Thogra now speaks in an all-new voice (my own, lol). For a more detailed list of new and old features, see below.
  
  
Thogra is a collab between myself (story, scripting, voice acting) and [coldsun1187](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/9762372) (who designed and implemented Thogra's looks). We hope you enjoy the mod! Please let us know what you think in the comments.
  
  
  
**FEATURES**
  
  

  
* About 1200 lines of dialogue.
Vanilla quest awareness: Skyrim main quest, Dragonborn DLC main quest, some Daedric quests (currently Malacath and Hermaeus Mora).
  
* Her own quest with two different endings and rewards depending on your choice.
Thogra is essential (except at certain points in the quest).
  
* She banters with some vanilla NPCs (currently [Frea](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Frea)﻿, [Yamarz](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Chief_Yamarz)﻿, and the NPCs living at [Nightgate Inn](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Nightgate_Inn)﻿).
She can banter with other custom-voiced followers. For a detailed list, see below.
  
* Uses whatever body and skin you have installed.
Convenience add-ons: tracker and summon spell (both obtained after you first recruit her).
  
* She lives at Nightgate Inn by default, but you can also assign her a different home. The option appears after you've spent some time with her and she's begun to open up to you, so be patient.
She is compatible with Nether's Follower Framework (and probably other follower management mods other than UFO, but if you're using UFO you should consider switching to a newer framework anyway). That means you can import her into NFF and similar, and she will continue to work fine.
  
* As of ver. 2.5, you can romance and marry Thogra after you've completed the quest Thogra's Revenge. For more information, see below.

**HOW TO START**
  
  
You can find Thogra by the roadside close to the Nightgate Inn, going towards Windhelm.
  
  
After you recruit her, you can ask to learn more about her. Keep talking to her about her past every few days, and eventually the quest will start.
  
  
  
**ROMANCE AND MARRIAGE**
  
  
You can romance and eventually marry Thogra after completing the quest Thogra's Revenge. Just put on an Amulet of Mara and hopefully all will go well!
  
  
As an Orc, Thogra is open to a poly relationship. For the player, that means that you can marry her in addition to having a vanilla marriage (or a relationship with any custom follower who uses the PlayerMarried faction). For Thogra, it means... nothing much, actually, but it's there for roleplay reasons. Of course, the poly relationship is optional, and you can also choose to have an exclusive relationship with Thogra (which will block you from vanilla marriage).
  
  
You can end the relationship before it gets to the proposal stage. Thogra can also break up with you if she thinks you're too incompatible. Tips for a successful romance: be fair, don't insult her, don't try to discourage her from getting revenge. (You may suggest it once, but anything after that will end the romance before it starts.)
  
  
Finally, you'll have two wedding options, but the temple wedding has far less content and is there just in case the Orc wedding doesn't work for you, or if you roleplay a Vigilant of Stendarr, or something. I recommend choosing the Orc wedding for more content. (Note that the temple wedding is not the same as the vanilla wedding. The Orc wedding has more content than vanilla, but the temple wedding has less. It's really just intended as a failsafe, or if you really don't want to do the Cursed Tribe quest.)
  
  
  
**INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER FOLLOWERS**
  
  
Thogra can banter with other custom-voiced followers. Currently that includes the following mods:
  
  

  
* [Karla Raven](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/115187)﻿﻿ by coldsun1187 & myself (patchless)
[Remiel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51874)﻿ by Maplespice (install the patch in Remiel's FOMOD)
  
* [Xelzaz](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62893)﻿ by Blue PwnsU (patchless)
[Yazakh](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68568)﻿ by RobotPolarBear (install the patch under Optional Files)
  
* [Vito the Vampire Hunter](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38928)﻿ by myself (install the patch on Vito's mod page)
[Flint - A Minotaur Follower](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/87294)﻿ by eggsben3d1ct (install the patch under Optional Files)
  

  
  
**KNOWN INCOMPATIBILITIES**Thogra is incompatible with [UFO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10681)﻿, meaning she won't work correctly if installed together with UFO. Recommended solution: do not use UFO, it's a very old framework and has multiple issues. Consider switching to Nether's Follower Framework instead. I cannot fix this issue from my end due to the type of edits that UFO makes. Thanks to LordVoidh for reporting the issue!
  
  
  
**THOGRA REVOICED VS. THE LEGACY SKVA VERSION**
  
  
In the [Legacy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58979) version, Thogra uses the vanilla FemaleOrc voice with additional lines generated by using SKVA. I have now set that version to hidden - hmu if you really want a download link but it's been deprecated for ages and it's objectively worse than this one.
  
  
Legacy Thogra is not compatible with Thogra Revoiced. You cannot upgrade from Legacy to Revoiced in mid-playthrough, and you also cannot install both at the same time. No double Thogra, sorry!
  
  
Patches, translations, and sub-mods created for Legacy are mostly incompatible with Revoiced. The only exception I know about is the Lux patch, that one still works fine. Everything else would probably need to be updated to work with the new version.

**MY POLICY ON AI VOICES**
  
  
Vanilla NPCs are voiced by spliced vanilla lines (like Yamarz), unvoiced (like Frea), or with voice cloning (like some NPCs involved in the wedding). My policy is to ensure that the generated lines are as close as possible to vanilla in spirit, and remain respectful of the talented voice actor who voiced the original NPC. I am not profiting from this mod in any way (including donation points, Patreon, etc.) and I will of course remove any AI lines if requested by the original VA (as I have already done on finding out that Frea's VA had previously objected to cloning her voice).
  
  
I do not permit cloning or splicing my voice for use in pornographic mods under any circumstances. For other mods, I'd prefer to just collab the normal way, but feel free to reach out and discuss.
