[/size]Mod Requirements
  
Skyrim | Just the base game!
  
  
  
Compatibility
  
SDA has a lot of content, but it is lightweight on performance and was designed with compatibility in mind. For more information, [read the compatibility article here.](https://sites.google.com/view/martimiusmods#h.47v9mbf31ws2)
  
  
  
  
Install Instructions
  
Install using your preferred mod manager as usual, ensuring the esp is active before game launch. For first-time SDA installations, a new save is advised. However, updating on an existing save is generally safe.
  
  
PC users with Nemesis or FNIS animation frameworks should run these post-installation to enable animations like Serana removing her hood.
  
  
For the optional patches, get [them here on the Patch Hub](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70782).
  
  
  
[size=4]Update Instructions
  
Just replace the old version with the new one. No clean-save is required (however, if you are upgrading to 4.0 from 3.3 and older, you do need a clean save/new game). 
  
  
  
Uninstalling
  
Uninstalling mods like SDA is unsafe mid-save, since it adds scripts that are baked into your save and makes alterations to existing game records and NPCs (Serana most notably). Make sure you test this mod out first before you keep in your load order for real.
  
  
  
Load Order
  
SDA was designed with compatibility in mind, but there are conflicts with various mods here and there. Load SDA nearer to the bottom of the load order and you generally should be fine. To be extra sure that SDA wins all conflicts, open up the plug-in in xEdit, right click, and select “Apply Filter for Conflicts”. If there are any, make sure you're using an SDA patch (if one is available), make a personal plugin-in patch (if you have the know-how), ask me to make one, or just move SDA lower in the load order to win that conflict.
  
  
**For more information and burning questions, [please visit my website!](https://sites.google.com/view/martimiusmods)**
  
**Final Author’s Note:**
  
SDA is written, designed, and performed by humans. Earlier builds included limited **AI-generated voice** for a few **non-Serana** NPCs; that legacy audio remains temporarily and will be **removed or re-voiced**. No AI-generated **art** or **in-game text** ships in the mod going forward.

**Disclaimer of Endorsement:**
  
The views, beliefs, and opinions expressed within this Mod, whether directly or indirectly, are solely those of the fictional characters and do not necessarily reflect the views or beliefs of the Mod Author. This Mod is a work of fiction and should be treated as such.
  
  
**Restrictions on Use:**
  
1. **Prohibition on AI Training/Voice Use:**  Use of the voice recordings included in this Mod for artificial intelligence training or generation is strictly prohibited. This restriction is in place to respect the voice actors' rights and protect their performances. 
  
2. **No Redistribution or Uploading:** You may not upload or redistribute any files from this Mod to any third-party websites, file-sharing platforms, or other online services, even for personal use.

4. **Mod Packs:** Mod pack authors are welcome to include this Mod in their compilations, provided that they do not profit from its inclusion and clearly credit the Mod Author. 
  
  
**AI Clarification (Transparency -- SDA):**
  
• **Legacy scope:** Prior updates used limited **AI-generated voice** for certain **non-Serana** characters during a period when my stance was looser.
  
• **Current policy:** No new AI voices will be added. Legacy AI voice lines will be **(1) removed**, **(2) replaced with spliced dialogue from existing human-performed lines**, or **(3) re-voiced by impressionist voice actors** as schedule allows.
  
• **Rights-holder requests:** If Bethesda, original VAs, or their representatives/talent agencies want any affected content **removed immediately**, contact me via the mod page channels and I will comply promptly.
  
• **Writing & design:** Story and dialogue are **human-authored and edited**. I may use AI tools (e.g., LLMs) **outside the game build** for process support (style/grammar checks, outlining options, patch-note/announcement drafting, documentation clarity, workflow efficiency).
  
• **Art & assets:** No AI-generated art is included.
  
• **AI training on this mod’s assets:** Prohibited. *(If unsure, see Restriction #1 for voice recordings and apply the same rule to all assets.)*
