**Find her alone in the Sleeping Giant Inn after being attacked by witch hunters.
  
She studied at the Arcane University, ran away from her castle, casts spellcurses on Nazeem, and sets you on fire if you try to abandon her (you monster).**

This is my legacy version of Daegon Kaekiri. I spent a year updating her, changing her with each update, trying to create something I could be proud of. She had a crazy, fantastic Game of Thrones type backstory, something that usually felt out of place inside The Elder Scrolls lore, but also kind of badass and fun at the same time. I rewrote quests for her for six months, never settled on anything that felt good enough for her, burned myself out, and then decided to change her age from 19 to 800 and give her a companion for endless banter.
  
I realize now that while it turned out a pretty cool mod, I had also changed her so much that the only thing that remained untouched was her name. So here is my first ever release.
  
  
  
**So what is the difference????**
  
[font=Verdana]Daegon Legacy (this mod)[/font]
  
[left]﻿SpoilerDaegon Legacy is just Daegon. She's young, her story is just starting. She was betrayed by everyone she's ever loved, and has ran away into your arms. She doesn't trust anyone but you. She has a bit of fresh trauma and is frightened of spiders. She's sarcastic, a little wicked, has a bit of an attitude and was built to encourage you to pursue the more murderous quests of Skyrim. She's built into the TES Lore as much as possible, with some room for an interesting backstory. She hates the dark and equips lanterns at night and casts firefly magic in spooky dungeons. She has a pet rat that doesn't get in your way, but is cute with how he scurries on the floor sometimes, and other times sits and naps on her shoulder. She casts curses on a few NPCs but other than that, she really only talks to you.

[font=Verdana]Daegon & Kaeserius [(the other mod)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78745/?tab=description)[/font]
  
[left]Spoiler[Daegon and Kaeserius](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78745/?tab=description)﻿ is for lovers of high fantasy, with a dungeons and dragons-type storyline.
  
Since there are no Altmer Princesses in TES Lore, I created new lore for her so I could write as much magical backstory for her as I wanted.
  
(Imagine Baldurs Gate 3 vibes) (I understand that's a very risky decision and is a dealbreaker for most.)
  
She is older and wiser here. She has been on many adventures with Kaeserius & has endless tales to share with you.
  
Her spider fears have developed into a terrifying phobia where she falls to the floor and has a breakdown if she sees one.
  
She's still a runaway Princess but she never went to the Arcane University. 
  
  
Like most players, I love when followers have banter. But I didn't just want a few conversations to loop through, *I wanted thousands.*
  
AND I LOVE witty, joking conversations--
  
so I plotted for a bit on how to get the most entertaining banter out of murderous Daegon, and my solution was to make Kaeserius.
  
A lot of it is funny, some is more immersion for roleplaying, and some uncovers their backstory and tales. The goal was to keep things fun and interesting. To make Skyrim feel more high fantasy and magical because I eat that stuff up. 
  
I was so excited to create what I thought was the coolest shit ever that I made Daegon much more pleasant to be around.
  
She's happy in this version and super nice to the player. She fully takes over the role of being your bestest friend.
  
  
She doesn't just heal you, she can also prevent your death. She has the goodies+ of original Daegon but with me racking my brain thinking what else can i possibly make her do besides teleport herself out of your screen??? She still lights her magic lantern in the dark, but now she also braids her hair inside dungeons. She trots over and picks up skill books and reads them to you! A trail of magical glitter sparkles where she walks. Kaeserius has the most advanced and visually fun combat I've ever seen. Raiding tombs with him is like going on a roller coaster during fright fest. They worry about each other, and you, and chatter all the time. You can hug them, they can hug each other, it's fun.
  
They're fun. But a duo isn't for everyone, so the option is here.

**Why did you add Kaeserius in the other mod version?**
  
Spoiler I kind of touched on this for a bit but I love banter. Conversations between NPCS makes them feel real, and the goal has always been to make my followers feel like they're genuinely there with you. Collaborating with other Mod Authors for banter is fun, but schedules don't always line up, and it takes a long time. My short term and long term solution was to add my own humorous male follower to kind of keep sassy Daegon in check. To joke with her, check on her, reference her; basically to make you feel like you're inside this super cool team of powerful characters that are constantly interacting with everything. They crack jokes in combat, have conversations during quests, and check on you constantly. It's different, definitely overwhelming for some, but for me, it felt cozy when I played with them. Instead of one character making a short remark during Quests, they have conversations about what's going on during each stage. Easier to create funny situations and jokes instead of just one liners.  
  
**Sure, but why are they a forced pair (in the other mod version?!)??**
  
Spoiler I wanted to create something never done before. A super advanced pair that reacts to everything. You dismiss Daegon, Kaeserius says he's going with her. You get hurt in combat, Kaeserius tells Daegon that she needs to be paying more attention to you and needs to heal you. Daegon gets downed in combat, Kaeserius is like *wtf dae???* and picks her up. It's fun, but it's something I probably should not have done to an existing solo character, and it's something I won't do to you again. 
  
  
**The voice acting in this version isn't as good.**
  
Spoiler Right after I made the very first Daegon I had surgery on my mouth and it went wrong. I couldn't open my mouth or speak very well for several months, and it got progressively worse until I became hospitalized. I recorded most of her lines during this time because she was my only outlet at the time and working on her made me happy. Most of my recordings were unusable, and the ones that weren't I spent a lot of time editing out the pain in my voice, but I can still hear it. It was the reason I worked on her constantly but could never play or test her in my own game anymore. I ended up temporarily taking down Daegon's mod page as the update was taking longer than expected. The idea of people downloading and hearing those miserable lines sent me into a panic. It drove me crazy, it drove you crazy, and when I created [Daegon & Kaeserius](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78745/?tab=description), I told myself if I didn't fix all of her lines then I couldn't keep adding more. I started renting out a studio to record in to help with the sound quality, and I rerecorded almost every single line she had. 
  
  
**Why has Daegon always been flagged as Adult Content?**
  
Spoiler Daegon swears! And that's all the adult content she has ever had. This is not for everyone, but this **is** for those who swear.

[font=Verdana]at the end of the day, Daegon was made in less than a year. she was an insane project that completely took over my life. i loved working on her so much that it became all i did. i developed insomnia and watched every sunrise while trying to make her *better.* i thought about her constantly, i talked about her constantly. Daegon brought me many incredible friends and i ultimately pushed many incredible friends away because all i could think and talk about was her. i wanted to make her better, funnier, more advanced, more interesting. i wanted her to have insane questlines that went above and beyond but they never felt good enough. i wanted to give back to everyone that loved fantasy, magic, and adventure, and make something truly fun to play. and at that point, i was already in my own world, so i thought she should be too.
