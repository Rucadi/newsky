**Jesper the guard is a custom voiced follower who will follow you throughout your adventurs, and maybe sing you a few tunes.
  
To find him, simply go to the Bannerd Mare upon sarting the game where he'll be waiting for you.
  
  
You can also find a spell tome to summon him to your location should he not be there upon your arrival... He likes to wander off, bless him.

**Hey all, I haven't had the time to work on the Jesper mod, so for now I've released all the source scripts on the Nexus page. Feel free to create any patches, variations, etc and upload to Nexus/elsewhere. My only stipulation is that gen AI is not used. If you want more voice lines, I would much rather record them for you.

**Future Plans:**
  
  
- Many more unique lines
  
- More dialogue pertaining to quests, locations, and moments. 
  
- More Songs
  
- Follower Quests
  
  
**Requirements:**
  
  
No direct requirements. Its recommended that you install on a new playthrough. Installing mid playthrough *could* cause potential issues. 
  
  
**Compatibility:**
  
  
Jesper isn't directly incompatible with other mods, but I can't promise issues won't come up. As he is on the same framework as [Lucien](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20035), you may encounter similar issues when trying to manage him with follower management mods or house assigning mods. In short, trying to control Jesper with external mods, it might break him. Oopsie. If anyone finds an issue and wants to create a patch, feel free. 
  
  
Known issues with other mods:
  
  
- [Elven Ears for Breton NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/87737 ) (will remove Jesper's helmet)
  
  
**Installation:**
  
  
Install with mod manger or unzip into Data folder. 
  
  
**Updating:**Should be find tupdate mid playjust make sure you don't load in without the mod during.
  
  
**FAQ**Q: Why release in beta?
  
A: Life is busy at the moment. Lots of people have been waiting on this and it was either release it in beta now, or wat until next year. Wanted to get a version available sooner!
  
  
Q: Will you add lines for Anniversary Edtion content?
  
A: Yes, I will at some point. 
  
  
Q: Is he compatible with SE or only AE?
  
A: It *should* be fine, but it's not been tested. It's part of why I will include CC content in a seprate patch down the road. 
  
  
Q: Will he refuse to do crime with you?
  
A: I considered it, but no. He will occasionally make a comment like "I'm not so sure we're supposed to be in here", but for the rule of fun, I didn't want to make a follower that disqualified playstyles. 
  
  
Q: Is he marryable? 
  
A: Yes, but not in a tradtional way... The ceremony is a unique version where you and Jesper recite your vows to one another. At the end of the ceremony, you both recieve rings and a new requestable song unlocks. 
  
  
Q: Do I still get marriage perks like home cooked meals and gold? 
  
A: Yes. Currently you can request a home cooked meal once a day as well as profits from your adventures. Jesper will also occasionally make comments when at home if you have adopted any of the urchin children (Sofia, Alesan, Lucia, Blaise). 
  
  
Q: What about Lover's Comfort effect?
  
A: Currently that isn't available, but you will recieve a Lover's Honningbrew Mead with the home cooked meal that boosts health, stamina and magika. Not a direct replacement, but it will do for now. 
  
  
Q: Why doesn't he have an accent like the other guards? 
  
A: He's a follower from my TIkTok series and the charcter doesn't have an accent like other guards as he's meant to stick out and not fit in with the rest. Also, I suck at Nord accents :D
  
  
Q: Can I give him new gear? 
  
A: Yes, if you give him better gear, he should change into it. From my experience though, he will mostly keep he helmet equipped. And if he changes his helmet and has the face discolouration bug, I'm not sure what to do there because I've exported the face gen, etc, etc. Just a problem I've run into. 
  
  
Q: Why does he start with a wooden sword?
  
A: Little joke for viewers of the series. 
  
  
Q: Can fan art or fan fic?
  
A: Go for it!
  
  
Q: Why is it broken?
  
A: I don't know this is my first follower mod and I'm sorry if I messed it up somehow.
  
  
Q: Why dosn't he play the lute?
  
A: I suck at creation kit. 
  
  
Q: Why doesn't he do x thing? 
  
A: I suck at creation kit. 
  
  
Q: Where is the Thief from your series?
  
A: I will hopefully make him a follower after Jesper is in a more dialogue complete state. 
  
  
Q: Since when is his name Jesper?
  
A: Since now :D
