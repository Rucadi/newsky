About Menace the Wildgirl 
  
  
![](https://iili.io/3cj7nyb.gif)﻿﻿
  
  
She uses the female sultry voice. She carries an axe with a skull attached from my other follower mod [right here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81062) . She uses demoniac skin. She will also come with the bandages on the 2nd image(the left pic) created by [domain wolf](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58790)﻿
  
She is  ESPFE and she is Marriageable and levels up with you.
  
  
Recommended to use [Nether follower framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55653) . You can also use it as a way to remove her bandages/armor from her body by asking her to wear a standard outfit and then back out of the menu and she will be naked.﻿
  
  
  
She uses the nord race
  
  
Also keep in mind the images makes her look taller than she actually is. If you want to see how tall she is check image 9**
  
**Location**
  
  
**She is located in the blind cliff bastion. You get there by going to the blind cliff cave . When you open the iron doors to where the hagraven is she will be next to the iron doors(the doors you just opened)
  
﻿If for whatever reason she  is not there( or you are just lazy) type in the console command 
  
1.help (the follower name) (then press enter)
  
2. then type player.placeatme (her reference id) you will find what her reference id is after you did the first step above.
  
  
Or you can use the mod [size=4][size=4] [Where are you](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76063) that has more functions than using the console command.[/size]
  
[/size]**
  
**Where is her hair mod from?****[Right here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/145303)﻿ Koralina made it for me so be sure to check out [her mod page](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/CoralineKoralina?gameId=1704) 
  
  
Anyway i think that's it!
  
  
If I somehow converted you into a shortstack goblin enjoyer such as myself or you already were one consider downloading my other goblins. I never knew they would be this popular

Note for other mod authors﻿ 
  
  
If you want to give her a voice unique  you have permission to do so. Just let me know when you release her so I can download her!
  
  
Anyway
  
  
I'm not sure what other followers I have in mind. I guess I'll just have to wait until I see a preset here on the nexus that can spark an idea for me. But anyway......Until next time!
