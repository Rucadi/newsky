This lovely chap is my character's childhood best friend, so I wanted to give him some love. Simple replacer. Esl Flagged. 
  
  
Strongly recommend installing [Masculine Argonian Textures (Chameleon and Lizard)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/185)by MONSTERaider. He'll work just fine without it, but he won't have the multicolor effect you see in the screenshots.
  
  
**Full credit** and thanksto [BeastHHBB - Khajiit and Argonian content - player character and NPC replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38480) by Mharlek1 for his feathered hair. <3
