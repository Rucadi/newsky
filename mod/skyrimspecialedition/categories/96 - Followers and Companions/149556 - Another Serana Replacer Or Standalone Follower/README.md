![](https://i.imgur.com/22W81aZ.png)﻿**I really enjoy some Serana replacers out there, I realized [TheFaceSculptor](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/TheFaceSculptor) ﻿had already made one but I had the inspiration to write a mean goth girl so there is a follower version as well.

Follower Version

[b]Squirtcake** was a shock destruction prodigy at the College of Winterhold, turned into a vampire shortly before the Great Collapse. She was taken south by the Bloodlet Throne coven, not as a prisoner, but as a weapon. Bound to them by blood magic, she spent decades gleefully burning villages, torturing intruders, and experimenting on mortals. Her servitude ended only days ago when her coven master finally died. Now she’s lurking near Falkreath, bored, bitter, and looking for something to kill. You find her at the Jarl’s longhouse, waiting for someone interesting to drag her out of this backwater hoping to head north to see what became of her home.
  

Follower version is in Jarl's longhouse in Falkreath
  
She will level with you
  
High destruction skill
  
Shock mastery
  
One handed Mace Adept
  
Light armor adept
  
  
She will of course be extremely lore friendly just like my other extremely undoubtedly lore friendly followers [Cubbi](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/143163) ﻿and [Lily](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/147257)﻿.
  
  
  
  
Voicepack is being tested by [Discord](https://discord.gg/B54P7hApVk)﻿ members currently. The replacer was too good not to be released right away so here you go.
  
  
My eternal gratitude to [Shadowman2777](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/shadowman2777?gameId=1704)﻿, without whom I would still be fumbling in the dark like a maiden lost in a crypt, clutching only hubris and broken mods. His wisdom is the lantern; I am but the moth.
  
  
Thank you to my amazing [donators](https://www.patreon.com/c/DaedricTamer)﻿ who made this mod possible.
