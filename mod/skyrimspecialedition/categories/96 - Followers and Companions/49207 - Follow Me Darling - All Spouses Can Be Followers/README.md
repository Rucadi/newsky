# Follow Me Darling - All Spouses Can Be Followers
- Author: lilebonymace
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49207


This mod allows you to take any spouse on your travels as a follower. It's made by adding them to the potential follower faction, [size=2]so you can ask them to follow you and all the default follower functionality will be enabled for them.
  
Note that it doesn't change the spouse's combat behavior so your spouse may just run away in combat (a follower framework can probably help you with that).

[size=2]Not all of the spouses have follower-compatible voice sets, [RDO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1187) or [Missing Follower Dialogue Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56115) can fix that.
