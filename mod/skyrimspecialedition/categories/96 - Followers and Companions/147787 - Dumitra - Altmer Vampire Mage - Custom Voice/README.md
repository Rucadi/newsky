Dumitra Larethellan may be found at the Dawnstar Docks, where she is in need of a small bit of assistance.
  
  
Dumitra Larethellan** is an Altmer vampire mage originally from the Summerset Isles who studied at the Cloudrest Academy. When the Thalmor claimed dominion over Alinor following the Oblivion Crisis, Dumitra fled the Summerset Isles. She has been in Wayrest, a wealthy kingdom-city in High Rock, for the past 200 years. Dumitra was turned into a vampire by an Elder of the local vampire Clan Montalion of Wayrest shortly after arriving there. She kept a stable position in court for quite some time, just beneath the court mage, and trained students in the arcane arts. Her comfortable position at court was upended when one of her students proved to be a Thalmor spy and betrayed her to the authorities, usurping her position and forcing her to flee.
  
  
**Dumitra** has just arrived in Skyrim at the **Dawnstar Docks**, though fortunately with neither a price on her head nor bounty hunters in pursuit. Having sat around comfortably in court for so many years, she is now interested in traveling for a bit and seeing the other provinces before settling down to start a new life somewhere. She is quite adept at cloaking her vampirism through her knowledge of Alteration and Illusion magic, and is skilled enough to speak freely about it to the player (whose strong will enables them to see through her influence), while being secure in the knowledge that others will not notice her.
  
  
[size=4]**Dumitra** is a master of Alteration, Illusion, and Enchantment, with moderate skills in Destruction magic. She is scholarly and careful, and prefers to fight with a Destruction Staff in her right hand (using her skill at enchantment) and utility spells in her left. Dumitra starts wearing a simple warlock robe, but is not skilled in Light or Heavy Armor, and will prefer to wear clothing, the fancier and more expensive the better.[/size]
  
  
**Dumitra** **is** **[custom voiced](https://sndup.net/4x2gy/)** using 11labs, no VAs were harmed in the making of this mod.

**Options:**
  
  
- **Dumitra's SMP Wig addon that gives her long hair with bangs** **requires** both the **Caenarvon BDOR Hair Pack Addon AND the Dint BDOR Hair Pack**. ***You will need to do a google search for their patreons***, though both of these mods are free and available. **They are a** **REQUIREMENT** **for this addon**. See stickied discussion post for what the hair looks like.
  
  
- Dumitra is compatible with all Outfit Manager mods ([Nether's Follower Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55653), [Dress Up Lovers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28736), [Skyrim Outfit Equipment System NG](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/147011), and so on), but should you not use one and prefer her without a hood in her default outfit (simple warlock robes), simply install the "**No Hood**" option.
  
  
- Dumitra's carefully **Manicured Nails** are provided for ONLY the 3BA and BHUNP body types - they will not work properly with older CBBE or UNP bodies, nor will they work properly with Hands Redone, which is why they are provided as an option rather than default for mer. Nails from [ShasSaaILDred's wonderful mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120716) were used with permission though it is not required.
  
  
- Dumitra lastly has an option for **Younger Hands** should you choose it, this simply smooths out some of the wrinkles and veins on her hands.
  
  
- **Outfits used in the screenshots are:** **[[b]Elanor Timeless Elegance](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/147497)** by DarkDukla and Vergi, and [**Knight Winds**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89980)[/b] **by Elle**.
  
  
- Dumitra uses a range of spells, emphasizing Alteration and Illusion magic, and will use her Chain Lightning staff in combat. Feel free to give her additional staves, though if she runs out of charge, she'll have Destruction magic to replace it. If you use [Nether's Follower Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55653), there is a feature that allows her to use her Enchantment skill to recharge her staff, which is how Socalista suggests powering her spells.
  
  
- If you have two "**Follow me. I need your help.**" dialogue lines to recruit her, congratulations, your game is working as expected. The second line was cloned and added to her dialogue as a failsafe recruit option for some testers with a mod conflict - where we could never figure out which of the 1000s of their mods were in conflict. The lines are identical, with identical recruit scripts attached.
  
  
-Due to the custom voice, Dumitra is not marriageable, nor does she have support as a mother for Hearthfire adoptions. Vampires aren't generally great mothers anyway.

* **Any CBBE/3BA or UNP/BHUNP texture compatible body will work**. Though she has custom textures, **Dumitra** will continue to use whatever body you have set up in your game - she's all ready for OBody assignment or regular play without needing to build a single thing in Bodyslide.
    
    
  [list]
[size=4]If you want to **change her normal maps** (for example, to give her stronger / more noticeable elf brow ridges) she was made with [BnP 2.0](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65274) normals, so any normal from the BnP 2.0 packs will work - face/hands/body.
  

  

  
* If the NPCs in your game are bald, that likely means you are using Racial Skin Variance (RSV) or the Nolvus mod list, both of which are notorious for this issue. Consult instructions in that mod / mod list for how to resolve the issue by excluding NPCs.

[size=4]**Dumitra** is **ESL Flagged** so she is a Light Plugin and will not take a spot in your load order. She was created with the .1170 version of the Creation Kit thus has a 1.71 header (and will not open in older versions of the Creation Kit). Though she does not use the extended FormID range, if you are using an older version of Skyrim and are having difficulty getting this mod to work, try using [Backported Extended ESL Support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441) before posting a bug report.
