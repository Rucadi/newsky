**Geez yall were starving for goblin booty 97k downloads and 827 endorsements! I'm glad everyone enjoys my goblins! I do have an idea for one more however I need a particular hair mod to be made to give her a "wild girl" look. I just have to find someone who is good at making hair. If you know how to make hair in skyrim, feel free to dm me so I can give you the details(on how the goblin hair will look) and preset of another goblin I have
  
Welp I found someone to finally make her hair..this is how she looks! She will be released soon once all of the bugs she is going through is fixed..(edit 3/15/2025)

Please Read**
  
**If you are familiar with what i do and you see some of the images above. I know that not everyone likes what i like...sooo..Vibian  will be regular females in your game. Selkie won't have anything down there unless you give him a schlong.You can however give him a vagina patch If you want Selkie( the femboy goblin) to be a girl make sure you give him the vagina patch in the files section. Vibian comes with a vagina right out of the box when you download. What im about to explain next is for people who are into giving the followers schlongs... so for the normies skip the next paragraph
  
  
 ~~If you want them to have a schlong and for it to match there schlong texture. Go to~~** [~~dw vaginaless mod~~](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65546?tab=files)**[b][size=4]Sense i have my own patches on another site you can disregard  the things i crossed out. I have an easier alternate method for this so that you have the [schlongs appear in your mcm menu](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/31390-futanemesislol-followers-schlong-texture-patches-and-schlong-addons/) . Link is offsite, its alot to read but my other mod should be easy to follow. Everything else that i said below such as the picture of the schlong texture you see below is outdated stuff.﻿**~~and download the schlong texture that looks like the pic below. Obiviously you will need SOS( schlongs of skyrim) for it to to work. After i recommend downloading trx futanari addon this is required as the stuff i explained earlier was textures for this schlong. Just search for it on google. 
  
After that the options you want to choose for the fomod below is. Any normal map option that says athletic/ The default diffuse map/ Specular maps non gloss. With these options you shouldn't have a mismatch between the schlong and body.~~
  
I also forgot to mention..when you give them schlong it may say "This actor was not designed to work with this schlong or its a custom race". What i want you to do is...ignore that warning proceed to giving the goblins the schlong and enjoy the fun bits!

**﻿****![](https://b.l3n.co/i/sTVJKP.png)**
  
﻿An easier and alternate route of adding schlongs to them is by using this mod right [here](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/31390-futanemesislol-followers-schlong-texture-patches-and-schlong-addons/)﻿..it will take you to a nsfw site 
  
**Anyway hiii!! Sorry it took so long to finally release the goblins. This mod wouldn't be possible without the user luckys7ven. Just want to thank them for converting my presets into followers.**

**About the followers**Vibian ( female goblin) is just a regular warrior. Selkie( femboy goblin) is a thief( comes with a dagger). Vibian uses female sultry voice and Selkie uses the young and eager voice. They both use the skin demoniac( not from nexus, its actually from a different site, right click to [translate page](https://regenbot.tistory.com/152?category=682827) .)
  
They are both espfe and they don't take a space in your load order﻿ and they both can be married. They also are both naked when you find them
  
I recommend to use [Nether follower framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55653) . 
  
  
Also small note..if you want to change vibian in the creation kit in any way. Use vex to search her name in there. I changed her name at the last minute because Vibian sounded better. So her esp will say vex....
  
The last small note is to make sure the optional files loads after the main files..if you choose to download those
  
  
**If you want to give Selkie tits or change any of there body shape**
  
  
You need to build your CBBE base body(the preset you want them to have) .
  
After that you go to your folder(skyrim directory)
  
meshes/actors/character/character assets.Copy your
  
femalebody\_0.nif
  
femalebody\_1.nif
  
femalefeet\_0.nif
  
femalefeet\_1.nif
  
femalehands\_0.nif
  
femalehands\_1.nif
  
Then Paste and overwrite it to there Meshes\Actors\character/**The goblin you want to change**\(paste files there)..... this is inside the folder that's my mod
  
  
**﻿Anyway this is what Selkie looks like with tits**
  
![](https://b.l3n.co/i/sT9csb.png)
  
  
Another note for selkie should you choose to keep his chest and not give him breast...Now... you may notice that his chest may move an absurd amount sense he uses a female body. To fix this i recommend you to go in the mcm menu. Find "CBBE 3BA" and then change the "npc settings" to the "A cup". You also want to look at the "toggle npc physics hotkey", this allows you to switch between smp and cbpc for npcs.

﻿
  
If you want to change there height a bit go in the console command. Click on one of the followers and type in setscale 1.07 . They will increase in size a bit.. i recommend to not make them the same size as your character. I increased there head sized because it looked to small on there body. So if you increase there height to match yours..it will look weird.
  
  
**Location****Dead man's inn drink in Falkreath**
  
 ﻿If for whatever reason they are not there( or you are just lazy) type in the console command 
  
1.help Vibian(or in another example help selkie) (then press enter)
  
2. then type player.placeatme (their reference id) you will find what their reference id is after you did the first step above.
  
An alternate route for this is using the [cheat mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70159)﻿ to summon her to you. Or the mod [Where are you](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76063) .
  
**Scaling issues when the goblins interacts with the environment**
  
**If the goblins were to lean against a wall or perform a task and they grow to human size. You can try this [mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4259)﻿ so that they stay their small goblin size**
  
  
﻿
  
  
**Info for the no vagina patches**
  
If you prefer that she doesn't have a vagina and just have a pp, Download the patch(that's in my mod). She won't have a vagina as long as there isn't any clothing on the "body" armor slot(like a bra or chestplate).  If you want the schlong texture to match with her skin. I recommend downloading the schlong texture patch from [dw vaginaless mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65546) . This is the same thing that i was refering to above. Remember she uses demoniac skin. So download the demoniac Schlong texture patch. Also remember you are just downloading the schlong texture patch. And nothing else. She will still have a vagina if you just download the schlong texture patch from dw vaginaless mod(for full package futa peeps out there) and if you don't download my no vagina patch that is in my mod
