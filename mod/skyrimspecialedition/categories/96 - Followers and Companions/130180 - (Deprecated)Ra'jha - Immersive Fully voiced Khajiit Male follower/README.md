Update on Rajha development: 
  
  
Hello all. I hope your holidays were well, some unfortunate news concerning this mods development. I don't have the dedicated time to continue development anymore. And haven't for the past several months. 
  
  
Further more, if and when I do get more time I'll be restarting development as this was my first mod and it's just a mess of spaghetti code.
  
  
Have a happy new years, best of luck, love you all!!**IMPORTANT
  
COMPATIBILITY WARNING!**While 'Ra'jha: The Wayward Khajiit' is generally compatible with most Skyrim mods, it is crucial to note that any follower manager mods like AFT, EFF, UFO, or others that modify follower AI will conflict with Ra'jha's unique behaviors and may cause significant issues. This warning applies similarly to other modded followers. Please exercise caution when using such mods and report any problems you encounter. Your feedback is invaluable for ongoing improvements.

**Disclaimer: Beta Version**
  
*Please note that 'Ra'jha: The Wayward Khajiit' is in beta. While I am committed to improving and updating the mod, updates may not be frequent due to real-life responsibilities.

**Description & [b][color=navy]Features:**[/color][/b]
  
*Ra'jha, a Cathay-raht Khajiit, emerges as a unique follower with his own story, quests, and dynamic resting system. Tall, strong, and bearing the scars of his physical and emotional past, Ra'jha’s presence in Skyrim is as compelling as it is mysterious.*
  
  
***Custom AI:***
  
*Ra'jha has a unique AI that manages his actions and interactions, making him feel alive.****Dynamic Dismiss System:***
  
*The player can choose Ra'jha’s dismissal location**and send him where you want. Whiterun, Solitude, Windhelm, Markath, Riften, or right where you stand!****Voice Acted:***
  
*Fully voice-acted. The voice is crafted to match his rugged, tough persona, with a tone that fits his strong, battle-scarred character. With currently 1000+ lines, more are in the works!****Questline:***
  
*Engage in a personal quest that delves into Ra'jha's past and his family’s history, including the mystery of his sister K'hari.****Combat Style:***
  
**One-handed combat and stealth, as a ruthless assassin**, reflecting his sardonic and rough approach to life’s challenges. (Magic support may come in a later update.)
  
  
**Level Scaling:**
  
Ra'jha levels evenly with the player, maintaining balance and challenge throughout your journey. His stats and skills will scale as you do, ensuring he remains a capable and reliable companion at any level.
  
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
*This mod should not conflict with most other mods. However, any mod that alters follower AI **WILL** conflict with Ra'jha’s unique behaviors. I haven't tested him out with other mods too much. Please let me know if you find any issues.*
