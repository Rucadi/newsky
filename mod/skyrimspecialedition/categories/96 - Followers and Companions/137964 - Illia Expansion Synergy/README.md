Requires [Vanilla Follower Expansion - Illia](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92333)﻿ and [Follower Dialogue Expansion - Illia](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/137845)﻿﻿﻿!

This is a small patch to make these two amazing dialogue expansions just a bit more cohesive, much like my [Brelyna Expansion Synergy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/113523)﻿.
  
  
Vanilla Follower Expansion (VFE) stores its personal questions under a new sub-topic - "I'd like to ask you some questions."﻿
  
  
Follower Dialogue Expansion (FDE), on the other hand, stores its personal questions under its own sub-topic - "Tell me more about yourself, Illia."
  
  
This patch will move VFE's questions into FDE's "Tell me more about yourself, Illia.", while also making placement adjustments and mixing both VFE's and FDE's dialogues together in a way that should provide a naturally flowing conversation through both mods' dialogues should you choose to go through it all at once.
  
  
Because both VFE and FDE each have their own distinct interpretations of Illia's past, I had to choose one to favor while removing some dialogue from the other. I chose to favor FDE's backstory for Illia given that FDE has significantly more dialogue and is more likely than VFE to receive more dialogue in the future.
  
  
Other miscellaneous tweaks have also been made to VFE's dialogues to better match FDE's conventions.

Flagged as ESL.
  
  
I'll keep this updated as necessary with any updates that may come to either mod.
