**Nyri is a confident, jaded succubus MILF who's lived for centuries but speaks with modern millennial cadence. She's protective, flirtatious, and surprisingly domestic when she wants to be. Beneath her sarcastic exterior lies genuine affection for those she cares about.
  
  
She is aware of the players gender so this mod is made for both male and female players.
  
  
She is a dual wielding rogue light armor type role. 
  
  
She can be found at the tavern in Riverwood looking for Cubbi and Lily.
  
  
Just like my other mods this is mainly just idle banter. This is a succubus, be wary of your first meeting with her.**

[size=4][b]FAQ****Save and reload if she won’t talk when meeting her
  
  
If her face is all fudged up remove the nyr asset pack from your load
  
order, re download and reinstall. Sometimes wigs that edit vanilla
  
records may do this as well.
  
  
If she is bald check to make sure you have no wigs overriding vanilla wigs.
  
  
If she has a messed up face same thing as above.
  
  
RSV can also cause issues without a patch which I won't be making but feel free to post your own if you'd like.
  
  
You may want to rebuild the Nyr Bodyslide to 0 in Bodyslide if you use Obody like me.**
