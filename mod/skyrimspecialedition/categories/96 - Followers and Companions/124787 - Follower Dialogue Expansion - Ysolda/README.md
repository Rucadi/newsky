This mod is part of my series to renovate vanilla characters with additional depth, unique history or personality, and immersive and detailed interaction.
  
  
  
*"Now you see... without money, the world just can't run on its own. That's why 'traders' like us exist."*
  
  
  
**How is Ysolda envisioned and touched on in this mod:**
  
  
In this mod, Ysolda is expanded as a **young businesswoman with a dark secret**: she operates a dangerous drug trade, selling Sleeping Tree Sap to Whiterun and beyond. For Ysolda, **wealth comes above all else - morals and ethics included.** Having endured the torment of hunger and poverty as a child, she **vows never to starve again, no matter the cost.**
  
  
Ysolda's story begins with her father, an alchemist for a Skooma cartel. When cartel conflicts led to his death, Ysolda and her mother were left to beg on the streets. Her mother eventually succumbed to an illness that could have been cured - if only they had the gold. The only kindness Ysolda received during this time came from a Khajiit caravan, which made Ysolda trusting to the Khajiit but cynical to everything else; and above all, she values money more than anything so that she never have to starve a day again.
  
  
**Can you fix her?**
  
  
In this mod, Ysolda first appears as an eager, gentle aspiring merchant, but as you uncover the truth about her, you'll discover her darker side: a selfish, cynical drug dealer who will do anything for profit. Despite her flaws, she can be a valuable companion, **adding a buff that gives you better prices when she's around** and supporting you in combat with her skills in daggers and archery.
  
  
**Ysolda is not a follower in vanilla Skyrim, but this mod allows you to recruit her** by finding out about her Sleeping Tree Sap business, bringing her a mammoth tusk, and persuading her to join you on your adventures (even if it might not be more profitable at the first glance).
  
  
  
*Ysolda is who Holly White from Breaking Bad might grow up to be.*

Not at the moment. If I add it in the future, it will be optional.
  
  
7. Will there ever be an AIO for FDE series?
  
Extremely unlikely because I don't want to maintain two versions. You can download all FDE mods in one go using [collection](https://next.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/collections/uu3kpb/revisions/2?utm_source=copy&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=share_collection&utm_source=copy&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=share_collection).
  
  
8. Is the part where she is a drug dealer canon?
  
Yes, it is in the vanilla game.
  
  
9. What if I use a mod that already makes her a follower?
  
Compatible, but you need to do the recruitment dialogue added by FDE to get her new dialogues.
  
  
10. How do I make her a follower?
  
Complete the mammoth tusk quest and discover her Sleeping Tree Sap business (check the video).
