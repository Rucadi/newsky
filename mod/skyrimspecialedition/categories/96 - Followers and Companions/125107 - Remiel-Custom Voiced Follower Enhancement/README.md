# Remiel-Custom Voiced Follower Enhancement
- Author: PLSET
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/125107


**This mod is a comprehensive adjustment and overhaul of Remiel's and Scrap's combat capabilities and other aspects. While the original author did not design Remiel as a "combat-focused" follower, my adjustments make her more suitable for accompanying players in late-game scenarios on Legendary difficulty, especially with enemy-enhancing mods installed.**

(Important: Make sure your Remiel mod is the latest version)
  
（This mod is ESL marked, no need to take up precious ESP slot）
  
  
  
**Remiel's Overhaul:**
  
[\*]**Attribute Boost:** Overall increase in Health, Magicka, and Stamina compared to the original.
  
[\*]
  
  
[\*]**Level Scaling:** Changed from 0.7 to 1.0, matching the player's level.
  
[\*]
  
  
[\*]**Default Level:** Adjusted to level 20, with a minimum level of 20 and no level cap.
  
[\*]
  
  
[\*]**Skill Perks:** Added basic perks (Block, One-Handed, Sneak, Archery).
  
[\*]
  
  
[\*]**Equipment Adjustments:** Default armor values have been tweaked.
  
[\*]

[\*]
  
  
[\*]**Bonus Abilities:** Starting from level 20, Remiel gains 100 Health and 50 Stamina every 10 levels, up to level 80.
  
[\*]
  
  
[\*]**Magicka Increase:** +100 Magicka, though it's not particularly useful for a non-mage like Remiel. However, it prevents issues with summoning Scrap due to insufficient Magicka.
  
[\*]**Skill Enhancements:** Remiel’s Sneak, Lockpicking, and Pickpocket skills are now set to 100, fitting her role as a master thief. (These may be leveraged by other mods despite being less impactful for NPCs.)
  
[\*]
  
  
[\*]**Healing Spell Enhancement:** Remiel's Fast Healing and Heal Other spells will heal more health as her level increases, up to level 100.
  
[\*]
  
  
[\*]**Combat Style Optimization:** Remiel will now focus more on circling and engaging enemies while blocking incoming attacks,Use healing spells when her health is low, and she can contain the enemy as long as she doesn't get killed instantly.
  
﻿
  
  **New Mechanics:**

  
* **Toggle via Dialogue:** Switch these mechanics on and off through new dialogue options.
**Auto Recall of Scrap Post-Battle:** Scrap will be automatically recalled after combat ends.
  
* **Retreat and Heal:** Remiel will retreat and heal herself when her health falls below 40%.
**Combat Coordination:** Scrap will now target the same enemies as Remiel, enhancing their teamwork in combat.
  
  
   **Dialogue Adjustments:**

  
* **Scrap Combat Dialogue:** Relevant combat dialogue only triggers when Scrap is summoned. Some combat taunts have been adjusted, such as avoiding inappropriate lines like "Stay still, and I'll give you a shave!" when fighting Dwemer Centurions.
**Removed Inappropriate Retreat Dialogue.**
  
* **Quest Skip Conditions:** The introduction quest now requires level 20 to prevent players from recruiting Remiel too early.
**Feedback and Further Optimization:** I've only adjusted a small portion of the dialogue, so there’s likely more that needs tweaking. Feedback is appreciated.
  

  
**Unique Equipment:**

  
* Remiel now has six unique pieces of equipment, each with unique enchantments and models. The tuning fork also has a new model. All of Remiel's unique weapons and armor (excluding the amulet, which provides no armor value) can be improved, making smithing skills crucial. (The tuning fork is not considered a weapon and cannot be improved.)

  
* **Dagger**

[/list]**Aetherial Equipment**:

  
* [list]
Like the player, Remi is also lucky enough to have one of the three Aetherial artifacts that belong to her. You will find what you **need** in the final scene of "**Lost to the Ages**". It will be up to you to forge it, and you will need to have strong forging skills, which will greatly improve Remi's combat skills and will also determine Remi's position in the battle later. Choose carefully.
  
* After completing the "Lost to the Ages", take the equipment（Amulet, dagger, shield） you want to upgrade for Remi and upgrade it at the Aetherium Forge.

**Scrap Overhaul**[size=4]:[list]

**Lore Addition:** Added a note at Scrap's initial meeting location explaining that Scrap is a powerful "prototype." (Remiel sure is lucky to have found a legendary pet!)
  
* **Unique Appearance:** Initially in a broken state when first encountered, Scrap gains a more distinctive appearance after being repaired by Remiel.
**Overall Stat Boosts:** Scrap’s Health, Magicka, and Stamina now increase with level, along with additional resistances, Magicka absorption, unarmed damage, and lightning resistance.

(LVL = Scrap’s level is increased by completing the task of taking Remiel to explore the ruins, with a total of 5 levels.)[/list][/size][/list]**Installation & Uninstallation**

  
* **Installation**: Use a mod manager to install,
**Uninstallation**: Use a mod manager to uninstall.
  

  
**Fomod Installation Options:**

  
* **Remiel's MCO Moveset:** If you use MCO, SCAR, and have the required setup, you can choose this option. It includes a mix of ER Sword and dagger movesets, with 10 PA and NA, each with 1.2x speed annotations. I’m also open to contributions for a more flashy and fitting MCO moveset for Remiel.
**Remiel Fear Animation Replacement:** Replaces the head-clutching fear animation with a simple crouch, making it look better during low health retreats. Requires DAR or OAR support.
  
* **Scrap Silent Idle Animation:** If you want to let Scrap roam while Remiel is resting, this is a good option. It quiets the idle sounds, which can be especially noisy with sound replacement mods installed. Requires DAR or OAR support.
  
**Appearance Patch Fomod:**
  
Currently, there are only three patches available. As more patches are added, updates will become more cumbersome. If you choose to create your own patches, remember to drag the updated content every time you update.
  
  
**Compatibility：**

  
* **Incompatible Mods:** Not compatible with any mods that adjust Remiel's appearance or Scrap's records. Compatibility patches may be required.
**Patch Support:** I may create patches for some appearance mods, but don't expect too much—my time is limited. The best solution is for the appearance mod authors to create their own patches.
  
* **Mid-Game Installation:** Can be installed mid-game. Remember to take back any items given to Remiel and dismiss her, then leave her current cell to avoid issues.
**Uninstallation Process:** Similar steps as installation. Take back any items given to Remiel and dismiss her, then leave her current cell to avoid issues.
  

**Updates：**

  
* **Major Updates:** Some larger updates may require uninstalling the mod, saving the game, then reloading with the updated mod. Ensure you take back any items given to Remiel and dismiss her, leave her current cell, save the game, and then update the mod to avoid issues. These steps help ensure ESL Mod Form IDs don’t cause problems. If you’ve already forged Remiel’s Aetherial Artifacts or improved her equipment, you may need to start over.
**Simplified Updates:** You can skip the "uninstall mod, save game, reload with updated mod" part, and just do "take back any items given to Remiel, dismiss her, leave her current cell, save game, then update mod" as long as no issues arise.
