This is a small patch that I made for myself to make these two amazing dialogue expansions just a bit more cohesive.
  
  
**Vanilla Follower Expansion** (VFE) stores all its new dialogue options under a new sub-topic - "I'd like to ask you some questions."﻿
  
  
**Follower Dialogue Expansion**(FDE), on the other hand, has its﻿ new dialogue options on the top menu mixed with all regular options and follower commands.
  
  
This patch will move FDE's questions into VFE's "I'd like to ask you some questions.", while also making placement adjustments and mixing both VFE's and FDE's dialogues together in a way that should provide a naturally flowing conversation through both mods' dialogues should you choose to go through it all at once.
  
  
It just felt a bit off to me having some personal questions tucked away while also having some on the top menu. Not sure if that's something that would bother anyone else, but I'm always happy making cross-mod synergy. I also think it's nice to tuck FDE's away with VFE's to reduce dialogue clutter.
