Bjorn is not just another rough mercenary of Skyrim, despite his scars and serious gaze, there is more to this Nord than meets the eye. Born and raised in the frigid regions of Skyrim, Bjorn's life has never been easy. From the tragic loss of his family to the harsh realities of the mercenary life, nothing has been able to dampen his spirit in his fight for justice, to make Skyrim a better place for all, even if it means shedding blood along the way. As long as he has your trust, Bjorn will maintain his loyalty, always ready to lend a hand. Though he has a troubled past, he still possesses a heart of gold that understands the meaning of honor.
