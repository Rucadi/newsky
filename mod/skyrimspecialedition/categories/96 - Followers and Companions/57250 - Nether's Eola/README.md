**Nether's Eola**

﻿![](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/57250/57250-1634674385-1836856916.jpeg)﻿

  
A wickedly macabre, darkly humorous re-imagination of Skyrim's Eola. Features an enhanced, tweaked follower with plenty of options, an additional follower by the way of Nimphaneth (wood elf cannibal necromancer), extensive idle interactions between Eola and Nimph (if you use them both), harvesting of "tasty meat" from recently killed humanoids (can be used as potent food by cannibals or enhanced with discoverable reciples), and additional lootable skulls that you can collect to gain blessings from Namira.
  
  
**Note**: This mod is intended to be tongue in cheek, much like the sarcasm of the "Addams Family" movies, 80's and 90's quippy horror, and expand upon elements introduced in the game. It does play with necromancy and cannibalism in a humorous way and should not be taken seriously. Some lines spoken by Eola and Nimphaneth have adult context or play with modernisms and movie references. While this mod focuses on humor, both followers are very capable as in-game companions.
  
  
The overall goal of this series of mods is to further expand vanilla characters introduced in the game and give them a unique feel, even between different NPCs that utilize the same voice actor.
  
  
**REQUIREMENTS:**- Dawnguard and Dragonborn must be installed and active in your load order.
  
- SKSE64
  
- SkyUI (there is an MCM for followers provided)
  
- UNP or CBBE-based body (vanilla body is not supported)
  
- OPTIONAL High Poly Head requires High Poly Head 1.4 by KouLeifoh (at least the base mod)
  
  
**RECOMMENDED:**- XP32 Maximum Skeleton Extended
  
- A multi-follower manager is recommended if you want to use Eola and the bonus follower, Nimphaneth, together. NFF, AFT, EFF and frameworks based on the vanilla dialogue follower system are supported. This mod is more fun with both Eola and Nimphaneth together as a pair.
  
  
**INSTALLATION:**- Fomod Installer (supports SSE only).
  
- Choose your Head Type (High Poly or Standard)
  
- Choose the type of Eola Replacer (supports Nether's Eola as seen in mod screenshots, Eola from Bijin Warmaidens, Eola from Coldsun's Creations, and Vanilla (also choose this option if you use Fresh Faces). Nimphaneth will still use the head and hair options from this mod.
  
- Choose your Body Type (CBBE or UNP)
  
- Choose Eola's Hair Color (only if you selected Nether's Eola) - Blonde, Red or Silver.
  
- Choose Nimphaneth's Hair Color - Brown, Red or Black.
  
- Choose Eola's Eye Option (only if you selected Nether's Eola) - Left Eye Blind or Left Eye Grey.
  
  
**HIGHLIGHTS:**- Enhanced version of Eola with custom perks, combat style and ability to select which spells she can use and her overall power (via the MCM).
  
- Additional Nimphaneth follower with custom spells, perks, combat style and ability to select which spells she can use and her overall power (via the MCM).
  
- Both followers include lots of unique, custom dialogue and idles. If you use both followers via a multi-follower manager, they will interact with each other - for this reason, it's a lot more fun if you use them both together.
  
- Easily assign up to 5 outfits and easily switch between them.
  
- "Tasty Meat" can be harvested from bodies that cannibals (including player) can use as health food. You can discover 12 additional recipes for turning this food into more potent versions, some with special effects.
  
- Collectables - You can find special skulls in boss chests, 25 in total. For every 5 collected, you can gain a blessing from Namira (bonus to Health, Magicka or Stamina - your choice). Multiple choices from gaining more skulls can stack.
  
- Customize mod features via the MCM menu. Yes, you can turn off features you don't like.
  
  
**GENERAL:**- Offers Eola as an enhanced, improved follower once the "Taste of Death" quest has completed. You can use this mod whether you have completed the quest or haven't started it yet.
  
- Taste of Death is a vanilla quest that starts near the Hall of the Dead in Markarth. After the quest is complete, you may find Eola in Reachcliff Cave, if you have completed this some time ago in your current game.
  
- This mod offers and additional follower, Nimphaneth, a wood elf cannibal necromancer that is expanded from the vanilla version. In all respects she works like an additional or alternative follower once Eola is obtainable. This mod doesn't provide multiple follower support but works with multiple follower managers and there is extra interaction idles if both followers are with you at the same time. If Nimphaneth was killed during Taste of Death, going into the MCM and unchecking Allow Nimphaneth and then re-checking it will resurrect her.
  
  
**What if I don't want to be a Cannibal?**- Do Namira's quest but don't engage in cannibalism. However, Nimph and Eola are cannibals. You can toggle many of the features of this mod to configure it to your own "tastes" or you can not use the mod if you are bothered by it.
  
  
**Does this support Namira For Good Guys?**- Yes, you can trick Namira if your character is morally obligated. However, Nimph and Eola will remain as they are designed. See above.
  
  
**I don't want to do the quest, can I just have Eola?**No, do the quest. It takes like 10 minutes. It is one of the quickest quests to obtain a capable follower (even under a pure Vanilla aesthetic).

**APPEARANCE:**- Modernizes but keeps the aesthetic style Eola and Nimphaneth.
  
- Scultped face, customized face overlay.
  
- Choice of multiple hair colors in the installer. For Eola: Blonde, Red and Silver. For Nimphaneth: Brown, Black and Red.
  
- Includes face, brow and eye textures. Eye textures are custom created.
  
- Eola has a blind left eye (lore friendly) but there is option for both eyes grey.
  
- Includes head and body maps (UNP and CBBE based bodies). Attention to seams between body parts.
  
- There are two different texture sets and both are hand-tweaked. The UNP texture uses Fair Skin Complexion while the CBBE uses a combination of Fair Skin and Pure Skin.
  
  
**VOICE AND RELATIONSHIP:**- Eola and Nimph have many customized voice lines - a combination of the VA Synth tool and in-game lines that are re-appropriated. All are tweaked in Audacity. These include a variety of different lines, such as: idles, interactions, hellos, goodbyes and combat.
  
- Several lines will change or be added, based on the built-in Relationship system.
  
- Relationship system that increases in time and when fighting beside them. Starts at Friendly and progresses to Interested and Enamored. At Enamored, they can be married. Each "level" is based on a point system. Just spending time gets you around 100 points a day. Takes around 300 points, total, to get to enamored.
  
- Nimph and Eola can engage in banter with each other as idles. Nearly 60 are included and some have randomized variety built into them.
  
- Idle lines will be postponed while the player is in conversation with an NPC.
  
- They can sometimes comment when the player loots a body or loots a boss chest.
  
- They can both warn the player by talking to them, if sick, low on health potions or low on lockpicks.
  
- There are a lot of puns and comedy built into the lines. Some are sexually suggestive. You can turn off either of these types of lines in the MCM if you wish. They aren't going to say nearly as much if you do.
  
  
**GAMEPLAY:**+ Shared Abilities and Features +
  
- Improved Heath, Stamina, Magicka (but not over the top).
  
- Both level with the player, indefinately.
  
- Improved Combat Styles. Spellsword for Eola, fights with right hand, casts with the left. Full spellcaster build for Nimphaneth.
  
- You can turn on or off spells that come with them in the MCM, to customize what they use.
  
- Both Eola and Nimphaneth are Protected. You can make them essential or turn off these options to make them killable in game.
  
- Power Boost - Spells are increased in magnitude by 10% starting at level 10 and every 10 levels, up to level 100.
  
- Exclude Summon in Interiors - As there can be limited space in interior spaces and minions can block hallways or otherwise get in the way, you can cause any summons by Eola or Nimphaneth to only occur outdoors.
  
- Link Damage Multiplier to Magnitude - Physical Damage Multiplier is linked to Magnitude of Destruction spells. This allows you to weaken or strengthen both followers in the MCM menu by adjusting their damage multiplier.
  
  
**++ Eola ++**
  
**Voice**: Female Sultry
  
**Personality**: Confident and capable. Devout to Namira. Admiration of the player.
  
**Likes**: Vampires, depravity, wickedness and all the things Namira stands for.
  
**Dislikes**: Priests (except for dinner) and draugr.
  
**Base Spells** (all left handed):
  
- Firebolt, Fireball, Incinerate, Lighting Bolt, Chain Lightning, Thunderbolt, Close Wounds, Fast Healing, Oakflesh, Stoneflesh, Steadfast Ward, Conjure Flame Atronach, Raise Zombie, Reanimate Corpse.
  
**Perks**:
  
- Savage Strike, Magic Resistance, Augmented Flames, Augmented Shock, Recovery, Regeneration, Armsman 2, Mage Armor.
  
**Special Abilities**:
  
- Strike from the Shadows (perk) - Attacks from 1-handed weapons (used in the right hand) have an increased critical hit chance of 15% and cause 150% of the weapon's critical hit damage. Only can be done in dark or shadowed areas (light level of 60 or lower).
  
- Hunt the Living (perk) - Eola inflicts 15% extra damage with spells or weapons to any living, humanoid targets.
  
- Vicious (perk) - Eola causes light bleeding damage (3 points per second over 4 seconds) with 1-handed attacks and can occasionally (25%) stagger opponents. Power Boost affects bleeding damage.
  
  
**++ Nimphaneth ++**
  
**Voice**: Female Young Eager
  
**Personality**: Uncertain about her abilities, aloof and a bit airheaded (I modeled her after me).
  
**Likes**: Spiders, darkness and pontificating in her own special way.
  
**Dislikes**: Vampires (will not act directly hostile to them).
  
**Base Spells** (all left handed):
  
- Oakflesh, Close Wounds, Lesser Ward, Greater Ward.
  
**Base Perks**:
  
- Recovery, Summoner, Twin Souls.
  
**Special Abilities**:
  
- Wild Magic (spell ability) - Nimphaneth's offensive spells are unpredictable, sometimes freely casting an additional projectile or causing her casting to fizzle. When an additional projectile is fired, it is usually a copy of a spell she is already casting. However, if she is using Ice Spike, there is a 25% chance she will instead cast an ice volley that explodes and does damage to hostile targets within 15 yards. When her casting fizzles, she is silenced for 3 seconds and is unable to cast any spells.
  
Note: the additional spell fired will work on any aimed spell that Nimph knows, even if you teach her different spells though another mod. However, the ice volley only occurs with ice spike and only using right-handed casting (to balance the ability). These chances can be tweaked in the MCM.
  
Improved Ice Spike (spell) - Nimph can cast an improved version of ice spike from either hand, that saves versus magic resistance instead of frost. This makes it effective against most enemies. However, it does slightly less damage that the regular ice spike spell and takes a half-second to cast.
  
- Summon Shade (spell) - Nimph can summon a shade (skeleton) that can manifest as an archer or warrior, and sometimes as a more powerful dark priest. Archers and Warriors scale to 80% of her level and Priests equal her level. Nimph can only have one Shade summoned at a time, even though she has the Twin Souls perk.
  
- Raise Animal (spell) - Nimph is only able to raise animals back from the dead. However, they do last twice as long as normal reanimations.
  
- Efficient Wards (perk) - Nimph can cast and maintain words at half their magicka cost.
  
  
**+ Outfit System +**You can create up to 5 outfits for Eola and Nimph, via dialogue. When the first outfit is created, it will automatically be worn. Additional outfits can be worn by asking them to wear them.
  
It is recommended that you keep all of their wearable items in their extra storage inventory, which is an unlimited storage space. This is to keep Skyrim's engine from accidentally overwriting any loose wearable items, which might be represented in the same body slot as an outfit item.
  
In the MCM you can assign a hotkey that can be used to switch to any outfits defined for them. If a specific follower is in the crosshair, it will only affect that follower. Otherwise, both will be affected if an outfit is defined in the slot you select.
  
In the MCM, you can also activate an Outfit Preview Mode. This moves their inventory around temporarily to allow them to be treated as if you are directly trading the items to them so that they wear them in real time. This setting does move items around to a temporary container.
  
  
**+ Home System +**Via dialogue, you can define a home location for each follower. You can choose a base location and once that is defined, you can additional choose between day (6am to 2pm) and night (10pm to 6am) locations. You can also choose which times they sleep (6am, 2pm or 10pm). Sleep lasts for 6 hours and they must be able to find an unowned bed.
  
  
**+ Extension to Cannibal and Necromancy +**- Expands Cannibalism to allow "tasty meat" to be harvested from bodies (random drop, chance can be adjusted in the MCM). This can be used like potions (food) on any cannibal faction character. Raw tasty meat restores 35 health.
  
- You can find (12) additional Tasty Meat recipes throughout the world in boss chests. Picking up the recipe teaches it to you and allows it to be available at the cooking station. These can produce increased resistances (for an hour) or heal Health, Stamina or Magicka.
  
- Eola and Nimph can feast on a dead body after a kill, increasing their health and health regen for a few minutes. Only can occur once per hour. Currently, they randomly take turns feasting after combat has ended.
  
- The player can sometimes find and collect special skulls (bronze, chrome, copper, ebony and opal) from boss chests. There are 25 in total. For every 5 found (of any type) will grant a Blessing of Namira, allowing the player to choose to increase Health, Stamina or Magicka by 30. These bonuses stack and you can mix and match blessings (for example, if you find 15 skulls you can pick health twice and stamina once). Finding all 25 skulls also grants a perk point.
  
  
**+ Changes to Taste of Death and Reachcliff Cave +**- For compatibility, the quest itself is left unscathed. I did add an additional invisible bomb (conditional trigger) that kills all enemies in a large radius when you bring the priest back to be sacrificed in the hallway right before you get to the cannibal chamber. There is a game bug where the entire cannibal coven will turn on you if enemies are in the room and mods that spawn additional enemies can make this worse. So I just kill them. It doesn't affect any cannibals or followers.
  
- Should be compatible with Namira for Good Guys or cannibalism mods. If you bring someone back to be sacrificed other than the priest via a mod, the trigger will not fire off to fix the enemies bug.
  
- Once Eola is your follower you can take a key from her inventory that opens a trap door to the outside. You can quickly go back and forth from the outside to the cannibal room. This is in place for future features.
  
  
**MCM SUPPORT:**- Toggle all of Eola and Nimphaneth's spells so you can customize what they use.
  
- Set Power Scaling (destruction magnitude and physical damage multiplier) of both, up to 200% (or weaken them). Works on spells you give them through other mods.
  
- Set Conjuration spells to work in interiors (or not). Works on spells you give them through other mods.
  
- See status of Taste of Death Quest.
  
- See status of Relationship with Eola, you can set it to whatever rank you want to.
  
- Toggle both Essential or Protected.
  
- Set chance of Tasty Meat dropping from bodies.
  
- Allow them to feast on dead bodies (or not).
  
- Enable Nimphaneth follower (will resurrect if dead).
  
- Tweak frequency and chance of commentary (chance is done on a "per line" basis).
  
- Enable Lewd comments - these are more suggestive - some are right out there. None are downright filthy. Still pretty lore friendly.
  
- Enable Humor comments - silly references and jokes, pretty lore friendly. There is a fair amount of humor so disabling this may greatly reduce available lines.
  
  
**PHASE ONE:**- Nether's Eola is in a Phase One stage, where a complete follower package is released with interactions and some additional gameplay elements.
  
- Phase Two will expand on what is in place already and has a goal of adding quest content. This mod has been in the works for many months and I wanted to provide a cutoff point for now to allow a Halloween release.
  
- I have no interest of trying to ESL a file of this size, which I'm likely to expand. I firmly believe ESL should be for simpler mods that are unlikely to change very much.
  
- Occasionally Nimphaneth or Eola will not feed on a body or the feeding animation will not fire. There are usually plenty of additional opportunities for this in a play session. They will also feed on dead vampires, because... sure.
