***What is a Revenant?***
  
  
In folklore, a revenant is an animated corpse that is believed to have been revived from death to haunt the living. The word revenant is derived from the Old French word revenant 'returning' (see also the related French verb revenir 'to come back').
  
  
Revenants are part of the legend of various cultures, including Old Irish Celtic and Norse mythology, and stories of supposed revenant visitations were documented by English historians in the Middle Ages.
  
  
This mod was initially released for Halloween 2021 and this version is the most up-to-date with some new features and a new look.
  
  
She can be found after you speak to Kalf, an old man currently residing in the Old Hroldan Inn. He'll tell you a story and give you a book. Read the book! It has The Revenant's backstory in it and will flesh out the character more for you as you play.
  
  
Karla Raven, The Revenant, was voiced by Kersten Unger ([Kikiapplus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/25537454)) from assets she released for public use in the [Custom Voice Resource](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29227).  A big thank you goes to my friend [Damakarmelowa](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5189388) for helping me with some of the Creation Kit work needed to complete this mod.

[color=#cbd5e1][size=3]The Revenant is extremely powerful. At low levels she will decimate your enemies, but from mid-to-high levels her abilities will even out nicely and the game will be challenging for you (if you only use one follower). She works great with higher difficulty mods/settings.
