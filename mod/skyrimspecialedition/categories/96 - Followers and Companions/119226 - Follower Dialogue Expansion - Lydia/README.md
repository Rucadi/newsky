This mod is part of my series to renovate vanilla characters with additional depth, unique history or personality, and immersive and detailed interaction.
  
  
  
*"I knew the innkeep of Sleeping Giant was up to something. Every time I went to Riverwood, she only served me spoiled milk!"*
  
  
  
**How is Lydia envisioned and touched on in this mod:**
  
  
In this mod, Lydia is expanded as a **dependable, neutral, and religious Housecarl who is deeply loyal to the player.** She is focused on the present and believes in your leadership wholeheartedly. Wherever you go, she will follow - as her sworn duty demands.
  
  
Lydia's story begins as a struggling mercenary in Whiterun, where **she found herself overshadowed by the Companions.** Her fortunes changed when she took on an escort job for Erandur, who taught her Mara's doctrines during their journey to Dawnstar. Inspired by his teachings, **Lydia became deeply religious** and embarked on a pilgrimage to Mara's Temple in Riften.
  
  
The chaos in Riften made her realize she should answer a higher calling, therefore she joined Jarl Balgruuf's service instead - until Balgruuf assigned her to you, and she swore to protect the Thane of Whiterun.
  
  
**What? She could've joined the Companions for the good jobs?** She hates alcohol... and she could smell the "stench" of mead from the stairs below Jorrvaskr!
  
  
**Lydia also has a strong rivalry against Jenassa,** because Jenassa took a good job from the East Empire Company while she was left with scraps, whereas Jenassa sees Lydia as an unnecessary burden to the party, ironically.
  
  
You can recruit Lydia after completing the main quest "Dragon Rising".
  
  
In the mod, Lydia has a **neutral, gentle demeanor, a weird sense of humor, with a pious and simple worldview.** She is not as opinionated as the other followers in the series, but she would follow you to the end of the world.

**Features:**
  
1. Expands Lydia with 300 lines, all voiced by high quality AI (see the video for reference)
  
2. Quest awareness for the Companions questline, vanilla main quest and DLC main quest
  
3. New story-driven interactions
  
4. New romantic lines if she is married
  
5. Location-awareness, including cities and dungeons
  
6. Completely lore-friendly
  
7. She comments on a few vanilla followers such as Mjoll and Jordis
  
8. Banter with [Jenassa](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120255), [Erik](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/116719)9. Immerse into your game world as a character who lives in it, rather than taking over the show
  
  
This mod is **100% compatible with any mod** **EXCEPT IFD Lydia** which gave her a new voice and new story.
  
  
**Safe to add mid-save.**
  
  
There is a potential for **future expansion** with Lydia including **optional** synergy with the overarching Shezarrine Saga
