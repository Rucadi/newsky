**Xelzaz, Lawman of House Telvanni**
  
Xelzaz is an excellent alchemist and chef, and in return for taking him with you he will cook you a warm meal twice a day, as well a powerful potion of your choice each day. He will occasionally provide cynical commentary on quests from an Argonian as well as Telvanni perspective. While he has the air of Telvanni arrogance, he is quite relatable and friendly. A proud Argonian from Thorn, he will occasionally speak in Jel and reminisce on both Morrowind and Black Marsh. He currently has over 8500 lines and has a full commentary on the Main Quest, Dawnguard, College of Winterhold, The Dark Brotherhood, The Companions, The Thieves Guild as well as other quests and quest-lines. He has his own personal quests, with more to come!

**Interactions with other Followers**
  
If you want to get the full experience with Xelzaz, I highly recommend running him with other custom followers. Each interaction explores different aspects of both Xelzaz and the other follower, allowing for a more immersive party, and a deeper delve into both characters. Some companions also have three-way interactions when all in a party with Xelzaz.

**Vision**
  

I created Xelzaz with the goal in mind of setting him apart from other followers. I wanted someone who saw you as an equal. Not worshiping the ground you walk on, being edgy and mysterious or a love interest. I wanted a follower that was unique and could bring a new perspective on the world around him. I wanted a companion that would be a boon to you, not just for company, but also being genuinely helpful. This brought the addition of him cooking you food, as well as powerful potions. Xelzaz is intended to have interactions with all the base game content, as well as the Creation Club/AE content, but most importantly, I wanted him to have interactions with mods that I myself enjoy. I intend to have interactions with mods as I continue working on him, however content that is available to everyone has a priority.

**Xelzaz's Backstory**
  

Xelzaz grew up in Thorn, north east in Black Marsh. As a child he proved himself to have the potential to be a very skilled alchemist. A Telvanni Tower Alchemist made him a hireling, as she had too much work to do herself. So he came on as her assistant. Xelzaz saw this as an opportunity to improve his skills. He'd have access to a lab as well as a conservatory and rare ingredients. He would move to Llothanis, in Tel Sul under Master Sul. Over the years climbed the ranks of House Telvanni, as the Telvanni in his tower grew to respect him and saw not only his skills be very useful, but also his abilities as an Argonian. Disease resistance, poison resistance, they could send him into Black Marsh to get things that would be far too deadly for any Dunmer to do. While the rest of House Telvanni views Xelzaz with distaste, his own circle held him in high regard. As it is with House Telvanni, Master Sul would end up assassinated, which would crush Xelzaz as he had gained so much respect for his Master. He moved to Port Telvannis, figuring the de facto capital of House Telvanni would be an excellent place to find a new Master to become a Mouth for, in order to advance. Of course this was not the case. People mostly just gave him simple jobs that he was fit for. He would then hear word of a Telvanni Master without a Mouth that did not have reservations against Argonians. Master Helseth Ren, who is away in Rivenspire to research the Ayleid Ruins of the Doomcrag. He therefore decided to travel to High Rock from Morrowind, and along the way he would do field research and network with people. Just as he crosses the border into Skyrim, he spots an adventurer approaching...

**Recruitment**
  

You can find Xelzaz by the Southern Morrowind Gate. This is located east of Dayspring Canyon and north east of Stendarr's Beacon. Speak with him and he will introduce himself. You may find a note on the bar in the Bee and Barb talking about Xelzaz. If you pick up the note you get a quest to go find him. Please note: If you plan to play Dawnguard on the side of the Volkihar Clan, recruit and bring Xelzaz along when you join them. Otherwise he will leave your game. If you are using an older version of Skyrim, please install [BEES](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441)﻿.

**Xelzaz's Themes**

  
  
**Recommendations**
  
It is safe to install Xelzaz mid playthrough. I have tried to limit any comments that would indicate Xelzaz was there for any quests you completed without him, but some lines may have slipped through the net. Occasionally he will have something to say about the current quest you are on, the area you are in or other conditions. 
  
  
**Feedback**Feedback is very welcome, if you run into any issues, have any recommendations, ideas or just have something to say, please feel free to get it touch on Discord or make a post here. Currently I plan on updating Xelzaz every time there is significant progress made, this would for example be the completion of commentary for a quest line or the addition of Xelzaz's own quests. I will try to keep updates common, but substantial.

**Things to Note**If you experience issues with Xelzaz and your load order includes mods that alter follower behavior, or other behaviors for NPCs like altering the idle chance. I will not be supporting these load orders, should you encounter issues.
  
Xelzaz does have a script that blacklists him from AFT, however any load orders that still run AFT or the like will be dismissed due to the fact these measures may fail, either due to the load order itself, or due to AFT or similar deciding to manage Xelzaz anyway.
