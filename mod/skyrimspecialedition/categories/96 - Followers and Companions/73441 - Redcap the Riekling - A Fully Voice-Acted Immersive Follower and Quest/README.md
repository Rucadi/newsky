[/font]**Overview**

﻿

﻿![](https://i.imgur.com/Q26by9s.png)﻿

  

Redcap is a voice-acted & immersive Riekling follower with **over 2650 lines of lore-friendly dialogue** (with much more planned), a fully fleshed-out backstory, **several original quests** that build on existing Skyrim characters and locations, **many unique, useful, & entertaining features and mechanics** **\*see Features section below\***, and a big personality that makes him MUCH more than what you would expect from a Riekling.  Redcap is inspired by custom mod followers like Inigo (who he has banter and interactions with!) and Lucien Flavius, and is \*NOT\* an animal follower or a joke/gag character; he has his own thoughts, opinions, personality, & genuine character development with at times serious & impactful themes, and will comment, react to, & actively get involved in many things throughout your adventures, including choices you make!  He also has a unique & fully custom appearance (which is explained in dialogue and in his personal quest) including a high quality new 3D model and custom textures for his helmet along with new textures for his skin, hair, armor, eyes, etc, and has his own custom follower framework meaning he can be used alongside ANY and all other followers (from mods or vanilla), some of which he will have interactions and commentary with!

  
  

[font=Verdana]﻿[/font]**Location & Backstory**

  

You will find Redcap locked in the basement of Anise's Cabin (a short walk north of the Guardian Stones) **There is an immersive roleplay reason to investigate Anise's Cabin added to the Sleeping Giant Inn in Riverwood for players who feel there isn't enough reason to break into an old woman's basement.**
  
  
Redcap expands on the character of Anise by giving her new dialogue that plays out both in a scene with Redcap and with new dialogue with the player, along with details of her true purpose and experiments in a journal you will find in her basement when first meeting Redcap.  Anise is no longer a small, random encounter, but a true villain who may even have more of a role to play in the future...(if Anise is already dead when you recruit Redcap, you will still be able to recruit him and progress his quest as usual, you will just miss out on some unique dialogue and scenes that add a lot to the experience of the mod)
  
  
Redcap's unique appearance and ability to communicate more effectively than most Rieklings is lore-friendly, and explained both in dialogue and in Anise's Journal.  The inspiration for his name, appearance, and backstory is based on the redcaps from Dungeons & Dragons who are fey creatures often acting in the service of Hags or witches.

**FULL LIST OF REDCAP'S ORIGINAL QUESTS:** Spoiler
  
Redcap's Main Questline

New Daedric Prince Quests
  
- **The Red God** (requires A Night to Remember to have been completed \*Redcap does not have to have been present for ANTR but dialogue will reflect if he was\*, unlocks a unique Daedric artifact for Redcap and a pool of new general dialogue)

* **A pet Bristleback boar named Bigpig** with a custom voice created with high quality recordings of real life wild boars (met and recruited during Redcap's quest) that Redcap can summon and desummon for battle [size=2]Spoiler Redcap will only summon Bigpig in battle if you choose the dialogue option in the About Bigpig... topic, this can be turned on and off at any time  OR that can be used alongside Redcap as a complete additional follower (or not at all) - either will unlock new dialogue and interactions involving Bigpig, and you can toggle these options whenever you like!  Bigpig also has a custom feeding system that will give him a temporary vitality buff when given certain foods! [/size]Spoiler You can feed Bigpig yourself using the dialogue option, or if Redcap is carrying any of the appropriate food items in his inventory he will randomly feed Bigpig around 3 times per day (or until he runs of out food) The buff temporarily raises Bigpig's maximum health, and does not stack, though additional feedings will refresh the buff's duration
**Multiple custom appearance options** via a unique custom armor system! (see combat section below)
  
* **Spearcrafting mechanic** - If Redcap runs out of spears, bring him some firewood and he can craft more! (see combat section below)
**Unique Stealth Mode** - Redcap has a unique stealth mechanic that makes him ideal for sneaky playstyles, along with stealth-specific dialogue and the ability to pick any lock! (see combat section below)
  
* **Tavern mechanic** - Give Redcap any alcoholic beverage in a tavern to unlock an entire pool of humorous drunk dialogue (he will sober up as soon as you leave the tavern!)
**Unique temporary buffs** from certain items!  Give Redcap sweet rolls to give him a sugar rush that increases his movement and attack speed for a short time Spoiler This effect stacks, giving Redcap more sweet rolls will increase the magnitude of the attack & movement speed increase. A maximum of 3 sweet rolls can be given through the dialogue option per 24 hours, though Redcap can randomly consume one additional sweet roll per day if he has one in his inventory   or Scathecraw which will give him a temporary vitality boost Spoiler This effect does not stack, and raises Redcap's maximum health for a moderate period of time. Giving him more Scathecraw will refresh the effect's duration, but not increase the amount of health the buff gives. The dialogue option to give Redcap Scathecraw will appear at a certain quest stage during the Chief of Thirsk Hall quest, though he will consume Scathecraw randomly from his inventory before that 
  
* **An equippable version of the Candlelight spell** that will remain active indefinitely when equipped, doesn't require magicka, and does not use an equipment slot.  Redcap will use the Candlelight if it is left in his inventory, or you can take it from him and use it yourself! (he may have comments about you or specific other creatures using his light...) Spoiler He will NOT be happy if you give one of the Thirsk Riekling followers his light!
**Custom Follow Distance Controls** - You can tell Redcap to follow his usual distance, stay close, or follow further away, and freely switch between these options at any time!
  
* **A summon spell** to summon Redcap to your side from anywhere (and additional dialogue when he is summoned in different situations!)
**A player home** (unlocked during Redcap's quest)

﻿**Combat**

﻿![](https://i.imgur.com/6Jw3leB.png)﻿

  
* **Redcap is a capable ranged combatant**who uses Riekling spear-throwing animations & can equip and use any bow or arrows you give him.  He has a number of Riekling throwing spears when you recruit him, and can craft more for himself if he runs out Spoiler If he has no spears in his inventory, a dialogue option will appear where you can ask him to craft spears from firewood. He can craft 50 spears per 3 firewood you give him  He is carrying an invisible bow (with lore explanation in Anise's journal) which will allow him to throw spears or arrows without seeing a bow in his other hand.  He NEEDS a bow equipped to throw spears/arrows, you can choose the invisible bow to not see one, or give him any bow of your choice which he will hold in his off hand during battle (he will also benefit from any enchantments on an equipped bow like any other follower)  Redcap will ONLY fight at range, and will not equip/use any melee weapons you give him.
**REDCAP HAS 14 CUSTOM ARMORS** that along with changing his appearance offer various passive buffs!  Most of these can be crafted after asking him about armors, but certain special armors are unlocked by completing Redcap's quests or engaging in his other special mechanics!  **Full list of armors and how to get them:**

* **Redcap has a stealth mode** that will automatically activate when the player sneaks and Redcap is following. He is entirely undetectable by enemies when in stealth mode (unless they bump into him) making Redcap an ideal companion for stealthy playstyles! There is also a lore explanation for the shadow magic that makes this stealth mode possible in Anise's Journal.
**Redcap can fight underwater!** Take him with you on underwater adventures and he can help defend you from pesky slaughterfish.
  
* [size=4]**Redcap levels with the player**, he will always be balanced and viable in combat.[/size]
[size=4]**Redcap does not affect the player's stealth detection, and will not trigger traps**[/size]
  
* [size=4]**Redcap has a friendly fire perk** that prevents him from ever accidentally damaging you.[/size]
[size=4]**Redcap is essential**; you don't have to worry about accidentally killing him.[/size]
  
* [size=4]**After Bigpig is recruited during Redcap's quest, Redcap can be asked to summon Bigpig in combat** (choose the About Bigpig... dialogue option to access)  Redcap will then summon Bigpig automatically when combat starts, and desummon him back to his pen when combat ends.  Alternatively, Bigpig can be used as a fully functioning additional follower, though he will only obey your commands if Redcap is currently following you.[/size]

  
  

[size=6]**Compatibility**[/size]

﻿![](https://i.imgur.com/pesVLbR.png)﻿

Redcap has his own unique follower framework, which means he is compatible with and can be used alongside ANY followers both from mods or the vanilla game.  He does not use the vanilla framework OR the vanilla animal follower slot in any way, and in fact has specific commentary and interactions with every vanilla animal follower if used alongside them!
  
  
Redcap, like ***every other follower with a custom framework***, is **[size=5]INCOMPATIBLE** with Amazing Follower Tweaks (AFT), as **AFT automatically imports all followers into its framework** by simply having it installed, which breaks them and causes irreparable damage to their AI on any save that AFT was present on.  *Even when a custom framework follower has a script that attempts to add the follower to AFT's blacklist and prevent it from managing them, those scripts often fail, and it only takes them failing once for AFT to infect and ruin the follower.* **So to be clear: You should \*never\* have AFT installed alongside ANY custom framework follower (Redcap or otherwise) and if you use it alongside Redcap it will break him and he will not function as intended.**Other follower frameworks, like NFF, that do not automatically import followers into their frameworks, can be installed alongside custom framework followers (including Redcap) as long as you **\*do not use them to manage custom framework followers in any way\***
  
  
**Mods that claim to "shut followers up" or reduce Idle frequency like Configurable Commentary Rate Slider should NOT be used with any mod follower**, they will break follower interactions, quest progression, and many other things by preventing important Idle lines from firing. **Idle lines are not just random chatter comments** as those mods imply, they are in fact used for many important things in follower mods, which those mods will break. All follower interaction scenes between mod followers, for example, are started through Idle lines, so if you want your followers to work properly, do not use those mods.
  
  
Redcap is incompatible with any mod that attempts to circumvent Anise dying, or expands on her character or story in any way.
  
  
Redcap adds some small additions to a single location in Solstheim outside of Redcap's Village (which is its own interior cell, won't conflict with anything, and is entirely follower-friendly), and in the unlikely event that another mod alters/adds something in that exact spot there could be conflicts. There are also some additions to one of the tiny islands near Solstheim, so again if another mod adds anything to that same spot it could conflict.  I have tested Redcap extensively with over 1500 mods in my game and have chosen locations that I do not think have been used by any other mods, but I thought it was worth noting which vanilla areas have been added on to just in case.
  
  
The bridge outside of Redcap's Village is navmeshed, and followers can walk on it.  However, there can be an issue with the entrance of the bridge when used with unmodded vanilla water where the water's current can pull followers to one side as they try to get onto the bridge.  This is unfortunately unavoidable due to the very high placement of the current pull from vanilla water, if you want to fix this entirely I suggest using Realistic Water 2 (which does not have this issue), however to help Redcap get onto the bridge/close to the Village when doing his quest while using vanilla water, you can always use his summon spell.[/size]

  
  

**Future Plans**

  

  
* More dialogue and quest commentary!  Plans to include Daedric Prince quests, full Dragonborn DLC commentary, & more
Additional Redcap quests are planned for future updates that will expand on the events of his current quest
  
* Patches for Creation Club content ~~like the Goblins quest~~ **CC Goblins Patch and Gogh Interactions up now!**
~~Patch for EVG Animated Traversal to add parkour spots to Redcap's new locations~~ **EVG Animated Traversal Addon up now in Optional Files!**
