This mod is part of my series to renovate vanilla characters with additional depth, unique history or personality, and immersive and detailed interaction.
  
  
  
*"If my mother and the Hagravens had taught me one good lesson - it's that unchecked ambition always leads to doom... but you've grown too important to me. I don't want you to share their fate."*
  
  
  
**How is Illia envisioned and touched on in this mod:**
  
  
In this mod, Illia is expanded as a **good witch who seeks redemption** from the sins of her mother. She spent much of her life secluded in Darklight Tower, and therefore understands little of the civilized world's ways; but now she has helped you end her mother's witch coven, and has no one to trust or rely on but you.
  
  
Her story begins as a child born under dark and sad circumstances, as her father was murdered by a noble who lusted after her mother. In grief and wrath, Illia's mother sold her soul and her daughter - still in her womb - to the Darklight Coven and the Daedra, just to gain vengeance on the noble. They got exactly what they asked for, and now they would spend an eternity to pay the Hagravens back.
  
  
Illia became estranged to her mother, as the crones in Darklight Tower abused her just for leisure. Despite that, she remained a good mage in defiance of the Hags and her mother, and only participated in their evil deeds when forced. At times, she would escape the tower to glimpse the world outside, but she always returned to its darkness - **for all its horrors, the tower was familiar, while the civilized world was alien.** 
  
  
Everything changed when she helped you bring down her mother's coven. **Now, with nowhere and no one else to turn to, she places her trust in you.** Will you fail her, or **redeem her from the dark world she was forced to call home?**
  
  
She is available as a follower after the completion of the quest "Repentence" in Darklight Tower. She is a frost mage with healing abilities.
  
  
In the mod, Illia has a wise demeanor with a subtle, dry sense of humor. She is grateful to you, and gratitude may grow into something much more in the form of friendship or romance.
