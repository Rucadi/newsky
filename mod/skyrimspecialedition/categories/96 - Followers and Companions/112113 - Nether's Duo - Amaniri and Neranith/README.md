**Nether's Duo - Amaniri and Neranith**
  
  
**REQUIRES:**
  
SKSE
  
<https://skse.silverlock.org/>
  
  
**MOD FEATURES:**
  
- Main follower, Amaniri, who follows the concept of a Dunmer "paladin" who follows the old Tribunal, Almalexia, Sotha Sil and Vivec. This attempts to be lore friendly (or lore adjacent) as it acknowledges that the Tribunal was defeated in Elder Scrolls: Morrowind but that Vivec may have been crafty and clever enough to foresee their defeat and somehow they could survive after their mortal shells were destroyed.
  
  
- An additional follower, Neranith, Amaniri's sister. She is a Telvanni Wizard and Researcher working under Neloth on Solstheim. Her and Amaniri have a relationship that is less than ideal but she can be hired as an additional part of your adventuring team.
  
  
- Acquistion of 3 Daedric Artifacts that strengthen Amaniri's connection to the Tribunal and make her stronger (introductory quest content). These items scale in power and have 5 ranks, with the highest rank granting an additional ability. Ranks are increased by acquiring magical Artifact Essence that can be looted from bosses, powerful enemies or those attuned to magic. These items are intended for Amaniri but can be used by you or any other follower that you wish.
  
  
- Amaniri is able to switch between 3 different Devotions, that represent each Tribunal God-King. Each has it's own special strengths and abilities. As you acquire her main Artifacts, the Devotions become Greater ones with additional features.
  
  
- You can discover additional Artifacts to pursue via notes that can found on the inventory of enemies. These Artifacts also have Ranks and are intended to offer something to other player playstyles or if you want to power up another follower a bit.
  
  
- Additional quest content where you meet Amaniri's sister and defeat the leader of the Reclaimers, an enemy group also looking for Artifacts in order to use them for their own or to destroy them.
  
  
- Optionally includes CBBE/3BA and UNP based skins to match the look of screenshots and to reduce seams. Further, pubic hair matches head hair. However, by default will use your own installed textures. The gals always use your installed body shape. You can also choose to use smooth looking faces or adopt the brow ridge that is used in vanilla for Dunmer.
  
  
- Supported in Vanilla and NFF, AFT, EFF and similar follower managers but also has a Companion system that allows them to seamlessly be used outside of any follower framework, so that you can have them in addition to other followers. They have normal follower functions plus a catch-up teleport (so that they don't get lost) and a sandboxing system. The latter features can be toggled on an off.
  
  
- There is a ton of stuff crammed into a single ESL that covers 2 followers. I may expand this content at a future date with an additional ESL.
  
  
- Amaniri (and Neranith) are intended as spiritual successors to what I can't do with Frea. Amaniri values her faith and learns to become more accustomed to family.
  
  
  
**CAVEATS:**
  
- There is a friendly nod to the Ghosts of the Tribunal creation, but this mod isn't Anniversary Edition specific. I started fleshing out the concepts and ideas without even looking at the CC offering.
  
- This dips into Morrowind lore and is hopefully lore-adjacent enough to work out for most players.
  
- Neranith is a bit to deal with initially and is rude but gets somewhat nicer as she gets to know you better.
  
- When consuming an Artifact Essence and you change your mind and back out of the menu, another Essence will be added to your inventory (since you've already consumed the intial one). Some UI mods will show this as more prominently adding Essence to your inventory.
  
- Most of the content like the quests and artifacts is centered around Amaniri. She is considered the main follower and though Neranith is feature-rich, she is more of a side follower.
  
  
*\*\* All NPCs represented in this mod use Digitally Generated Unique Voices that are not based on voice actor performances. \*\**
  
  
**PERMISSIONS:**
  
- You are allowed to create any mod that expands on her or adds new features, as long as requires this mod as part of the master files list.
  
- You are allowed to use the custom voice to create voice lines for specific Amaniri and Neranith interactions with other followers.
  
- You are allowed to create appearance changers and similar as long as it is a patch and the original mod is required.
  
- You may not create forked/altered versions of this mod or it's esp in any form.
  
  
  
**HOW TO START:**
  
- Currently Amaniri can be found in Windhelm, either wandering the city or in the Corner Club. Once you enter the city, if you don't find her, she'll find you.
  
  
  
**INTERACTION & PERSONALITY:**
  
Amaniri is steadfast, honorable and clings to her faith in the Tribunal. She is always respectful and helpful to the player.
  
Neranith is snobbish, disinterested and occasionally rude. She initially will only tag along if you offer her gold. She becomes more likeable over time.
  
  
Both gals can comment when seeing an impressive view, being near a dungeon location or when there's danger present. They can also comment generally, in cities, in the wilds, in inns, in certain kinds of weather and in dungeons. If you give them armor to use or wigs to wear they can comment about it. They will also comment about how they feel about you as their relationship improves. They will also comment if you are sick or unclothed. They have many combat lines, hellos, goodbyes and an assortment of follower-based lines.
  
  
They can comment if the player picks up loose items such as healing potions, oddities, skooma, liquor, food, gemstones, crafting items, enchanted items, things of value and gold. They can comment when you loot bodies and boss chests.
  
  
Both can congratulate you when you level up.
  
  
If both are with you at the same time, they can interact with each other. There are around 16 banter sessions consisting of 4 lines (back and forth).
  
  
You can use the Talk menu (Can we talk a moment? (Features)) to get some background information here and there and to change Amaniri's Devotion or Neranith's Attunement.
  
  
  
**INTEGRATION:**
  
Both gals have voice integration for lines if you're using Nether's Follower Framework.
  
The mod was not originally created with Ghosts of the Tribunal (creation) in mind but Amaniri will make some comments and be reverent in sacred areas from the mod.
  
No integrations are a hard requirement.
  
  
  
**RELATIONSHIP:**
  
Amaniri and Neranith have a growing relationship with the player based on a mod-added faction. It starts at rank 0 (Aquaintance) and goes to rank 3 (Enamored). Increasing relationship with them is based on a 700 point system. At 175 points, they become friendly (rank 1). At 350, they become allies (rank 2), with 700 awarding them rank 3.
  
  
Spending time with them increases relationship points gradually, as well as fighting alongside them (awarded once per hour). Once per day you can give them a gift by talking to them, which awards points based on its value (up to 40 points for 2000 gold worth of gifts). You can also compliment them once per day, choosing from 1 of 4 styles (their skill, their competence, their beauty or that you enjoy their company) - they respond according to their personalities and current relationship with you. If complimenting them and at rank 2 or higher, they can talk about something more with you in the future and if you reciprocate it, they will tend to say more flirty comments towards you.
  
  
At any time, under the Talk menu (Can we talk a moment? (Features)), you can ask them about your relationship and get an idea of where you stand.
  
  
  
**RELATIONSHIP FEATURES:**
  
At Rank 1 or higher, Amaniri can heal your wounds and sickness (disease) once per 8 hours (in-game).
  
  
At Rank 1 or higher, Amaniri can train you in Two-Handed. Neranith can train you in Destruction. This is accessed from the Talk menu.
  
  
At Rank 3, you can marry either or them. This uses Skyrim's wedding system and supports CC homes and children.
  
  
  
**OTHER FEATURES:**
  
These settings can be found under options when talking to either Amaniri or Neranith.
  
  
Wear Things in Inventory: You can swap out their outfits to a blank (nude) state, allowing them to wear whats in their inventory. A process checks what they currently have equipped and re-enforces it when necessary and if they are not currently with you and you enter their cell space.
  
  
Open Your Wig Box: If you use a wigs mod, you can place wigs in this box (chest) and it allows them to periodically select a random wig from the box. You could also put an accessory, such as a bow or jewelery in the box if you'd like.
  
  
Turn on or off Companion Mode: This allows both followers to act independently outside of the vanilla or any other follower framework. Turning it on also provides options to turn on or off sandboxing or catch-up teleport.
  
  
Change Comment Frequency: You can increase or turn off idle comments using this option.
  
  
Turn on or off Looting Comments: This option allows you to turn off comments when you loot a body, chest or loose item.
  
  
  
**ABILITIES, AMANIRI:**
  
Baseline, Vanilla: Sweep, Devastating Blow, LightFoot, Alchemy and Skill Boosts.
  
Baseline, New: Custom Fit: 30% Bonus to worn light or heavy armor.
  
  
Devotions: Amaniri can choose 1 of 3 Devotions that grant her special abilities based on one of the God-Kings of the Tribunal. You can ask her to change to a Devotion any time outside of combat. Special Devotion Abilities require acquiring a Daedric Artifact.

**ARTIFACTS:**
  
Artifacts are found during Amaniri's intro quest and can also be acquired later through quest notes randomly found on some enemies.
  
  
All artifacts can be upgraded from Rank 1 (initial) to Rank 5 via the use of Artifact Essence, which can be looted from bosses, capable mages and dangerous enemies (5 levels or higher than the player). It takes increasingly more Essence to reach each rank. It requires 1 to get to rank 2, 2 more to get to rank 3, 3 to get to rank 4 and 4 to get to rank 5. This is a total of 10 essence to fully upgrade 1 artifact.
  
  
Essences have a small chance to drop from valid enemies and this chance is increased for each failed roll. There is a small cooldown between rolls to be resource friendly.
  
  
Artifact Essences act as consumables (potions/food) and you use one to open up a special menu once you exit your inventory. From this menu, any Artifacts that are in your or Amaniri's inventory will show up in this menu and you can spend from 1 to 10 essences at once on any Artifact, as long as you have enough of them in your own inventory.
  
  
Note: In order to handle Essence use in a problem free way, once you consume an essence, all of them are removed from your inventory once you fully exit it and the upgrade menu appears. Have no fear, the proper number of Essences are restored to your inventory after you choose which item to upgrade or you otherwise exit the menu (changing your mind). There is a 0.6 second delay before unspent Essences are returned to you. This solves multiple problems, such as accidentally clicking on multiple Essences or quickly exiting inventory causing a speed issue.
  
  
Each time you increase an Artifact's Rank, if it is a weapon, its charge is upgraded and it will be fully recharged.
  
  
Note: Behind the scenes, each Rank upgrade actually switches out the item in you or Amaniri's inventory for a higher level version. This fixes some issues with attempting an item rank system in Skyrim, such as magic effect tooltips not displaying correctly, or tooltips showing effects that aren't active or enabled. Instead the weapon or item's tooltip is used. Since items are actually swapped, please do not include armor pieces in mods that allow you to create outfits until you get those items to Rank 5. It is also not advised to try to use something like AddItemMenu to try to instantly grab higher ranked items. It will cause things to completely break.
  
  
At Rank 5, each artifact aquires a bonus ability of some kind.

**QUEST CONTENT SUMMARY:**
  
(light spoilers)
  
There is an intro quest where Amaniri seeks the player's help in order to procure some sacred Daedric Artifacts. This spans 3 game dungeons and helps to increase her ability.
  
  
Shortly after, Amaniri asks you to help her reconnect with her sister, Neranith. This leads to you helping Neranith with her own goal and making her an optional hireling by the end.
  
  
While spending time with Amaniri, there are occasional attacks by a group called the Reclaimers, that seek to recover Artifacts throughout Tamriel for their own, to increase their power or to destroy them. After a few of these attacks, you are able to track down the attacks to their source and reduce their impact.
  
  
There are also some drop-quests from notes that lead to a few new Artifacts. You may encounter Reclaimers looking for those themselves.
