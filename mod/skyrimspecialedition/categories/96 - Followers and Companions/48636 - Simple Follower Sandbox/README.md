**Description:**
  
Very small mod editing the DialogueFollower quest to automatically give followers a sandboxing package so that they behave similar to Serana and interact with the world around them instead of always being at attention.
  
  
**Features:**
  
- ESP file flagged as ESL
  
- Lightweight
  
- Carries forward the USSEP fixes but does not require it as a master
  
- Plug and Play. Requires no additional setting up or mods
  
  
**Known Issues:**- Sometimes follower will get preoccupied by something and won't notice you've run off. They'll catch up eventually.
