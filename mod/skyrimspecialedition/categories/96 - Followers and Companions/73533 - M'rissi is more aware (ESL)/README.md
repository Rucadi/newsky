[font=Arial][font=Arial]TLDR: M'rissi will deliver more lines and respond more intelligently to a greater variety of stuff in a coherent way. Try it if you like M'rissi.[/font]
  
  

------------

  
This mod is essentially a light dialog overhaul for M'rissi, with an emphasis in making her M'rissi much more aware and "smart" in terms of how she uses her dialog pool -- and as a result she will be more responsive. As of the current version, it only repurposes existing lines, there are no new records added.
  
  
She will mention and be aware of many other various creatures, places and some events in Skyrim that weren't accounted for originally, such as race variants. Here's a **condensed**, **NON-EXHAUSTIVE** list of changes:
  
  
[/font][font=Arial]**1. Creature/Race/Combat awareness**[/font][font=Arial]
  
  
[/font]

  
* [font=Arial]Every **Dwemer** construct, including The Forgemaster.[/font]
[font=Arial]Every vanilla **summon**, including **thralls**, and their potent versions. Also any **undead** summon or **reanimated** body, which will include also **mod-added** undead summons, as long as they are tagged correctly.  This even includes **Sovngarde heroes**, for example.[/font]
  
* [font=Arial][size=3]All **undead**, including special cases such as Dragon Priests in Solstheim.[/size][/font]
[font=Arial]Every type of **Skeever**, including Venomfang Skeevers will be acknowledged.[/font]
  
* [font=Arial][size=3]Other variants of animals, like the **Forgotten Vale versions** of deer and sabre cats.[/size][/font]
[font=Arial][size=3][size=3]All **dogs**, including **vampire dogs** and **Dawnguard** dogs. Her distaste for dogs will shine here.[/size][/size][/font]
  
* [font=Arial]Will react to **Durnehviir** being summoned, and much like **Odahviing**, she may become excited a dragon is on her side.[/font]
[font=Arial]Deeper awareness of **vampires**, including vampires that don't belong to a vampire race, vampire lords, and the fact that the player is the vampire version of a race (no longer will she forget that a Nord Vampire is a Nord -- common problem in followers). Vampire Lord players will get more lines as well.[/font]
  
* [font=Arial][size=3]**Werewolves** and **werebears**, as well as places that may involve lycanthropy. [/size][/font]
[font=Arial][size=3][size=3]Various fauna in **Solstheim** such as **boars** will be acknowledged in combat, as well as **Hermaeus Mora's monstrosities**.[/size][/size][/font]
  
* [font=Arial][size=3][size=3]When fighting NPCs, she will be aware of their race, regardless of whether they are infected with vampirism or not. A argonian is an argonian, regardless of vampiric status.[/size][/size][/font]
[font=Arial][size=3][size=3]Other combat lines will be a bit more intelligent. For example, after the enlightenment provided by this mod, when she screams "**cut the tail off**", *she will take other into account other creatures that were blessed by Kynareth with a tail*.[/size][/size][/font]
  
* [font=Arial][size=3][size=3]And many other cases of creatures and combat lines.[/size][/size][/font]

[font=Arial]
  
[/font][font=Arial]**2. Awareness of magic**
  
  
[/font]

  
* [font=Arial]She'll be aware of magical **cloaks** on the player, or **alteration** spells, the player's knowledge and skill in them (and other spells), as well as knowledge of **shouts**, and will express very candidly how little she trusts it[/font]
[font=Arial]She'll be aware of the player wielding various **destruction** spells[/font]
  
* [font=Arial]There is a higher emphasis on **spell knowledge** as opposed to **skill level**, since that reflects actual knowledge more appropriately for her lines.[/font]
[font=Arial]She will recognize **high-magic areas** very freely, and will very candidly speak about how disgusted or scared she is about it.[/font]
  
* [font=Arial]Skill levels were tweaked so some lines are also heard without being very high level.[/font]

[font=Arial]
  
[/font][font=Arial]**3. Awareness of places**[/font][font=Arial][size=3]
  
  
[/size][/font]

  
* [font=Arial]She will have a bit more awareness of Skyrim's small settlements.[/font]
[font=Arial]She will have more lines of just about every type of place in Skyrim.[/font]
  
* [font=Arial]She will express dislike, like, and fear about many more places than before in a coherent way.[/font]
[font=Arial]She will recognize about any kind of dungeon, with various mechanisms in place to ensure none are missed.[/font]
  
* [font=Arial]She will recognize very scary places, including places with Thalmor activity, and respond appropriately.[/font]
[font=Arial]She will recognize odd places for bandit camps, special dungeons, docks, places with fish, halls of the dead, inns, libraries, places that smell like dogs, places with lots of mushrooms, places that may contain skeevers, places that may contain an evil presence, creepy places where a tragedy might have occurred, and many more with such specific places or situations.[/font]
  
* [font=Arial]She will recognize in some ways Khajiit caravans.[/font]

[font=Arial]
  
[/font][font=Arial]**4. Self-awareness/NPC awareness/Player awareness**[/font][font=Arial][size=3][size=3]
  
  
[/size][/size][/font]

  
* [font=Arial]Deeper awareness of what **armor** she (or the player) is wearing, including what type of armor it is, based on weight, materials, appearance, and variety. She will voice like and dislike for a greater variety of armors, including daedric artifacts.[/font]
[font=Arial]Deeper awareness of what **weapon or tool** she (or the player) is wielding, including what type of weapon it is, based on weight, materials, appearance, and variety.[/font]
  
* [font=Arial]M'rissi will now be able to identify vanilla pre-enchanted armors and weapons, instead of only detecting the base unenchanted items.[/font]
[font=Arial]She will have more lines in response to player health and will respond with more awareness to it. For example, she will correctly identify you as sick with Sanguinare Vampiris.[/font]
  
* [font=Arial]She will more candidly talk about her joy after the resolution of her nightmare quest, and not just in one particular inn in Skyrim.[/font]
[font=Arial]She will recognize more accurately how wet or cold she is.[/font]
  
* [font=Arial]She will recognize in various ways your own stats, such your magicka level, how many potions or ingredients you have consumed, as well as your resistance to the elements.[/font]
[font=Arial]She will complain more often about Heismkr, and in a more "smart" way based on whether she is close to Heimsk or not. I mean, obviously.[/font]
  
* [font=Arial]She will not try to shout around the greybeards unless she knows the Dragonborn is the Dragonborn. No longer will she have glimpses into the future![/font]
[font=Arial]She will respond to players actions more often, such as mining and crafting, instead of to just skill levels of the player, making her comments feel smarter or less random.[/font]
  

[font=Arial]
  
**5. Romance****/Friendship/Quest**[size=3]
  
  
[/size][/font]

  
* [font=Arial]Various lines[/font][font=Arial] that were marriage-only or kinship-only have been unbound, where it makes sense, so they can be heard elsewhere. As well as lines that were bound to non-marriage or non-kinship, only where it made sense.[/font]
[font=Arial]Lines that hinted at attraction no longer happen if already married or in kinship, since that's when it stops making sense.[/font]
  
* [font=Arial]Jealousy lines were expanded significantly so that all housecarls are accounted for, and other followers.[/font]
[font=Arial]A few of the mean comments referring to her dislike of vampires and werewolves will fade if the player is married to her, to signify a higher regard for the player.[/font]
  
* [font=Arial]Some lines were adjusted such that they respond in a more precise way to how well and badly you have treated her so far.[/font]

[font=Arial][size=3]
  
[/size]**6. Skyrim Quest awareness**
  
[size=3][size=3][size=3]
  
M'rissi is not very heavy in quest awareness, much of her dialog revolves around place awareness. However:
  
[/size]
  
[/size][/size][/font]

  
* [font=Arial]She will take into account the status of Vaermina's quest in order to decide whether to comment on nightmares.[/font]
[font=Arial]She will take into account the status of Dragon Rising before commenting on dragon attacks.[/font]
  
* [font=Arial]She will take into account other minor quests to decide whether some lines are allowed or not, such as the spider infestation in Shor's Stone.[/font]
[font=Arial]She will take into account the status of the quest to find Valerica.[/font]
  
* [font=Arial]She will take into account whether the haunted ruins problem in Ivarstead is resolved or not[/font]
[font=Arial]She will properly take into account whether the Hall of the Vigilants is actually destroyed before commenting on the carnage.[/font]
  
* [font=Arial]Some comments on some followers will respond to their quests being completed or not (eg. Kharjo)[/font]

[font=Arial]
  
[/font][font=Arial][size=3][size=4]**7. Misc**[size=3] (a.k.a. I can't think of a better category)
  
  
[/size][/size][/size][/font]

  
* [font=Arial][size=3][size=3]Some lines that were almost impossible to trigger were repurposed for situations where they fits, including a [/size][/size][size=3][size=3]line for werewolves, where she wonders if you'll rule them one day![/size][/size][/font]
[font=Arial][size=3][size=3][size=3]The skill requirements for many lines were tweaked to see them earlier or later, as well as modified so that they respond to actions of the player, such as brewing potions and using an anvil or forge, instead of just having a level of skill in the correspondent ability.[/size][/size][/size][/font]
  
* [font=Arial][size=3][size=3][size=3]Emotion values and nature of many, many lines were tweaked for a more natural flow.[/size][/size][/size][/font]
[font=Arial][size=3][size=3][size=3]Bugged lines that made them impossible to trigger or unlikely were fixed or tweaked.[/size][/size][/size][/font]
  
* [font=Arial][size=3][size=3][size=3]Chains of conditions were for the most part simplified, and irrelevant ones removed, so the engine is less taxed when processing them.[/size][/size][/size][/font]
[font=Arial]A couple of dialog bugs based on player race and gender were also fixed[/font]
  
* [font=Arial][size=3][size=3][size=3]The timing and the chances of many, many lines were tweaked so their frequency is adjusted to a more balanced flow.[/size][/size][/size][/font]
[font=Arial][size=3][size=3][size=3]Some comments were repurposed because they were responding to things in a way that felt quite random or not intentional enough. For example, she has a line complaining about neck aches if you're a vampire ("Her neck aches"). Yeah, vampires bite necks and it almost sounds like there is an underlying assumption that you suck her blood. But don't underestimate the reality of torticolis! [/size][/size][/size][/font]
  

[font=Arial]
  
And other stuff.
  
  
**About compatibility:** It will be compatible with anything that doesn't affect her dialog. There is also a small edit to her exotic armor involved in a quest, so if you're using a mod that modifies those armors, it might require some patching. It is compatible with my other M'rissi mods, although the vampirism fix is irrelevant with this mod, and the other ones should be preferably loaded after this one.
