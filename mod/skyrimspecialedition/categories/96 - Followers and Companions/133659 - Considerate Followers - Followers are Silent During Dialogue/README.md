[font=Times New Roman]Overview[/font][font=Verdana]
  
Considerate Followers is a small mod with a huge impact for those of us who love to travel with companions - it stops followers from speaking while you are in dialogue or you are watching someone else speak. This is done at the engine level, to make absolutely sure that nobody else has the stage. Considerate followers doesn't just stop followers from talking though, it also makes sure that if they have something to say, they will do so when they next have the opportunity, so their brains don't get scrambled.

If you are using a version of Skyrim earlier than 1.6.1130, then you will need to use one fo the ports. Be aware that these aren't maintained by me, and I would ask that you do not report issues here if you are using them.
