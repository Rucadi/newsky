At first Kaidan comes across as taciturn, if not stand-offish. You’ll soon learn that there’s more to this warrior than meets the eye. Become friends with this wandering mercenary and help him unlock the secrets of his heritage, as well as confront the darker parts of his past. With time you may even find romance blossoming between yourself and Kaidan.[/font]

SpoilerCaptured by Thalmor and held in the Abandoned Prison, Kaidan needs your help to escape his tormentors. Free him from his shackles and help him recover his equipment, and you’ll find yourself with a skilled mercenary who owes you his life.
  
  
Once you’ve rescued him, you will quickly learn about why he has come to Skyrim; to unlock the secrets of his past and his heritage. By speaking to him and listening to what he has to say, you’ll find yourself learning more about his childhood and what brought him to Skyrim.
  
  
In Kaidan’s main quest ‘*All of This Past*’, events naturally unfold as the player progresses along the main story line, revealing an intricate mystery that ties Kaidan’s fate to yours.
  
  
In ‘*Blood and Fire*’ an old enemy resurfaces, plunging you and Kaidan deep into the darkest parts of his past, forcing him to confront the worst parts of himself.
  
  
Kaidan can also be more than just a friend; by wearing an amulet of Mara you can trigger a romance with the warrior, and eventually lead to marriage in a naturally progressing, immersive romance plot that develops as you travel through Skyrim.

[font=Trebuchet MS][/font]SpoilerThe Kaidan Workshop is a non-profit, volunteer organization fully funded by the Skyrim modding community at large; as per a poll hosted on our social media pages earlier this year, the following additions will be part of the next major updates moving forward in 2025:
  
  
**The Intro Overhaul Pack** – a pack inspired by [WarTortle](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Wartortle?gameId=1704)﻿’s ‘[Immersive Kaidan Start](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64064)﻿‘. Adds a small side quest to guide the player to find Kaidan in an immersive, lore friendly way.
  
  
**The Reaction Pack** – Have you ever noticed events where you think Kaidan should react but doesn’t? This pack aims to add a variety of new lines to make Kaidan more reactive to his surroundings.
  
  
**The Roleplay Pack** – Skyrim is a huge world with many customization options, and even more player characters; this pack aims to have Kaidan react to player driven roleplay options. Kaidan will be able to comment on where the player is from, what gods they worship, even what their background is – all chosen by you.
  
  
**The Faction Pack** – While Kaidan already has some limited dialogue for the major factions in Skyrim, there are three in particular that need to be bolstered. This dialogue pack is all about fleshing out Kaidan’s commentary regarding The Dark Brotherhood, The Thieves’ Guild, & The Civil War.
  
  
**The Dragonborn Pack** – A full script to the events of the Dragonborn DLC. Take Kaidan with you to Solstheim and have him join you on your quest. He’ll have his own thoughts, and his own comments to make as you explore and uncover the truth about the cult of Miraak.
  
  
**The Dawnguard Pack** – A full script for Kaidan to react to both paths of the Dawnguard DLC. Hear new commentary on your work rebuilding the legendary group of vampire hunters, or on your vampiric ascension to power. When you finally make your way into the Soul Cairn, bring Kaidan along with you… at a cost.
  
  
**The Book Review Pack** – Building upon the book trading system present in the original mod, this pack will add new unique dialogue for each of the books the player can give to Kaidan.
  
  
**Paarthurnax Quest Expansion Compatibility** – An addition that acknowledges if a player uses the ‘[Paarthurnax - Quest Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51711)﻿’ by [Jayserpa](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/jayserpa?gameId=1704)﻿ to keep Paarthurnax alive. It also gives Kaidan more to say on this particular quest.
  
  
**I’m Glad You’re Here Compatibility** – A dedicated set of dialogue to go alongside the popular ‘[I’m Glad You’re Here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41856)﻿‘ mod by [WhiteWolf424242](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/WhiteWolf424242?gameId=1704)﻿.

**Abstract's Kaidan Workshop NPC Overhaul**

![](https://i.imgur.com/hycuxFs.jpeg)

SpoilerA community given NPC overhaul for KRCE. Using a combination of new hair, tattoos, & custom armor mash-up’s, all of the NPC’s new appearances have fully unique and lore friendly looks.
  
Includes a new mask for Kaidan (works on the player character, but there are issues with the Khajiit Female mesh).
  
A standalone file for just the recolored mask is also available.
  
This replacer set is meant to be used with Non-nude and [HIMBO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46311)﻿ body types; there may be body issues if HIMBO isn’t used.
  
[HDT](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57339)﻿ is required for some armors to work properly; Some HDT armors won’t have their physics, but still require HDT to not clip weirdly.
  
**At the current moment, this replacer is not compatible with RSV ([Racial Skin Variance](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81668)﻿).**
  
**Files for both the replacer and the mask are under ‘Optional Files’.﻿**
