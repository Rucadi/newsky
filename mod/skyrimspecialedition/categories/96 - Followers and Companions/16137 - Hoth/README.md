**Lore**

  
Hoth is an old bounty hunting adventurer, and a brutal companion to travel with. You see... Hoth has a unique hobby - he wears his most prized kills. He has collected on some of the highest bounties for monsters and men alike in his days wandering the frigid northlands of Skyrim - and he means to show off his work. Learn about all of his trophies in-game!

**Details**
  
Who is Hoth?
  
- Hoth is a male, Nordic follower who can be recruited in the Morthal Inn to join your travels. He fights in two handed style as well as with a bow.
  
  
What makes Hoth special? 
  
- Hoth is the only companion who generates quests for the player dynamically based on your location in the world. As a bounty hunter, Hoth is always picking up new contracts. Talk to Hoth and he will share his contracts for you to do together! Once you finish a quest given by Hoth, he will always have another to offer(infinite quests). There is always something to do with Hoth around!
  
- Hoth is radiant quest enabled. This means he will offer quests inside locations from other mods dynamically! Explore new mods together.
  
- Hoth is 100% fully custom voiced with high quality voice and sound work.
  
- Hoth has his own fully developed story and character within the game. What would you expect an old grizzled bounty hunter to say? Hoth will not disappoint.
  
- Hoth is perhaps the single most visually customized follower ever made for Skyrim.
  
- Hoth has unique custom armor.
  
- Hoth has unique custom gloves.
  
- Hoth has a unique custom hood.
  
- Hoth has a unique custom weapon.
  
- Hoth has unique custom body war-paint and insignia.
  
- Hoth has unique custom skin textures with decals such as cuts, scratches, scars, and stitches.

**FAQ**

  
Q: Are there any requirements to use this mod?
  
A: Nope. Plug and play.
  
  
Q: Hoth's gear does not appear in his inventory - help?
  
A: His things are not usable by the player. This is not a bug.
  
  
Q: I tried to force Hoth give over his hard earned gear with UFO, Amazing Follower Tweaks, or another follower mod. It didn't work, and now Hoth is naked!
  
A: Attempting to steal Hoth's things will always result in tears.

**Change Log**

3.2:
  
- Corrected all subtitles so that they match what Jase says in the recording
  
- Increased the no-repeat cooldowns to the maximum of 24 in-game hours on all idle and taunt dialogue for less repetition
  
- Modified conditions on some lines to make them correct for what is happening around Hoth
  
- Removed lines that are more appropriate as a greeting (for example: "what are you looking at?" and "Less talking, more blood-spilling") from the idle stack, so they'll only play when engaging Hoth in conversation
  
- Removed the UFO patch from the main file - it is not downloadable as an optional file
  
- Archived the resources into a bsa for tidiness and ease of mod-management
  
  
  
3.1:
  
- [SSE version](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16137) released
  
  
3:
  
- Compatibility changes with other companions and follower frameworks
  
  
2:
  
- Custom voice work
