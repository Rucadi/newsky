**This is some kind of a everlasting WIP project. At least until I get bored by this game ;)**

**Straight from the Heart Quality - more light sources for the ENB users (sorry but only for them). This mod utilizes a new "ENB Particle and Fire Lights" feature. Requires 0.365 binaries or newer.**
  
  
  
  
**Adds a light sources to Moths.** 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
[**Torchbugs for SSE you can also find here -> "ENB Light" by 4109 :)**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22574)
  
  
  
**Installation:**
  
  
**!!! "EnableComplexParticleLights" must be turned on in the Effects section (ENB UI) and "EnableBigRange"in the [COMPLEXPARTICLELIGHTS] section !!!**
  
  
Because I did a tweaks only for a meshes, this mod is compatible with all the texture overhauls, but not with the mods which change the nifs.
  
  
  
  
A special thanks for Mindflux/artem1s, author of a Skyrim Partile Patch, for his help :D
