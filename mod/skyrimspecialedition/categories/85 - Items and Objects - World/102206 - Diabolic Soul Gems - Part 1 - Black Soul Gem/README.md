Let's be honest - the soul gem concept is great, but it is not shown well enough in Skyrim.
  
  
You are capturing the essence of a living being on a gem yet the stones look dull, simple and do not capture the weight of the lore behind it. In my opinion these soul gems should reflect the action of capturing, trapping souls and letting souls out to recharge magical items in a way.
  
  
This project will expand how regular items SHOULD HAVE looked like from the launch, starting with soul gems.
  
Don't worry, all parts of this project will be turned into a single mod when it is complete and it will be linked here. First step is redoing all the soul gems.

This mod changes these:
  
Original mesh of the item
  
Original texture of the item
  
Adds a new normal map
  
  
It does not change collision etc. data.
  
It won't be performance-heavy, it is not 4k - 8k - 16k ......

The original mesh is from Skyrim Special Edition itself, from Bethesda and Zenimax.
  
Collision is the same with the base game, from Skyrim Special Edition itself, from Bethesda and Zenimax.
