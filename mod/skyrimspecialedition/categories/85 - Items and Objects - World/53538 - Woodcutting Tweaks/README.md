**Introduction**
  
  
In the past, I made [a mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68205) that adressing woodchopping blocks to no longer be an infinite supply of firewood.
  
  
In the meantime, I found some better ways to actually adress this. That's where this mod comes in.
  
  
**What does mod does**
  
  
Woodchopping blocks are now crafting stations, which can be used to turn tree logs into firewood.
  
  
Tree logs can be gathered by "harvesting" a tree in the world, while having at least one woodchopping axe in your inventory.
  
  
This will encourage you to actually go out into world, rather than just "generating" an unlimited amount of firewood at a woodchopping block.
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
  
Any mod that makes changes to trees, or woodchopping blocks, will conflict with this mod. For this reason, I've added an optional file called "override patch" which can be used to be loaded near the end of the load order, to make sure this mod wins the conflict.
  
  
I've added a patch for [Skyrim Flora Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2154).
  
  
As far as I know, some of the more popular mods that conflict might include [Campfire](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/667), [Frostfall](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/671), [CCOR (Complete Crafting Overhaul Remastered)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28608) and [CACO (Complete Alchemy and Cooking Overhaul)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19924). There could be others as well though.
  
  
Mods like [Enhanced Dynamic Things](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19521) might need a compatibility/consistency patch.
  
  
**[Campfire](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/667) Patch**
  
  
In the optional files, there's a patch for [Campfire](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/667). This patch always you to craft a portable wood chopping block, using the "Create Item" from campfire. It requires 4 pieces of Firewood and 1 Treelog. You can place it in the world, like other items from Campfire. To use it, you will need to have a Woodcutter's Axe in your inventory.
  
  
[Immersive Interactions - Animated Actions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47670): "harvest ingredients" animation conflicts. Disable its "harvest ingredients" in MCM. 
  
  
If you're having issues still getting firewood automatically, even if the crafting menu has opened, [GiraPomba](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/20507499) has made an OAR patch for that. You can find it in the optional files.
  
  
**FAQ**
  
  
Q: If I activate the woodchopping block, it doesn't open the crafting menu. What can I do?
  
A: Try the override patch in the optional downloads and load it as close to the end of your load order as possible.
  
  
Q: ESPFE?
  
A: Yes.
  
  
Q: Does installing/updating/uninstalling on an existing save work?
  
A: As far as I know, it should. However, it's good practice to keep a backup save prior to doing this, just in case.
  
  
Q: Is this compatible with <insert mod>?
  
A: I don't know by heart. You might need to check yourself.
  
  
Q: Will you make a patch for <insert mod>?
  
A: Only if it's a mod I use myself or plan on using, I have enough time and I actually like the idea. Otherwise, feel free to do it yourself. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: I have a suggestion to improve the mod. Can you do it?
  
A: Maybe, if I have time and I like the idea, I'll consider it.
  
  
Q: Will you port this to <insert platform>?
  
A: No, I myself only support the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If someone else wants to port it, feel free. (see permission) If you decide to port it, you yourself take full responsibility to offer support to said port. I will not provide no support for any ports by third parties.
  
  
Q: I use a ported version of this mod on <insert platform> and I have a problem. Can you help?
  
A: I don't provide any support for third party ports on other platforms than the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If you have issues, you should adress the person that ported it.
  
  
Q: Does this work on Skyrim 1.6+, aka "Anniversary Edition"?
  
A: Yes, it should.
  
  
Q: Why don't your mods use MCMs and instead use this janky console command system to set globals?
  
A: I am not a fan of MCMs. You can set the globals by making a patch in xEdit. I have no plans of changing this. If you want to add an MCM, feel free. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: Why don't you use FOMODs?
  
A: That would require reuploading the entire mod, in question, even if I only make a small change. My internet is limited and reuploading the files each time will take a huge chunk of my monthly volume.
