﻿**﻿**This mod offers a new highly detailed model, 4k textures and 2k normal maps for Skyrim's vanilla roasted cows inside the Hall of Valor in Sovngarde, originally released in low quality models and using textures and normal maps with a very low resolution of 512 x 512, making the roasted cows ugly, dated and blurry (as seen in the comparative images in this description). Due to the poor quality of the models, a detailed re-texture of them was never possible, so I decided not only to bring new textures, but also to make completely new models, adapted to the current Skyrim modding standards.**Furthermore, the aggravating factor on the vanilla roasted cow/ox case was the fact that they simply threw a roasted meat texture over the texture of live vanilla cows, which didn't fit in at all, with endless seams*[/font][font=Times New Roman]*and unexpected results, such as a set of teeth appearing in the chest.*[/font][/left][left][font=Times New Roman]*﻿*![](https://i.imgur.com/XwFuxsS.png)

- High quality new detailed model, 4k textures and 2k normal maps replacer for the vanilla roasted cow/ox, world objects originally with textures with low resolution of 512 x 512 and very lowpoly and problematic models; (NOTE - any mod that uses vanilla roasted cows will also receive this replacer, thus maintaining quality and consistency)
  
  
- The rotating metal structure is part of the same .nif as the cows, so I also improved the textures, originally 3 textures in, respectively, 1024x1024, 256x512 and 512x512, with all now available in 4k, but maintaining the original style. Furthermore, in vanilla it is possible to hear the noise of the chains moving the device, but not the sound of the rest of the machine rotating with two heavy cows tied to it, so I added an extra ambient noise from the rotation of the machine, complementary to the noise of the chains already present in vanilla;
  
  
- The two objects derived from these cows, which can be found on the tables in the Hall of Valor, have also been replaced, namely: Roasted Ox Leg and Roasted Ox Head. Both are lootable but curiously flagged as Misc. items instead of Food. Also their weights and sales values are inconsistent. I updated the weight and value to more appropriate numbers, and initially converted them to food, but then I remembered that many mods use their vanilla entries as Misc, so in order for them to also receive the replacer, I kept them as Misc items.

The mod is not compatible with other mods that modify the textures or model of vanilla hanging roasted cow objects. If you have one installed, or think you might have one, put this mod below it/them in your load order. If you are asked about files overwriting those of other mods, press "Yes to all".
  
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)
