I absolutely adore Obscure's take on the College of Winterhold. I have not found anything that I enjoy nearly as much, and my recent attempt to downsize my load order and try the Vanilla college was met with an extremely prompt u-turn to re-add OCW. While I deeply love the overall design of the college, I found a great deal of the placed armor, miscellaneous items, and weapons to be quite overtuned for characters early in their playthrough. This mod is designed to rein in the loot available for the early game while allowing items to scale better for later on.

**Details:**
  

  
* Replaces almost all placed, static loot with leveled variants that will progress in strength as you level up
This includes armor, potions, scrolls, soul gems, spell tomes, staves, and weapons
  
* The new leveled variants respect the archetype of the replaced loot. For example, a pair of Steel Boots will be replaced with a leveled pair of heavy boots, and a potion of Restore Health will be replaced by a leveled potion of Restore Health
The only items untouched are those that provide specific flavor, such as the Scimitar found within a Redguard NPC's room
  
* Halves the amount of raw gold from Enthir's secret chest, but raises the amount of possible gold if the player has specific perks such as Golden Touch and Prowler's Profit
Replaces Ancano's Elven Dagger of Paralysis with a leveled, enchanted Elven Dagger. I find the guaranteed Paralyze weapon to be too strong early in the game
  
  

  
**Installation:**
  
This mod must be installed before you visit the College of Winterhold. I do not recommend uninstalling this at any time during a playthrough, and will be unable to provide any troubleshooting assistance if you decide to do so.
  
  
**Compatibility:**
  
Make sure to load lighting mods and any mods that directly alter the overall layout of cells after this mod so that their changes take priority. This mod does not alter cell layout or lighting, just placed items, so it will encounter no problems. Patches have been provided for OCW's Immersive College NPCs patch and the Book Covers Skyrim patch.
