Have you ever not wanted to find 50,000 gold worth of Ebony weapons in every Dragur crypt late game? No? Well then don't download this mod. 
  
  
  
  
  
Made because I had almost fixed the late game economy in my set up. But like this was like the last major issue. Now I wont drown in gold late game >:D
  
  
  
Requires the fishing CC since it adds new Nord Hero weapons.
