**CS Soul Fragments to Soul Gems v2.0 SE**

  
=Description=
  
Pick up soul gem fragments, go to any forge, convert each soul fragment to a polished soul fragment, then
  
using the polished soul fragments combine two or more to create the various soul gems used in the game.
  
  
The polished soul gems are only used for creating the soul gems or for selling. They are misc items and
  
can only be created not found. So long as you have at least 1 soul gem fragment and 1 linen wrap in your
  
inventory, you are able to craft a polished soul gem.
  
  
eg..
  
===================================================================
  
***Note: (all recipes used to create polished gems require the player to have at least 1 linen wrap in their inventory; it won't get removed; It's used as a condition which I felt was needed to buff out the stones.)***
  
  
To create polished soul gem fragments from soul fragments:
  
[color=#6aa84f]1 soul fragment + 1 linen wrap = 1 polished soul fragment[/color]
  
  
To create empty gems:
  
2 polished soul fragments[color=#efefef] [/color]= empty petty soul gem
  
3 polished soul [color=#6d9eeb][color=#b6d7a8]fragments [/color][/color]= empty lesser soul gem
  
4 polished soul [color=#6d9eeb][color=#b6d7a8]fragments [/color][/color]= empty common soul gem
  
5 polished soul [color=#6d9eeb][color=#b6d7a8]fragments [/color][/color]= empty greater soul gem
  
6 polished soul [color=#6d9eeb][color=#b6d7a8]fragments [/color][/color]= empty grand soul gem
  
8 polished soul fragments + human heart = empty black soul gem
  
  
To create filled gems:
  
[color=#b6d7a8]2 polished soul fragments [color=#efefef]+ [/color]daedra Heart = [color=#b4a7d6]filled petty soul gem[/color]
  
3 polished soul fragments [color=#efefef]+[/color] daedra Heart = filled lesser soul gem
  
4 polished soul fragments [color=#efefef]+[/color] daedra Heart = filled common soul gem
  
5 polished soul fragments [color=#efefef]+[/color] daedra Heart = filled greater soul gem
  
6 polished soul fragments [color=#efefef]+[/color] daedra Heart = filled grand soul gem
  
8 polished soul fragments [color=#efefef]+[/color] human heart + [color=#e06666]d[/color]aedra heart = filled black soul gem[/color]
  
  
To create polished soul gem fragments from filled gems: (The filled souls give the gems an added durability so they break evenly.)
  
[color=#b4a7d6]1 filled black soul gem [color=#efefef]+[/color] 1 linen wrap = 8 polished soul fragments
  
1 filled grand soul gem [color=#efefef]+[/color] 1 linen wrap = 6 polished soul fragments
  
1 filled greater soul gem [color=#efefef]+ [/color]1 linen wrap = 5 polished soul fragments
  
1 filled common soul gem [color=#efefef]+ [/color]1 linen wrap = 4 polished soul fragments
  
1 filled lesser soul gem [color=#efefef]+[/color] 1 linen wrap = 3 polished soul fragments
  
1 filled petty soul gem [color=#efefef]+[/color] 1 linen wrap = 2 polished soul fragments[/color]
  
  
To create polished soul gem fragments from empty gems: (Empty gems are weaker in durability and lose a piece when smashed apart.)
  
[color=#6d9eeb]1 empty black soul gem + 1 linen wrap = 7 polished soul fragments
  
1 empty grand soul gem + 1 linen wrap = 5 polished soul fragments
  
1 empty greater soul gem + 1 linen wrap = 4 polished soul fragments
  
1 empty common soul gem + 1 linen wrap = 3 polished soul fragments
  
1 empty lesser soul gem + 1 linen wrap = 2 polished soul fragments
  
1 empty petty soul gem + 1 linen wrap = 1 polished soul fragment[/color]
  
  
For optional Arcane Archer Pack patch
  
1 polished soul fragment = 1 soul gem arrowhead
  
  
=======================================================================
  
  
Technical reason for the polished soul gem:
  
Why not just use the soul gem fragments directly and convert to soul gems?
  
Reason is, each different model soul gem fragment you find in the game is considered a separate misc item.
  
The forge only handles one type of item at time (in the creation kit). It won't except this OR that OR that etc.
  
It's either All of this + all of that. So to get around that limitation I needed a uniformed conversion
  
to take all the different item id's of soul gem fragments and turn them into one unit, which I called
  
polished soul gem fragments.
