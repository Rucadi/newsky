**Description**
  
Many dunmers living in Windhelm's Gray Quarter still think about their destroyed homeland. They decided to bring at least some parts of their cultural heritage into their new location of residence and try to make it less foreign. That's why they're filling their houses with furniture shipped from Solstheim or created locally in the style of Vvardenfell's homes.
  
  
Mod uses [Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805) to replace all the Grey Quarter interiors' furniture for their dark elf counterparts, introducing new and retextured models.
