**:Decorating Madness:**
  
  
Adds plants, creatures and clutter from the Saints and Seducers creation club  creation to the Pelagius wing and Pelagius mind.
  
  
The Saints and Seducers Creation adds some new wonderful plants, creatures and statics from Shivering Isles to Skyrim and I thought it would be great to see more of them - but in a lore friendly way.
  
  
Now the precence of the God of Madness is spreading into the world of Skyrim in a lore friendly, immersive way!
