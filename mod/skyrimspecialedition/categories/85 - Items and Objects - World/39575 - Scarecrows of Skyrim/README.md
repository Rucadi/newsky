This mod simply places scarecrows at various locations that have crops.  There are four options:  Hat, helmet, jester, and Eli.
  
  
Hat, helmet, and jester model by [hrodeberht1](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/7150507) and Bella.  See [hrodeberht1](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/7150507)'s profile for the resources.
  
  
Eli model by [Elianora](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3231858), with permission, as seen in [Aldamar - Druid Mushroom Home](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46065).
  
  

  
* I made sure they weren't placed on any markers (the things that make farmers work their farm).
After placing the scarecrows with CK, I reviewed all references in SSEEdit to ensure the plugin was clean and without unexpected edits.
  
* The plugins are ESL flagged ESP files, so they won't take up a slot in your load order.
I let LOOT sort it into my 1200+ plugin load order and reviewed placements to ensure compatibility.
  
* New in 1.5:  Scarecrows in snowy areas now have snow on them!  Simplicity of Snow patch available.  (I did test with BDS 2 and 3, and neither of those seemed to need a patch.)
New in 1.6:  [Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805)﻿ version now up!  Any of the scarecrows can appear at a given location!  A few more details in the sticky.
