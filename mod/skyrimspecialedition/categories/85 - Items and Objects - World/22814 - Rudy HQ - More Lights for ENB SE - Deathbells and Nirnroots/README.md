**Straight from the Heart Quality - more light sources for the ENB users (sorry but only for them). This mod utilizes a new "ENB Particle and Fire Lights" feature. Requires 0.365 binaries or newer.**
  
  
  
**Adds a light sources to the Deathbells and Nirnroots.**

**Installation:**
  
  
**!!! "EnableComplexParticleLights" must be turned on in the Effects section [font=Verdana][b][size=3][color=#cccccc](ENB UI)**[/font] and "EnableBigRange"in the [COMPLEXPARTICLELIGHTS] section !!!

Because I did a tweaks only for a meshes, this mod is compatible with all the texture overhauls, but not with the mods which change the nifs.
