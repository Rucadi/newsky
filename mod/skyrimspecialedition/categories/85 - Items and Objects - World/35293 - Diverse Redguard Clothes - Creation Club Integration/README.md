**Requires Lord's Mail Creation Club Content!**[left]
  
The Lord's Mail Creation Club content adds a few new pieces of Redguard clothing.
  
  
This mod will add that clothing to the Alik'r leveled list so that any NPC that would normally wear the standard Redguard outfit now has a chance to spawn with one of the new outfits![/left]
  
It is randomized what they will spawn with, so you may see an Alik'r wearing nothing new at all. Alik'r that would normally not wear a hood - like Kematu - will still have no hood, but their outfit can still be different.
  
  
**All in all, Alik'r can now wear any of the following:**
  
- Regular Outfit + Regular Hood + Regular Boots
  
- Green Outfit + Green Hood + Dark Boots
  
- Tan Outfit + Yellow Hood + Regular Boots
  
- Dark Outfit + Red Hood + Dark Boots
  
  
As a result of this, Nazir's outfit is no longer exclusive to him. This was a design choice made in the Creation itself, but this mod will distribute it on a wider scale. I've added an optional version that changes Nazir so he wears the standard Dark Brotherhood armor but with the red Redguard hood.
  
  
This mod is flagged as an ESL. This is my first mod, and I have tested it, but please let me know if you have any issues.
  
  
**Special Thanks**A big shout out to [PierreDespereaux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/61720101) for being an inspiration and for figuring out how to have the Alik'r color-coordinate.
  
I'd also like to thank [Symonson](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/83588978) for being an inspiration to me as well.
  
And of course, thank you to Bethesda for Skyrim and the Creation Club content.
