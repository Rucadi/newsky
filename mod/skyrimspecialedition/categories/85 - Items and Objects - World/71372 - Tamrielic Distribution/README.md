When I first started modding I almost exclusively made "integration and distribution" mods. I've branched out since then and made a whole host of different types of content, but I still have a soft spot for making mods feel naturally integrated alongside the base game. Tamrielic Distribution is the natural end to this goal; it is a framework that allows me to easily integrate several conflicting mods together and really get them to mesh together nicely
  
  
This mod comes with a FOMOD that will allow you to select from several different modules. Only select the modules for mods you use, there are no dependencies beyond that.

Tamrielic Distribution has a master ESP that is designed to keep patching to a minimum. Each module is dependent on the master and adds their respective content into the world. Without any modules the only thing the master does is make Dragonborn items sellable by Khajiit caravans, the East Empire Company vendor in Solitude, Brand-Shei in Riften, and the Gray Quarter merchants in Windhelm.

**Recommended Mods**
  
  
There are a handful of mods I recommend you pair with Tamrielic Distribution to further integrate content into your game.
  
  
While this mod has a few modules for Alternative Armor content it doesn't actually add the armors into loot lists. I recommend you use [On a Crimson Trail](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52647) for this. Not only does it cleanly and naturally add all these armors to vanilla loot lists but it also overhauls the quests to feel more natural and interconnected. I provide optional plugins to disable the Alternative Armor quests for all the content not currently covered by Crimson Trail.
  
  
If you use the Crossbow Collection Module it is recommended that you pair it with [Thwack](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42653/). I also recommend you pick up [Kachuck](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71081) to completely integrate Anniversary Edition's crossbows.
  
  
**Superseded Mods**
  
  
Tamrielic Distribution supersedes several of my old mods. I have deleted all these files since I am no longer interested in maintaining their pages. However, if for whatever reason you still want to use these old mods you can find them in the [Miscellaneous Downloads](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71372?tab=files) section of this modpage.
  
  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TateTaylorUSA/TateTaylorUSA/master/assets/images/banners/Compatibility.png)
  
  
This mod edits a handful of actor, leveled list, and container records. It is recommended that you check this mod against your load order via xEdit.
  
  
If you use a module that supersedes a mod, don't use the superseded mod. It will be incompatible and redundant.
  
  
For the best results load [font=Courier New]Tamrielic Distribution.esp[/font] and all its plugins as low in your load order as possible.
