**Backstory**
  
  
During my very first playthrough, I wanted to destroy certain items. When Dawnguard got released I was excited to see the [Aetherium Forge](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Aetherium_Forge). As I had watched the LOTR Trilogy shortly before, I dropped a lot of unwanted items into the lava to "destroy" them.
  
  
Later on, during my 3rd or 4th playthrough, I made a Daedra Hunter that collected Daedric Artifacts until he found a way to destroy them. The [Aetherium Forge](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Aetherium_Forge) proved useful for them. Unfortunately, the items that were dropped in the lava weren't actually destroyed. I remember thinking "Wouldn't it be nice if they actually got destroyed?" I didn't have any modding experience at that time, so I thought nothing more of it.
  
  
Recently, I rewatched the LOTR trilogy, and I remembered the idea I had. But this time, I do have the modding experience to make this work. As such, this mod was born.

**Description**
  
  
When you're at the [Aetherium Forge](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Aetherium_Forge) and drop an item into the lava, it will cause an explosion, after which the item is destroyed (disabled and deleted).
  
  
There are 3 different types:
  
  

  
* Mundane items -> small shock
Magical items (enchanted and unique weapons and armor), as well as Ebony, Glass, Stalhrim and Dragonplate/bone/scale equipment -> Fiery explosion
  
* Artifacts (Daedric weapons and armors and Daedric Artifacts) -> Dark red explosion.

  
I don't know how lore accurate this is. For mundane and magical items, as far as I know they can be destroyed. For Daedric Artifacts, they are probably sent back to Oblivion.
  
  
In addition, if living NPCs fall in the lava, they'll now also take damage.
  
  
If any corpses fall into the lava, they will dissolve after a while. If they have any Daedric artifacts on them when this happens, those will be dropped and destroyed as well.
  
  
Daedric Princes will respond when you destroy their artifact. Thanks to [rotol](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/33032075) for providing the voice lines.
  
  
They will also summon their minions to attack you:

These spawns can be turned off by using a console command. (see Customization)
  
  
The main file comes with 1k textures for the new creatures. But there are options for higher resolution textures in the optional downloads. (2k and 4k+)
  
  
There's support for Black Books. They can also be destroyed. If you do, you'll also lose any relevant boons they gave you, with the exception of the Bend Will Shout. If you had the "Dremora Butler" or "Dremora Merchant" Lesser Power when their book is destroyed, they will appear and you'll have to fight them.

List of boons that will be removed:

Dragonborn Force
  
* Dragonborn Frost

  
  
**Filament and Filigree**

* Secret of Protection

  
  
**The Hidden Twilight**
  

  
* Mora's Agony

**The Changing Course**
  
(This Black Book is added by [Defy the Gardener](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58079).)
  

  
* Gift of the Mage
Gift of the Warrior
  
* Gift of the Thief

  
  
  
You can also drop Pelagius' Hip Bone and Meridia's Beacon in the Aetherium Forge. Doing so results in failing the relevant quests and provoking the same reaction from their Daedric Prince, as you would by destroying their artifact.
  
  
Note: Under normal circumstances, Black Books cannot be dropped. I've added an exclusion for dropping them at the Aetherium Forge. However, once dropped, they cannot be picked back up. Please keep this in mind and do so at your own risk. In addition, I've added a requirement to have completed the quest [At the Summit of Apocrypha](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:At_the_Summit_of_Apocrypha), to avoid any running quests from breaking.
  
  
Pelagius' Hip Bone and Meridia's Beacon could also not be dropped and I have also added exceptions to them. However, they will be able to be picked back up.
  
  
Destroying an Artifact now rewards you with perk points. The amount is dependent on the deity:

**Compatibility**
  
  
Any mods that edit the lava trigger will be incompatible.
  
  
I included formlists to add certain to be considered as magical items or artifacts.
  
  
[Script Optimization and Fixes Compilation](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/105144) has a script that conflicts. (DLC1LD\_LavaTriggerScript) Load my mod after this one, as my mod already contains the same script optimizations + more edits.
  
  
[Ethereal Immunity](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69744): Load my mod after this one. I already incorporated the edits to the DLC1LD\_LavaTriggerScript in my mod.
  
  
These mods have inbuilt compatibility:

* [The Whispering Door - Quest Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76606)﻿ -> In the "good" ending, instead of taking the Ebony Blade to a Vigilant for safekeeping, you can now drop the Ebony Blade in the Aetherium Forge and it will complete the quest.
[Mephala's Curse](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120650)﻿
  
* [ASGO - Andrealphus Soul Gems Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/123348) -> Destroying filled soul gems releases their souls.

**Known Issues**
  
  
Weapons and armor that have been enchanted by the player won't be recognized as such. This seems to be an engine limitation.

**FAQ**
  
  
Q: This mod doesn't work.
  
A: That comment doesn't work either.
  
  
Q: ESPFE?
  
A: Yes.
  
  
Q: Does installing/updating/uninstalling on an existing save work?
  
A: As far as I know, it should. However, it's good practice to keep a backup save prior to doing this, just in case.
  
  
Q: Is this compatible with <insert mod>?
  
A: I don't know by heart. You might need to check yourself.
  
  
Q: Will you make a patch for <insert mod>?
  
A: Only if it's a mod I use myself or plan on using it, I have enough time and I actually like the idea. Otherwise, feel free to do it yourself. (See permissions.)
  
  
Q: I have a suggestion to improve the mod. Can you do it?
  
A: Maybe, if I have time and I like the idea, I'll consider it.
  
  
Q: Will you port this to <insert platform>?
  
A: No, I myself only support the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If someone else wants to port it, feel free. (See permissions.) If you decide to port it, you yourself take full responsibility to offer support to said port. I will not provide any support for any ports by third parties.
  
  
Q: I use a ported version of this mod on <insert platform> and I have a problem. Can you help?
  
A: I don't provide any support for third party ports on other platforms than the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If you have issues, you should address the person that ported it.
