[size=3]Ghosts of the Tribunal is arguably one of the biggest creations released yet. containing multiple item, weapon sets and even new Dunmer furniture but i've always felt this was missed opportunity to further expands Solstheim's line of items
  
  
This simply distributes some of the clothing, amour and static items found in the creation to the population of Solstheim in a manner that makes sense to the npcs standing and economy. and making the common robes well... common.
