# Garbage Loot - Barrels and Sacks

[font=Tahoma]This is a small mod overhauling loot in respawning barrels and sacks (also urns from Dragonborn DLC, not to be confused with burial urns in ancient nordic ruins). The goal was to make Carlotta Valentia's (and any other food merchant's) life easier, as well as make looting barrels more interesting.
  
  
The mod was heavily inspired by Realistic Needs and Diseases and made for a Requiem playthrough. It does not contain any scripts and it does not touch other containers other than these three, nor does it change vanilla leveled lists, vanilla food, cell edits, or anything else.
  
  
  
**New leveled lists**
  
  
In an average barrel you are most likely to find rotten vegetables and some moss or a dead insect. But there is a big variety of items (all vanilla except for spoiled food) that you have a chance to find.
  
  
Food: spoiled bread and vegetables are most common, then go alcoholic drinks and luckily found fresh food; Solstheim raw food, and there is a miserably small chance to find a whole wheel of cheese or an expensive drink (don't count on it).
  
  
Miscellaneous items: coal, clay, cheap kitchenware and soul gem fragments are some of the items you will find often. Things like iron arrows, lockpicks, pelts, glass, clothing rags and parts of broken weapons are a bit harder to find.
  
  
The latter could be made into an appropriate ingot (iron or steel) in a smelter. Parts that look like they are wooden and would not have the material (several handles) would be useless.
  
  
Some say you can find an expensive piece of ore or a gem in a usual looking barrel, but for that you definitely will have to pass through billions of skeever drop... tails first.
  
  
Solstheim urns have mostly local loot, but also a chance for Skyrim's as well (and the other way around, Skyrim barrels might have a Solstheim item). The barrels used on the island are the same as in Skyrim (for example, food barrels in The Retching Netch), so the items there are the same too.
  
  
Non respawning barrels are not affected, since they are usually meant for homes and other lively areas, empty barrels are left alone, since they are empty, any other containers (chests, merchants's supply, burial urns, bandit loot, etc.) are not affected, since they are outside the scope of this mod.
  
  
**Fair warning**
  
  
Do not attempt to eat stale food.
  
  
It is seriously dangerous: it will harm you, destroy your stamina and disease resistance.
  
  
I balanced the food after [Requiem](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19281/) 2.0, so it restores stamina (the same amount as its non-rotten twin).
  
  
Added food uses vanilla models, but it seemed too far-fetched to just use vanilla textures and pretend as if it is rotten, and without food at all Skyrim just feels too sad for me. So I did a bit of color correcting... My knowledge in texture editing is rudimentary, so if you want to make it look better, more realistic and horrifying, that'd be great. For now this is better than nothing, imho.
  
  
**Compatibilty**
  
  
This mod does not edit leveled lists, but it does create new ones and edit containers, adding new leveled lists directly there instead of editing vanilla ones.
  
  
Therefore mods editing these containers (I mean with plugins, remeshes are fine) would need a little patching. Just forward the model of a barrel/sack/urn in SSEEdit, and it should be golden.
  
  
[SMIM](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/659), for example, does not appear to change any edits for containers (I checked the full version), so it would be perfectly compatible.
  
  
[CL's Barrels and Crates](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3898) only changes chests in its plugin, so it is compatible as well.
  
  
Added food has a VendorItemFood keyword (merchants will not sell it, ~~don't worry~~ not by default, but apparently bashed patch can still add 'em to merchants' leveled lists, lol), so needs mods with opportunity to add food in game (like iNeed) should be good. Without – would need a patch.
  
  
Mods adding new worlds, places, etc. would have the same loot, if they utilize the same vanilla containers.
  
  
[Falskaar](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2057/)﻿, for example, uses vanilla barrels, so you'll find garbage there.
  
  
Requiem adds a script to the food barrel, it's easily fixable in SSEEdit.
  
  
[iNeed](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/645/)﻿ should be compatible as is, just register food in-game.
  
  
[Super Simple Needs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3892) is compatible out of the box.
  
  
Mods editing leveled lists will not conflict: Garbage does not edit leveled lists.
  
  
[Scarcity](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8647/) and [You Hunger](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9143/) both seem to be compatible (judging by a quick look in SSEEdit).
  
  
But make sure to put Garbage after [Complete Alchemy Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19924) (it edits barrels' loot too).
  
  
**Patches**
  
  
I made a small patch for Creation Club Survival, should be working just fine, let me know.
