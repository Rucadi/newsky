**A Good Death - Old Orc Overhaul**

**Introduction:**
  
A Good Death - Old Orc Overhaul is a very small mod aimed to improve upon the pre-existing random encounter of the Old Orc. It tries to revamp the existing dialogue with new motivations for this sought out death along with adding in a new unique armour set for the Orc to wear. It also makes some minor stat changes to ensure the Orc is a tougher challenge.
  
  
**Features****:**
  

  
* **New armour set.** The mod uses the incredible [Pig Iron Set](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/126178)﻿ made by the extremely talented [size=2][Pulcharmsolis](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/122433248). This should give the Old Orc a new look and an incentive to actually grant his wish.[/size]

  
* **[size=2][b]Expanded Dialogue.** [/b]The available dialogue for the Orc in the vanilla was lacklustre to say the least and didn't go into the signifigance of this wish. The overhaul seeks to expand this and add in a more religious and cultural reason for the NPC to wish for death. [/size]
**Fully voiced.**The mod features an entirely new voice actor, the incredible [size=2][Alex Cain](https://www.castingcall.club/complete-the-circuit). He did a great job bringing this small but impactful character to life and managed to portray the state the Orc is currently in.[/size]
