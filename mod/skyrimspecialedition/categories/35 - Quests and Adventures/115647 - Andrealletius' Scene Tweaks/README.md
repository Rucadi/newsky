**Description**
  
  
This mod combines several of my scene tweaks into one package. In addition, there are some more exclusive edits to this mod, which weren't released yet.

**Companions Werewolf Bloodritual**
  
  
During the Companions Werewolf Bloodritual Scene, it always bothered me how Skjors cuts Werewolf Aela's arm and the blood just pops into existence.
  
  
[This video](https://youtu.be/2dHnCTGD26Q?t=830) showcases the issue perfectly.
  
  
Looking at the scripts, the font was supposed fill slowly. This tweak implements that properly, with some additional blood stream to make it look less jarring.
  
  
Unfortunately, this still isn't perfect, but I hope you'll like the improvement.
  
  
This is how it looks now:
  
  
  
**No Awkward Laughs**
  
  
During the Dark Brotherhood's introduction scene, where Babette tells the story of how she killed someone, the whole brotherhood bursts out laughing in this terribly forced, awkward and somewhat cringe-worthy way.
  
  
In a similar way, there's another laugh in the cut scene, near the Whiterun stables, where Uthgerd informs Skulvar Sable-Hilt about Cicero. The latter is cut content, however certain mods might restore it. (such as [Cutting Room Floor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/276), but there might be others.) This tweak does not directly require or depend on mods that restore that content, but it does need those mods to have the scene appear.
  
  
As it got old quite fast for me, I decided to just condition out the lines, so they will no longer be used.
  
  
Dark Brotherhood introduction:
  
Spoiler
  

  
* ~~Arnbjorn: "Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!"~~
~~Veezara: "Ha ha ha ha! Again! Again! Do the part where he tries to buy you some candy."~~ 
  
* Babette: "Okay, okay. Wait. Here we go. "Ooh, you are such a pretty little girl. Would the sweetie like a sweetie? Oh yes, how about some chocolate?" Oh yes, please, kind sir. My mama and papa left me all alone, and I'm so very hungry. I know a shortcut to the candy shop. Through this alley. Oh ya, very good. Very good. My it is dark down here. Oh, but you are so beautiful. Such a lovely smile. Your teeth... your teeth! No! Aggghh!!"
Gabriella: "Oh Babette, but you are so wicked."
  
* Nazir: "What about you, Festus? How did that last contract turn out?"
Arnbjorn: "Oh, yes, please, old man. Regale us with your tales of wizardry..."
  
* Festus Krex: "Ah, the young and stupid. Always mocking the experienced and brilliant. My contract went very well, I'll have you know. Tried a new spell. Little something I've been working on in my spare time. Came "this" close to turning that priest inside out. Damned messy."
Gabriella: "And what of your latest, Arnbjorn. Something about a Khajiit? Merchant was it?"
  
* Babette: "Oh, a big doggy chasing a little kitty! How adorable!"
~~Nazir: "Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!"~~
  
* ~~Festus: "Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!"~~
 ~~Veezara: "Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!"~~
  
* Arnbjorn: "I am not adorable, it was not funny, and he wasn't a merchant. He was a Khajiit monk, a master of the Whispering Fang style. But now he's dead... and I have a new loincloth."

  
  
  
Uthgerd and Skulvar:
  
Spoiler
  

  
* Uthgerd: "By Ysmir, it's true. A jester - funny suit and all. Just north, by the Loreius Farm. Fool had a coffin in a cart, with a broken wheel. Like to see him laugh his way out that."
~~Skulvar: "Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!"~~
  
* ~~Uthgerd: "Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!"~~
Skulvar: "Well, sounds like you've had quite the journey, Uthgerd. But you were gone longer than usual. I got to thinking maybe you weren't coming back..."
  
* Uthgerd: "You sound like my ma. Figured I was lying dead in a field somewhere, is that it?".
Skulvar: "Thought did cross my mind, yeah. War brewing, talk of a riot in Helgen, and now jesters? Skyrim's gone mad, girl. You need to be careful out there."
  
* ~~Uthgerd: "Careful, huh? Thanks, Skulvar. I'll remember that. Ha ha ha ha ha ha!"~~

  
  
  
**Thieves Guild Poisoned Mead Scene**
  
  
This scene tweak makes the commander (that tastes the mead in the Thieves' Guild quest, [Dampened Spirits](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dampened_Spirits)) ~~spit out the poisoned mead~~ cough during the scene.
  
  
The commander can either be [Commander Caius](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Commander_Caius) or [Sinmir](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Sinmir), depending on which faction owns Whiterun.
  
  
  
  
**Roggvir's Execution - Restored Dialogue**
  
  
While fixing some bugs with [Roggvir's execution scene](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Roggvir), I noticed a few lines that had invalid conditions. As such, I fixed those and reimplemented them.
  
  
The lines are: (marked in green)
  
  
Svari: "They can't hurt uncle Roggvir. Tell them he didn't do it."
  
Captain Aldis: "Positions."
  
Addvar: "Svari, you need to go home. Go home and stay there until your mother comes."
  
Captain Aldis: "Lock the city gate."
  
Vivienne Onis: "You should tell her that her uncle is scum that betrayed his High King. Best she know now, Addvar."
  
Addvar: "You're all heart, Vivienne."
  
Captain Aldis: "Roggvir. You helped Ulfric Stormcloak escape this city after he murdered High King Torygg. By opening that gate for Ulfric you betrayed the people of Solitude."
  
Beirand: "Traitor!"
  
Sorex Vinius: "He doesn't deserve to speak!"
  
Roggvir: "There was no murder! Ulfric challenged Torygg. He beat the High King in fair combat."
  
Taarie: "Liar!"
  
Roggvir: "Such as our way! Such as the ancient custom of Skyrim, and all Nords!"
  
Jala: "Booooo."'
  
Sorex Vinius: "Booooo."
  
**Vivienne Onis: "Cut em down!"**
  
Taarie: "Booooo."
  
**Captain Aldis: "Guard. Prepare the prisoner."
  
Roggvir: "I don't need your help."
  
Captain Aldis: "Very well, Roggvir. Bow your head."**Roggvir: "On this day... I go to Sovngarde."
  
  
**Farkas Come Out**
  
  
In the first quest of the Companions "[Take Up Arms](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Take_Up_Arms)", at a certain point Skjor will "yell" at Farkas for him to show you your room.
  
However, he does so in a very unfitting way. Me being a nitpicker, I had to change this. As such it has been changed from just "Farkas!" to "Farkas! Come out! We know you're here!"
  
  
**College of Winterhold Non-Novice spells**
  
  
It bothered me that [Savos](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Savos_Aren), [Mirabelle](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Mirabelle_Ervine) and [Ancano](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ancano) use Novice level spells during their scenes involving the Eye of Magnus. Given they're Expert mages, they shouldn't be using spells that are so low level. As such, I changed the following:
  
  

  
* To break the initial ward in the Hall of the Elements, Savos and Mirabelle will cast an unknown spell against it. (instead of Sparks and Frostbite)
Ancano will cast a concentration based Absorb Magicka spell on the Eye. (instead of Sparks)
  

  
  
**The Book of Love - More Hugging**
  
  
In my quest to fix insignificant details, I found something I wanted to adress. When you complete the part of the Book of Love quest, where you help Faleen and Calcelmo find each other, Faleen says to him: "Come here you!" and they then succeed to walk away, which ruins the whole moment.
  
  
That's where my mod comes in: Now they'll actually hug.
  
  
In addition, Fastred will also hug Klimmek or Bassianus.
  
  
**More Epic Destruction of Skull of Corruption**
  
  
At the end of [Waking Nightmare](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Waking_Nightmare) if Erandur destroys the Skull of Corruption, it always felt off, like there's missing something. That's why I've added an explosion when it happens to make it look more "epic".
  
  
**Amaund Motierre Claps**
  
  
In [Volunruud](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Volunruud), when [Amaund Motierre](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Amaund_Motierre) calls [Rexus](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Rexus), he [claps within the dialogue](https://youtu.be/hSFtKhCOHSY?feature=shared&t=1785), but without actually clapping his hands. I have fixed this. In addition, I also fixed certain pathing errors for Rexus, where he was awkwardly walking to the player.
  
  
**Dark Brotherhood Intro Scene at the Dining Hall**
  
  
I have moved the Dark Brotherhood intro scene (where each member of the Brotherhood tells their latest kill) from the main cavern into their dining hall. I've also havok disabled the food at the table and fixed the navmesh to allow the Dark Brotherhood members to properly sit at the table. If you still have issues with havok for the food, I heavily recommend [my other mod that fixes it](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93426).
  
  
**FAQ**
  
  
Q: ESPFE?
  
A: Yes.
  
  
Q: Does installing/updating/uninstalling on an existing save work?
  
A: As far as I know, it should. However, it's good practice to keep a backup save prior to doing this, just in case.
  
  
Q: Is this compatible with <insert mod>?
  
A: I don't know by heart. You might need to check yourself.
  
  
Q: Will you make a patch for <insert mod>?
  
A: Only if it's a mod I use myself or plan on using it, I have enough time and I actually like the idea. Otherwise, feel free to do it yourself. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: I have a suggestion to improve the mod. Can you do it?
  
A: Maybe, if I have time and I like the idea, I'll consider it.
  
  
Q: Will you port this to <insert platform>?
  
A: No, I myself only support the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If someone else wants to port it, feel free. (see permission) If you decide to port it, you yourself take full responsibility to offer support to said port. I will not provide no support for any ports by third parties.
  
  
Q: I use a ported version of this mod on <insert platform> and I have a problem. Can you help?
  
A: I don't provide any support for third party ports on other platforms than the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If you have issues, you should adress the person that ported it.
  
  
Q: Does this work on Skyrim 1.6+, aka "Anniversary Edition"?
  
A: Yes, it should.
  
  
Q: Why don't your mods use MCMs and instead use this janky console command system to set globals?
  
A: I am not a fan of MCMs. You can set the globals by making a patch in xEdit. I have no plans of changing this. If you want to add an MCM, feel free. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: Why don't you use FOMODs?
  
A: That would require reuploading the entire mod, in question, even if I only make a small change. My internet is limited and reuploading the files each time will take a huge chunk of my monthly volume.
