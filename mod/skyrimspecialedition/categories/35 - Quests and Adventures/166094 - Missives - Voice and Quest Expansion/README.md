**﻿﻿[size=6]〜Missives - Voice & Quest Expansion〜[/size]**

  
Missives by IronDusk33 is one of my favorite mods, as it adds a lot of things to do in the early stages of the game, allowing you to roleplay a nobody finding their way in the world of Skyrim. My mod expands on the original mod with two separate distinct features:
  
  
**- Quest Expansion:** Expands the number of possible quests you can get from missive boards with 20 new missive types. The new quests are mostly focused on making you interact with the world and its mechanics, as opposed to collecting wolf pelts and the like. There's a bit of everything though, but I think the new quests let the dynamic and immersive parts of Skyrim shine through.
  
  
**- Voice Expansion:** The original mod had the same generic responses used across hundreds of quests. I've added some extra variety through the magic of splicing.

These new quests might appear as missives on the missive boards as usual:
  
  
**Find Book**
  

  
* Find Common Book for Citizen
﻿Find Uncommon Book for Citizen
  
* ﻿Find Rare book for Citizen

  
SpoilerThere's a pre-made list of characters that enjoy reading, as not everyone fits this category in Skyrim. The avid reader will write a missive requesting a book they want to read. There are no quest markers as it's not a specific volume, you just have to keep your eyes open for that book. This quest encourages the player to pay attention to their surroundings and possibly to use their smarts to find the specific book. You can check local libraries, check bookshelves, etc. Books are chosen randomly from the total list of books of the game, including modded volumes if they have been added to the right lists, which can end up making some fun fun story-telling, like... Nazeem might ask for The Lusty Argonian Maid for example... for a friend, of course. ﻿
  
  
**Find Spell Tome**

  
* Find Apprentice Spell Tome for Mage
﻿Find Adept Spell Tome for Mage
  
* Find Expert Spell Tome for Mage

  
Spoiler﻿Similar to the book quest above, but this time for spell tomes. Again, the player will have to use their smarts to find the spell tome in the world. The mage actor is selected based on combat class, so you won't have your average Nord asking for a spell tome.﻿ ﻿
  
  
**Find or Craft Item**

  
* Find or craft Common Accessory for Citizen
Find or craft Rare Accessory for Citizen
  

  
SpoilerThese quests are mostly aimed at crafters. An NPC might be looking for a golden ring with an amethyst on it, you can try to find one out there, but you're probably better off crafting it yourself. By default, circlets, rings and necklaces (of different value/rarity) can be chosen by the radiant system, but it's easy to make a patch to include other items such as scarves, cloaks or any modded "fashion victim" items you fancy. Just add them to the leveled list and you're good. ﻿
  
  
**Miscellaneous Item Search**
  

  
* Catch Fish for Citizen
Find Toy for Child
  
* Find Item From Solstheim
Find Ancient Rarity for Collector
  

  
SpoilerDifferent quests to have you keep an eye out for different types of items, or have you interact with the fishing system. The kid quest is a fun one, especially with the fun spliced lines. There's a kid out there who's saved some money and they REALLY REALLY want one specific toy, the parents wont help goddamn it and it's not in the local store, so they've written a missive about it. Santa time. The dunmer quest is basically a dark elf in Skyrim asking for a food item usually only available in Solstheim (for they miss their home greatly...) and you can help them with that craving. Lastly, you can help a rarity collector complete their collection. They might be looking for a dwemer spoon, a dwemer cog, etc and they're willing to pay a small sum for one of those.
  
  
**Craft or Gather Multiple Items**
  

  
* Collect Firewood for the Inn
Collect Nord Mead for the Inn
  
* Collect Steel Swords for Guard Captain

  
Spoiler﻿Similar to the quests that have you look for specific items, but now you have to collect several of them. Winter is coming and the inn needs some extra firewood, there's an upcoming celebration and the inn needs some extra mead bottles in case they run short, and lastly, guard captain could use a number of steel swords for the city guard, perfect for a young blacksmith to prove themselves.
  
  
**Kill The Thing**

  
* Kill the Draugr
Kill the Pests
  

  
SpoilerDraugr quest is pretty straight-forward. Go to a dungeon infested with Draugr, and put the undead to rest. Pest quest is a fun one. The crops of a local farm are being invaded by a plague of skeevers. Go there, kill all the skeevers. Citizens and guards will run in terror at the sight of the hideous creatures.
  
  
**Find Missing Animal**

  
* ﻿﻿Find The Missing Dog
﻿Find The Missing Goat
  

  
Spoiler﻿Some of my favorite new quests. A farmer has lost her dog or goat. The quest will give you a clue as to where they might be, but there are no quest markers until you are very close to the animal, so you will have to use your detective pikachu skills to find the animal and return it to its owner. Alternatively, you can use Clairvoyance to be taken straight to the animal... Finally the spell has a proper use!
  
  
**Other Quests**

  
* ﻿Heal the Sick

  
Spoiler﻿A citizen has a bad case of the rattles. Get a cure disease potion for them, or hit them with a spell that cures their disease to get a reward. You can finally put your alchemy skills to the benefit of the community, yay.

VOICE EXPANSION﻿﻿〜
  
[/size][/font]
  
You will notice more voiced variety when handing in missives, thanks to these features:
  

  
* **SPLICED AUDIO**: I've spliced like 100 new lines to use as more interesting responses to handing in a quest from Missives.
**MORE PERSONALITY**: This will give the NPCs more personality, as some will be like "Oh, you found it? Thank you! Here, this is for you", "Would you look at that? Thank you!", "Ah, there it is! Finally..." instead of just the basic and repetitive "Thank you, here this is for you."
  
* **MORE VARIETY**: This will also give some much needed variety to hearing the same lines over and over again when doing a lot of missives back to back.
**MOSTLY IN WHITERUN** (*For Now*): The new reactions for the original missives are implemented mainly in Whiterun (and a few other holds). The rest of the responses will use the missives default responses. Why: The way the quests are divided in the original Missives makes editing anything in the mod a pain in the posterior. So the new responses can still be heard in the 20 new quests (detailed above) and in some of the original missives, but not in all as it takes too damn long to implement this. If someone wants to do it, they're welcome to do it following the examples I've set up. All the responses are already "SharedInfos", so you don't have to mess with audio files.
