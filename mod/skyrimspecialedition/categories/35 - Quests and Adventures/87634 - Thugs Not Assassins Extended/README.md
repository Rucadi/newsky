If you've ever murdered someone in Skyrim, chances are you're familiar with the thugs who occasionally get hired to track you down and kill you. You probably deserve it, but it never made much sense that regular mercenaries are conducting assassinations. The way this event works, you are forced to either kill the thugs, or run away far enough that they disappear. Doing either of these things can be difficult, but you just can't continue playing your game until you do.
  
  
Well, what if the thugs didn't outright kill you? What if there were more options to play around it as a character with a stealth-focused build? That's where this mod comes in. Now you have more opportunities to use your persuasion, sneak, or illusion skills to get out of these hairy situations.
  
  
**In a nutshell**
  

  
* You can now have a conversation with the thug leader before fighting.
The conversation includes options to fight, surrender, bribe, or persuade the thugs. Or you can just run away.
  
* If you escape the fight by hiding from them or calming them, they will leave you alone.

  
Some of you may have noticed the similarities between this mod and [Thugs Not Assassins](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34028)﻿ by [Parapets](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/39501725?tab=user+files)﻿. I made this mod from scratch as I didn't know Parapets' mod existed. **Actually, our mods don't conflict at all**. I recommend downloading both mods. There are two world encounters involving hired thugs: [Skyrim:Hired Thug - UESPWiki](https://pt.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Hired_Thug). My mod covers the quest "[Revenge, Hired Thugs](https://pt.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Revenge,_Hired_Thugs)". Parapet's mod covers the quest "[Steal, Thugs hunt player](https://pt.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Steal,_Thugs_hunt_player)". Both quests are hidden to the player as they are considered World Interactions.
