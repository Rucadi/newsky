Numidium logged in Skyrim. Where were you when the Dragon broke ... again?
  
  
[DAC0DA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/134405)﻿ is Vicn's 4th quest mod for Skyrim, and ironically the first in the series that includes [VIGILANT](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11849)﻿, [GLENMORIL](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32998)﻿ and [UNSLAAD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11789)﻿ (in this intended order). Yes, it's a prequel. It sets up everything that comes after it, while also providing some explanations on all the esoteric stuff going on. And yes, it's content complete with a beginning and the end (and everything in-between).
  
  
This is the English translation of the mod - a bit better than the provided machine translation, I hope.
  
  
You know the drill by this point, I think. Tell me if you find any blunders or if you have any suggestions to improve on this. And enjoy. :)

  
  
  

**Changelog:**
  
  
Spoiler
  
**UPDATE 6.12.2024:** Initial release.

**Q: Do you have permission for this?**
  
A: Vicn gave his permission to anyone to translate his mods, so yes, I do.
  
  
**Q: So, what is actually translated?**
  
A: ... Everything there is in the mod at the moment. Really. That includes books.
  
  
**Q: I found a mistake in translation.**
  
A: Great, tell me where and your suggestion on how to fix it and I'll gladly correct it for the next update.
  
  
**Q: Is what's translated until now the final translated version?**
  
A: Unlikely. Depending on how badly I screwed up with the first version of translation, any potential new content coming with the updates of the core mod and also my understanding of mod specific lore (and potential shout-outs to other works), things may change.
  
  
**Q: DAC0DA just updated. Can I still use your translation?**
  
A: NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT. My translation is a replacer of the original DAc0da.esm, and if you use my .esm with the updated .bsa, you will have problems. At best, you will simply be missing all the new content added with the update. And at worst, you'll get CTDs and corrupted save files. Wait for me to update the translation - I WILL update it, even if it may take some time (depending on how much there is to translate).
  
  
**Q: Voice acting, pleeeease!**
  
A: When the entire series is finished, and not a moment sooner. Have patience.
