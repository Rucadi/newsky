I've always found Laid to Rest to be one of the stand-out quests in Skyrim.  As a fan of detective stories, I wanted to try to flesh it out by adding a few more investigative beats to the sequence, to make Hroggar and Thonnir more involved in the quest, and the player more involved in their stories. I also wanted to tackle some layout, technical, and pacing topics which I felt could make a good quest even better.

A detailed spoiler-heavy changelist is [featured in the articles section](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/1367). Here are the spoiler-light highlights.Spoiler▪ A simple narrative-only investigation has been added to the burnt house, including the ability to confront Hroggar about your findings.
  
▪ There is a new road to the graveyard, visible from the burnt house and Highmoon Hall.
  
▪ The pace of the questline has been changed and expanded to involve more player participation. Certain turns in the story require investigation, rather than happening automatically.
  
▪ Various narrative scenes and dialogues have been redesigned. NPCs have more to say and you have more you can say to them, based on what you have or haven't learned.

Please create a **manual save** before installing this mod. You'll need it if you wish to uninstall. The packaged installer will walk you through your options and help you select the needed patches.  Mod Organizer 2 or Vortex is recommended. All plugins use the ESP-FE format.
  
  
**When to install:** To get the most out of this mod, it is best to install it before you've visited Morthal. The quest "Laid to Rest" is invisibly active even if it has not yet appeared in your journal. If you have been to Morthal, open the console with the ~ key and type *getstage ms14*. If the value it returns is 1, 10, or 20, then you're good to go! If it's at stage 30 or higher, you may see some bugs and inconsistencies in the setup. The farther you are into the quest when you install it, the more buggy it will be.
  
  
**When to uninstall:** As this mod deals with quest scripts with assigned properties which begin to run as soon as you launch the game, uninstallation will have unpredictable results. It creates new permanent references which will stay in your save game even after the mod is uninstalled. For best results, if you change your mind, revert to the manual save before you installed it.

▪ Making this mod wouldn't have been feasible without [Creation Kit Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20061).
  
▪ In addition to its global invaluable functionality, [SSEEdit](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/164)'s ability to spot errors in record edits ensured that this mod could actually be released.
  
▪ [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org) with [Papyrus Integration](https://www.creationkit.com/index.php?title=Notepad%2B%2B_Setup) is my preferred way to script.
  
▪ I would not want to mod without [Mod Organizer 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194)'s virtual file system to keep my workspace organized, and backup/restore features to let me experiment wildly.
  
▪ [AgentRansack](https://www.mythicsoft.com/agentransack/) helped me find where any property, variable, or function was referenced anywhere in the vanilla or USSEP scripts in seconds.
  
▪ [Baretail](https://www.baremetalsoft.com/baretail/) allows for real-time papyrus logging for "trace" comments, so you can quickly test and debug your scripts.
  
▪ The [Voice Reference Tool](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18819) makes it possible to find any spoken word or phrase anywhere in Skyrim instantly, and then export the line in various formats.
  
▪ I use [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org) to edit existing dialogue lines into new ones.
  
▪ [Yakitori Audio Converter](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17765) gets the new lines ready to use after they've been edited and lip files generated.
  
▪ The videos were edited using [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/).
