~The Gift of Saturalia~

  
Let me get this out of the way:
  
  
> ***﻿Does this require the Saturalia CC mod?***No. This is standalone, but if you have it, I make use of it. Fully optional however.

  
Ah, the holidays are here. I hope you are all having a great time, visiting family, being surrounded by your loved ones and of course, using the free time to play Skyrim... one more year. ~~If the updates allow it.~~
  
*The Gift of Saturalia* adds a brand new quest in which a bearded old trader will teach you about Saturalia and ask your aid to make his Saturalia wishes come true: He wants you to help the people in Skyrim that are going through a rough time and by doing this, also spread the spirit of Saturalia across the province. Quest is short and sweet, similar in scope to the vanilla quest "The Book of Love", but longer. The best part of this mod I'd say is that it has lasting effects, scenes and dialogue after its completion, altering some locations and the life of several NPCs.
  
  
Features:
  

  
* Fully voiced, with a mix of new characters (with new VA) and spliced vanilla lines.
Expands the stories of several vanilla NPCs that don't usually get much love.
  
* Around 500 lines of dialogue. Quest duration is overall short, but it will take you all over Skyrim. Roughly 1 or 2 hours of playtime.
Lore friendly and feasible: My goal is to make content that feels like it could've been in the vanilla game from the start.
  
* Dynamic changes: The attitudes, routines, relationships and basically the life of several NPCs will be altered by the end of the quest. Some of the NPCs involved might live in a new home or even a new city. All with voiced reactions, custom scenes and quest-awareness.
Persuasion options take into account your "history" with the characters you're talking to as part of the quest. Meaning, if you've helped them in the past (or wronged them), the persuation attempt is more or less likely to succeed.
  
* Quest is very speech-centric and suitable for all ages. A literal quest for the holidays.
If you own the Anniversary Edition Upgrade (including the Saturalia official addon), this mod will improve on the CC Saturalia NPC by giving him a new voice and appropiate lines (He will talk about his reindeer, trying to sell it to you, etc.)
  
* Interesting rewards that encourage staying in the cold areas of Skyrim.

  
Requirements:
  

  
* None

  
Compatibility:
  

  
* Minimal edits. Should be compatible with everything without the need of any patches. (Example: Not a single patch needed in my collection of 1200+ mods)

  
Price:
  

  
* 19.99 Saturalia Cookies

* **LIZZ** as *Diane the Bard.* LIZZ is a talented gamer, singer, artist, streamer and apparently she didn't have enough, so she decided to be a voice actress too! She did an amazing job here and at this point I'm not sure there's anything she cannot excel at. In other words, she's too OP, please nerf LIZZ. Do me a favor and drop by her streams and say thank you on my behalf! You can catch up with her gaming adventures over at [twitch.tv/lizz](https://www.twitch.tv/lizz), where she streams story-driven single player games (with a good dose of singing!)

  

  
* **URGIE**as *Niklas the Trader*. Urgie is a professional voice actor, avid Skyrim fan, avoider of mod descriptions (he will probably never read this) and likes to stream RPGs with his community over at Twitch. He can be a bit silly sometimes, but we must collectively put up with it. He's been my Llama, my Cabbage, my Niklas, my Dremora and also my good friend. You can reach out to Urgie and catch up with his adventures over at [twitch.tv/urgie](https://www.twitch.tv/urgie)

**- ESL flagged? Safe to install mid-game? Does this work on all Skyrim versions?**Yes, it's ESL flagged.
  
Yes, it's safe to install mid-game. 
  
Yes, this works all Skyrim versions. Even Skyrim Microwave Edition.
  
  
**- How do I start the mod?**Talk to the guy camping outside of Dawnstar.
  
  
**- I talk to the guy but he's not responding.**Save and reload the game right there. Skyrim sometimes need a kick in the butt to start quests.
  
  
**- Some of the new quests are rather short.**It's really all ONE new quest, with 5 sub-quests of different lengths as part of it. It's a similar approach to the one I had for "College of Winterhold - Quest Expansion", meaning that the main quest is completing all the college courses, but each course has its own mini quest. I've separated them this way to allow for flexibility on the order of completion + enabling the journals and my fun quest names. If you prefer to have them as MISC quests, you can enable it in the Fomod during installation.
  
  
**- How much action is there in the quest?**Unfortunately for some of you... This quest is pretty much fully dialogue based. It involves talking, persuading and socializing with NPCs, but there is no dungeon crawling, or killing wolves for their pelt or anything like that. It's a longer version of the "Book of Love" quest, really. If that's not your thing, then this might not be for you :(
  
  
**- Is that guy Santa? Does this mod break the 4th wall?**
  
There are winks at the player, but nothing that straight up breaks the 4th wall. For example. Niklas might get cold and sometimes says He is "coming to town". For no reason, you know. In any case, the lore is safe, you can put down your pitchforks. He's no Santa, just an old man with a big white beard. Plenty of those in Skyrim already.
  
  
**- Do I need the CC Saturalia pack?**No, it's optional. If you have it, I improve Bethesda's addon by adding new lines refering to the reindeer, and you get to buy the cool clothes from the guy, etc. BUT if you don't have the CC, then you just get a generic trader with a white beard and the quest continues as normal.
  
  
**- Isn't the secret amulet a bit OP?**No, because to get it you either have a crazy high speech (which means you're already high level) or you literally pay 2000 septims for it... and for the same price, you could already buy an amulet with the same effect without the condition this comes with, so no.
  
  
**- Why are some of the rewards limited to "Cold Regions" only?**Because Saturalia! And also because as a player, I often avoid cold regions because of survival mode, so now there's an incentive to visit these regions.
  
  
**- ...[b]Why the GTA theme?**[/b]
  
You see, I'm a mod *auteur* (lol). As the [artist](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/ff/23/b8/ff23b82e0848e1e74408fdfe903867ba.gif) that I am, I sometimes do things for unknown reasons.
  
  
**- Does this mod use AI? Do you hate AI?**
  
It does not use AI. The NPC lines are reused lines from the game. I don't hate AI. In fact, I always say thank you and please to ChatGPT.
