**It Came from Akavir****[b][size=5][u]Introduction:**[/u][/size][/b]

  
* It Came from Akavir is a short quest mod centred around a mysterious creature known as a Kamal. Within the quest, you'll be hearing all about their homeland, people, and their interactions with Tamriel. This conversation explains and expands on some lesser-known lore about the Kamal, along with featuring a unique opportunity that I won't spoil. Aside from the excellent voice acting within the initial encounter, the mod features a brand new armour set and weapon for the player to wield.

* **Unique idea.**While the quest was a commission, I believe the idea the original person came up with was an incredibly unique and interesting one. The Kamal are rarely mentioned in lore despite how captivating and mysterious their kind are shown to be. With this short mod, it exposes the player to their history and culture while offering new items to further encourage participating in the quest.

  
* **Fully voiced.** This mod has been voiced by two professionals of the industry, [size=2][size=2][size=2][Elizabeth Plant](https://www.elizabethplant.com/resume)[/size][/size] and [size=2][Alex Cain](https://www.castingcall.club/complete-the-circuit). They absolutely killed their respective characters, and I couldn't be happier with the end result.[/size][/size]

  
* **Custom models.**Featuring custom models ported by [Chakra](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/ChakraSSE?gameId=1704), the Kamal and new weapon and armour will create an incredibly unique experience when playing. While not boasting the length of some of my other content, the rewards should leave a lasting impact on your game.
