This mod is a compilation of 5 quest mods that take place in the **Alik'r Desert in The Gray Cowl of Nocturnal** mod by mannyGT. A total of **31 quests** are playable, as well as the addition of **a crime system that adds guards** all around Ben Erai, and in the new cities of Vulstad and Salas Kazas. You will also find new vendors scattered around the villages and a new inn inside Salas Kazas. **All characters are voiced** (apart from the innkeeper who uses a vanilla voice). Inside this mod bundle, you will find:
  

1. **Hammerfell Blades:** Help Duarelm find the Wind Scour Temple, a Blade temple, and start rebuilding the Blades and the Dragonguard archives in Hammerfell. On your way, you will also meet a loremaster and a little girl who might some of the whereabouts of an old Blade agent.
**Desertic Dark Brotherhood:** Reintroduce the Dark Brotherhood in Hammerfell, in the Alik'r Desert, by killing targets and spreading the word that the Dark Brotherhood is back.
  
2. **Cyrodilic Collections in Hammerfell:** Go to the newly opened Cyrodilic Collections in the Alik'r Desert of Hammerfell, a small association that focuses on retrieving stolen argonian heritage.
**More to do in Hammerfell:** Head back to the Alik'r Desert of the Gray Cowl of Nocturnal mod and help the Ash'abah, fight off necromancers and help the citizens of a new village: Salas Kazas.
  
3. **Desert Lamias in Hammerfell:** Join hands with a Lamia in the desert to fight against her sister gone rogue. Recruit her for your next adventures and summon Spectral Lamias in the desert.

  
If you want even more stuff to do in the Alik'r Desert, you can also check out [The Remnants of Hammerfell](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67390) and [Pirates in the Desert](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/132717) as they were not included in the bundle due to their reliance on Creation Club content.
  
  
**Where do I find the questgivers?**
  

* More to do in Hammerfell: Talk to the new people that appeared in town. One quest is in Ben Erai, three in the new village Salas Kazas, one is north-west of the Lantern of the North (talk to the people in front of an unmarked temple), one is in the Retching Netch in Solstheim (but only once you finished the main quest of the Grey Cowl mod after the ending at the Solitude Docks) and the final one can only be completed after you finish the quests with the Ash'abah, the ancient library and the necromancers. The final quest can be started after talking to the Ash'abah Honai, once all the required quests are finished.
Hammerfell Blades: Head to a settlement called Vulstad. On the roof of one of the houses, you will find an old man called Duarelm. Talk to him. Once his quest is done, you can talk to Azita in Azir's Hideout or to the Loremaster that will join the temple.
  
* Desertic Dark Brotherhood: After finishing the quest "Hail Sithis!" from the Dark Brotherhood questline, an "Unknown Initiate" will be on a small island, to the north of the Dawnstar Sanctuary. Talk to her, it will launch the introduction quest. Head to the Alik'r Desert and there will be a map marker showing you where the Alik'r Desert Sanctuary is located. For those who want to defeat the Dark Brotherhood, you just need to have defeated the Dark Brotherhood in Skyrim and go to the Penitus Oculatus Outpost in Ben Erai.
Desert Lamias in Hammerfell: North of the Ancient Alik'r Palace in the Alik'r Desert, you should find two small houses in ruins with a Lamia somewhere in the area. Talk to her and the questline should start.
  
* Cyrodilic Collections in Hammerfell: Head to the northwest of the Ben Erai city, eventually you will find a small house in the desert alongside two towers with the Cyrodilic Collections flag. Enter the building and talk to the argonian lady, she will ask you to work for her.

  
The mod [The Gray Cowl of Nocturnal SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4509), by [mannygt](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3150929) is obviously a requirement. The mod should work fine with [Gray Cowl of Nocturnal Alikr Flora Overhaul SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10141) by sa547 as well as [Camels and new animals in Alik'r Desert (Hammerfell) SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40921/) by gg77. It should also be compatible with "revoicing" mods that alter the original Gray Cowl of Nocturnal mod characters' voices.
