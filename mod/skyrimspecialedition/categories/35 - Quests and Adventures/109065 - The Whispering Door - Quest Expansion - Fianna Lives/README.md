The Whispering Door - Quest Expansion, as is usual for JaySerpa's work, is a great addition to the vanilla quest. I did, however, have one small niggle with it - that being the unavoidable death of Fianna, one of the Dragonsreach maids.
  
  
  
Now, I completely understand somebody had to die for the expansion, and realistically, it makes sense for it to be a vanilla NPC as it is intended to be an expansion of vanilla content. But at the end of the day, it is a mod, and it bothered me having an unavoidable death of a vanilla NPC as a result of a mod.
  
  
  
Ultimately, that's a me problem, but there is a matter of compatibility to consider as well. While I don't personally know of any mods that outright require Fianna to be alive, she is an optional target in a quest for Interesting NPCs, and with how many mods exist, it's always possible that there's other mods that expect her to be around as well.
  
  
  
Regardless of the why, my solution was the addition of Haydja, a third maid for Dragonsreach. The young redshirt lass will work the previously unattended night shift in the palace, waking up and getting to work as Fianna, Gerda, and the rest of the palace go to sleep. When the time comes, she will face her apportioned fate, then fall.
  
  
  
That's about it, really. It's ultimately a simple addition that easily be added in and should be unobtrusive even if you don't plan on doing the quest - Haydja will simply exist and Dragonsreach will be just a little bit cleaner as a result.
