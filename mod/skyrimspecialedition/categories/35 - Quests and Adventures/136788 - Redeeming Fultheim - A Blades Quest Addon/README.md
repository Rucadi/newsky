Mod Overview**
  
[Fultheim](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Fultheim) is an often forgotten about NPC in Skyrim. He is the only non-Blades member in the game to wield one of their swords. In the vanilla game, it's briefly mentioned that he's "drinking away a life of regrets," but that’s all we know about him.
  
  
 I've always felt that the lack of any quests surrounding him was a missed opportunity. So I created this mod to flesh out his backstory and give the player the option to integrate him into the Blades.
  
  
 *This mod contains 90+ new lines of dialogue, voiced through Elevenlabs. Delphine, Esbern, and Fultheim have all received new lines of dialogue.*
  
  
**How to Start - Spoiler Free**
  
A new dialogue option has been added to Fultheim to point out the fact that he has an Akaviri sword. Selecting that dialogue topic will start the new quest, "A Forgotten Blade".
  

  
* The topic will only appear after you progress in the Main Story to the point where the Blades have moved into Sky Haven Temple (i.e. complete the quest "Alduin's Wall").

Within this new quest, you can convince Fultheim, a former Blades member who wants to forget about his past, why he should join back up with the Blades.
  
  
You can appeal to either his sense of **honor**, or his need for **revenge**.
  

  
* The option you choose is significant, affecting the type of person Fultheim will be when he rejoins the Blades.

Both Delphine and Esbern have different opinions on Fultheim. You can ask them about Fultheim before and and after the quest.
  

  
* Their opinion on Fultheim will change based on your decisions in the quest.

  
*You can see some of the gameplay of the mod in the video showcase below: (WARNING SPOILERS)*
  
  
**Compatibility and Installation**
  

  
* Requires [Backported Extended ESL Support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441) if using an older Skyrim version.
This mod is fully safe to install and update midgame.
  
* No vanilla records have been modified so the mod should be compatible with most other mods.
Fully compatible with Requiem as all NPCs make use of vanilla templates. (There isn't any combat in the mod with the added NPC anyways.)
  

  
**Future Plans**
  

  
* Touch up the dialogue if needed. This is the first time I used any sort of AI. Most of the lines sound good to me, but I used those earbuds they give out on Delta flights to listen to them hahaha. If anything is really bad let me know.
Turn Fultheim into a follower after the quest.
