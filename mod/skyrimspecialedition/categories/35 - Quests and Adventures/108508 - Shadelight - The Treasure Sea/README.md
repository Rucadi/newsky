[font=Verdana]Amidst the smoke and noise of a dim tavern, You've heard secretive whispers spoken among the woodsmen...at the base of the Throat of the World, north of Riverwood, the ancient elven complex of Ceyelattamath has been unearthed - by persons unknown. Inside awaits mystery, danger, beauty, and of course...treasure. You approach the haggard traveler and press for more information, his eyes darting sharply out at you from under his worn cowl. He worldlessly produces a small notebook, and hands it to you...examining its fine leather face, you turn it in your hand. Looking up to speak, you find only air where the traveler once stood, suddenly alone in the crowd of the tavern. You open the notebook and find only two things:
  
  
A beautiful painting, and the promise of incredible wealth

[/font][font=Verdana]"What an unbelievably phenomenal mod! It's just one gorgeous cell after another!"
  
  
[/font][font=Verdana]"I absolutely adore it, thank you so much for the insane work you've done! I'd endorse triple if Nexus allowed ?"[/font][font=Verdana]
  
  
"[/font][font=Verdana]Beautiful environments, especially in the second half."
  
  
[/font][font=Verdana]"This mod is fantastic! Definitely one of my favorite dungeons in Skyrim and super underrated, too"[/font][font=Verdana]
  
  
  
This mod at its core is simply about exploring. I really enjoyed walking around mods like Dreamborn Isles, Carved Brink, and Vigilant. I wanted to create an experience that emphasized that feeling - finding a locked door or new zone, and seeing something beautiful and unexpected. If you are looking for a new area to explore every part of, this mod is made for you.
  
  
In Shadelight, the standard formula of venturing inside a ruin to discover its secrets is taken to the extreme - launching the player down a swashbuckling rabbit-hole of forgotten civilizations, foreign lands and alien realms spanning Oblivion. 
  
  
A hybrid of dungeon and new lands, with elements of a scavenger hunt. entirely standalone, and lore friendly. [/font][font=Verdana]![](https://i.ibb.co/TXYWBWP/enb2025-9-3-00-40-30.png<img src=)[/font]

[font=Verdana]LOCATION IN SCREENSHOTS :)[/font]
  
[font=Verdana](a small cave just north of riverwood, along the base of the mountain)[/font]
  
  
REQUIREMENTS:
  
HEARTHFIRE, DAWNGUARD, & DRAGONBORN 
  
IS THIS FOLLOWER FRIENDLY? 
  
YES! 
  
  
WHAT AM I COLLECTING? WHAT ARE THE RULES? WHATS GOING ON HERE?
  
[font=Verdana]FIND THE KEYS TO THE RIGHT DOORS. KEYS CAN BE RIGHT IN THE OPEN, ON AN ENEMY, OR IN A CHEST. KEYS ARE IN GENERALLY CONSPICUOUS PLACES. AS YOU PROGRESS, YOU WILL ENCOUNTER 'GEM DOORS' - BEHIND EACH DOOR YOU WILL FIND A PIECE OF UNIQUE LOOT, IN ITS OWN ROOM/ENVIRONMENT. YOU'LL HAVE TO FIND THE CORRESPONDING GEMS FOR EACH DOOR. DOOR GEMS ARE PLACED MORE DISCREETLY.[/font] IF YOU ENCOUNTER A GEM DOOR, YOU ALREADY HAVE THE MEANS TO OPEN IT. THEY ARE OPTIONAL AND THERE WILL NEVER BE A KEY BEHIND THEM. THERE IS A STORY, DELIVERED IN THE FORM OF JOURNALS, BOOKS AND THE ENVIRONMENT.[font=Verdana] FIGHT ALL KINDS OF ENEMIES, COLLECT ALL KINDS OF LOOT, AND EXPLORE HIGHLY DETAILED, INCREASINGLY EXOTIC NEW AREAS[/font]. 
  
  
  
[font=Verdana]OVER TEN UNIQUE WEAPONS, TWO SHIELDS, SOME UNIQUE MISC LOOT, THERES NEW BOOKS, NEW GEMS (SINGLE INSTANCES), MANY SMALL PLAYER HOUSES, AND A METRIC TON OF VANILLA LOOT. YOU WILL LEAVE THIS MOD RICH AND WITH A FULL INVENTORY, FAIR WARNING.
  
  
HOW MUCH GAMEPLAY TIME/CONTENT IS THIS? IS IT LORE FRIENDLY? 
  
EXPECT A SOLID 5-8 HOURS DEPENDING ON YOUR PLAYSTYLE. IS IT LORE FRIENDLY? YES, BUT: I HAD TO CREATE SOME OF MY OWN LORE, BOTH TO DRIVE CURIOSITY AND TO EXPLAIN THE NEW OBLIVION REALM. IT ATTEMPTS TO BE COMPLETELY CONGRUENT WITH PREEXISTING LORE. OPINIONS WILL NATURALLY VARY. IT DOES NOT USE THE QUEST SYSTEM, SO THERE WILL BE NO IRRITATING ADDITIONS TO YOUR QUEST LOG - THE EXPLORATION IS THE QUEST. I SPECIFICALLY AVOIDED RAILROADING THE PLAYER WITH FORCED ENCOUNTERS OR HAND HOLDING. NOTHING WILL TELL YOU THAT THE QUEST IS 'BEGINNING' - IT BEGINS WHEN YOU WANT IT TO. VENTURE TO THE CAVE IMMEDIATELY, OR ROLEPLAY YOUR OWN PATH THERE. YOUR MOTIVES ARE LEFT TO YOU TO DECIDE.
  
  
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE I SHOULD KNOW?
  
THIS MOD IS AIMED AT MODERATELY POWERFUL CHARACTERS - LOWER LEVELS PRESENT A MORE SURVIVAL ORIENTED EXPERIENCE. ANYONE CAN WANDER IN. TURN YOUR ENB OFF INSIDE THE ORNAMENT SEA AND OTHER PART TWO EXTERIOR AREAS - OR ANYWHERE ELSE IF THINGS LOOK FUNNY. THE AREAS ARE BUILT AROUND VANILLA GRAPHICS, AS I CANT ACCOUNT FOR EVERYONES INDIVIDUAL ENB SETTINGS. THERE IS A WALKTHROUGH IN THE ARTICLES TAB. BRING A TORCH AND AN EMPTY INVENTORY :3[/font][font=Verdana]
  
 [/font][font=Verdana]
  
COMPATIBILITY/PERFORMANCE: [/font]YOU CAN LET THIS MOD OVERWRITE/BE OVERWRITTEN BY ANY OTHER MOD RESOURCES IF PROMPTED DURING ACTIVATION WITHOUT WORRY.[font=Verdana] DOESN'T TOUCH THE VANILLA GAME OR GAME SYSTEMS WHATSOEVER AND SHOULD BE COMPLATIBLE WITH EVERY MOD. OF COURSE, IF YOU HAVE A MOD THAT CHANGES A VANILLA STATUE FOR EXAMPLE, THAT CHANGE MAY ALSO BE PRESENT WITHIN THIS MOD.  PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU RUN ACROSS A PROBLEM - THE ENTRANCE IS ENTIRELY UNOBTRUSIVE, UNOBNOXIOUS AND SHOULDN'T CONFLICT WITH ANY MOD. LET ME KNOW IF SOME OTHER MOD PLACES SOMETHING BY THE ENTRANCE AND ILL MAKE A PATCH. 
  
  
THIS MAY MAKE LOW END MACHINES STRUGGLE, PARTICULARILY PART TWO. THE ORNAMENT SEA IN PARTICULAR IS RATHER DEMANDING - IF YOU ARE ALREADY PUSHING YOUR RIG TO THE MAX, EXPECT MODERATE/HIGH FRAME DROPS THERE. 
  
  
IF YOU LIKE ANY OF THE RESOURCES USED IN THIS MOD PLEASE GO AND TELL THE AUTHOR(S) YOURSELF BY DOWNLOADING AND ENDORSING ALL THEIR LOVELY WORK WHICH THEY HAVE SO GRACEFULLY ALLOWED TO BE USED HERE. IT WOULDNT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE DEDICATION OF THE SKYRIM COMMUNITY :)
