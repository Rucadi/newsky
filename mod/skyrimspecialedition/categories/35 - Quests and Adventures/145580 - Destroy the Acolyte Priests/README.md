Designed as a partner to [Cult of the True Dragonborn - Immersive Miraak Difficulty](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/83458) (but that mod isn't a requirement), and inspired by [Defeat the Dragon Cult](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86625) (which does the same for [Cult of the World Eater](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/83274)), this mod has you searching out the three Acolyte Priests on Solstheim ([Ahzidal](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ahzidal_(creature)), [Dukaan](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dukaan_(creature)), [Zahkriisos](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Zahkriisos_(creature))) in an attempt to defeat them before you fight Miraak.
  
  
Once you have freed the Wind Stone and started [The Path of Knowledge](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Path_of_Knowledge), Storn Crag-Strider will send you a note by courier introducing the three Acolytes and giving rough directions of where they were buried (but not how to get to them). You will need [Better Courier](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40709) (or something else which enables the courier to find you on Solstheim) in order to receive the note without going back to Skyrim.
  
  
If you've already completed the Dragonborn questline, you can still use this mod to track the Acolyte Priests you haven't yet killed - in this case, the note will be sent by Frea.
  
  
Note that this mod will not give a map marker for [Vahlok the Jailor](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Vahlok_the_Jailor); he is mentioned in the note, but since he opposes Miraak (and you will have to complete the Skaal Village quests anyway to be sent to Vahlok's Tomb), it didn't seem appropriate adding a marker for him.
