> "Ah, fishing, my son. After a hard week of farming, or a long night of being nagged by your wife, there is nothing better than going out for a bit of a fish." - *A Guide to Fishing Tamriel* by "The Old Slaughterfish" (The Elder Scrolls Online)

Now that fishing is a thing, **what do we do with all these fish?** That is when the **Dragonborn's Aquarium** shows its full potential. A breton is opening an aquarium near the Cyrodilic border and could use your help. It is up to you to **catch all the different species of fish available in Skyrim** for this aquarium to get to its full potential and open to the public. Are you up for the task?
  
  
This mod **requires the "Fishing" creation from the Creation Club**, as well as the updated version of Skyrim as it uses the Ayleid set that was added in the latest update.
  
  
Do you feel like the Fishing creation fish are not enough for you? No worries! You can add fish from [the Wheels of Lull](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70386) by Trainwiz and DarthVitrial or the [Coelacanth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59493) by BirbWalker21! Stay tuned, more add-ons are on the way!
  
  
What's new in version 2.1.1? The Wheels of Lull Add-on has received an update! Travel with Zirath Malven, thwart the abomination attack and try to get him back to the Clockwork City. He might even become a follower!
  
This new version requires the latest Skyrim Anniversary Edition version, or Backported Extended ESL Support (BEES) to work.

* How do I start the mod?

Head to the south of Froki's shack, enter the Ayleid building and talk to the breton. If he is not in the "aquarium" part of the building, enter the door next to the desk and you will find him in his bedroom.
  
  

* What areas were changed?

A small area near Froki's shack.
  
  

* Is this mod voiced?

Yes, it is!
  
  

* How do I know when I have collected all the fish?

Check your questlog and if everything has been collected, then talk again to the breton and he will put an end to the quest.
  
  

* Does the NPC give tips on where to find the fish?

Absolutely not. But we have the [Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Fishing_(activity)) for that!
  
  

* Who should I talk to to get my hands on a book called "Understanding Grummites"?

Try the general goods merchants in Skyrim towns, or maybe someone in the Ragged Flagon?
