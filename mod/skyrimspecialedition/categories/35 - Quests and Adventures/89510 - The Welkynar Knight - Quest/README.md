[Missing Follower Dialogue Edit](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56115)﻿ - optional: if you want her to be a follower. Don't need this if you have [Relationship Dialogue Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1187).
  
* [Relationship Dialogue Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1187) - optional: if you want her to be a follower, other flavors of RDO will probably also work. Don't need this if you have [Missing Follower Dialogue Edit](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56115)﻿.
You can also force recruit her via a follower management mod if you don't want to install this for the dialog.
  

**Known Possible Issues**
  

  
* If you have broken navmeshes in your Skyrim worldspace, it is possible that NPCs in this mod will get stuck while traveling. There might even be crashes if your skyrim is broken enough. This mod edits no navmeshes, so it is not the cause of your issues.
If you have a mod that **drastically** alters the layout of [the Bannered Mare](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Bannered_Mare) or the ﻿[Thalmor Headquarters](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim_talk:Thalmor_Headquarters), items this mod places might be in illogical positions.

(The answer is "SCUTTLE") Puzzle Explanation: Spoiler"Solitude, the **four**fold city of Skyrim, is a breathtaking sight for all who set their eyes on it. The femi**nine** elegance of the architecture is matched only by the exquisite ar**two**rk that adorns the city's buildings. Yet, for all its grandeur, it's also a place where **one** can feel al**one** in the midst of the bustling crowds and the constant fr**eight** of goods coming and going. Nevertheless, the people of Solitude are known for their **ten**der hospitality, making it a must-visit destination for any adventurer in Tamriel." => four, nine, two, one, one, eight, ten => S, C, U, T, T, L, E.

[/list]**FAQ**
> **Q: My mod manager says this mod has conflicts with another mod regarding "uilib" files.**A: This mod uses [SkyUILib](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57308)﻿ for some UI functionality. Chances are, your other mod uses the same files. If their version of the files are up-to-date, it is fine to have either mod overwrite the other for these files.
