**Unmasking Sybille**

  
The Court Wizard of Solitude, Sybille Stentor, has a secret. It's up to you to investigate her deeds and decide on her fate. Will you keep her secret, demand she stops her activities, report her to the authorities, or end her life?
  
  
Sybille's vampirism is obvious to every Skyrim player, so why is it only acknowledged in small ways by the base game? Well, no more! This mod adds a small unmarked quest to investigate Sybille Stentor and her deeds throughout Solitude. How far you take the investigation is up to you, but remember - proof is key if you want to do things by the book!
