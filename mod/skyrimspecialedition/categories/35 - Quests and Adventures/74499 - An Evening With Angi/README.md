A very short quest where you spend some alone time with your favorite wild archer, Angi. To start the mod, just finish Angi's archer training and talk to her afterwards. If you don't know who Angi is, she's the archer who lives on a mountain near Falkreath and gives you archery lessons. Don't expect a feature length quest mod, this is very short and to the point. If it isn't already clear, this is an adult mod where two adults do adult things to each other in a consensual and adult manor. Oh, and you don't have to do the quest during the evening, but I'd recommend you do it at that time for the mood lighting ;).
  
  
OStim is required, so make sure you download it first.
  
  
While you're here, why not grab my other mod [Fertility Adventures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56750) (and its requirements) to make things a little more interesting? It isn't required, just thought I'd mention it.
  
  
I made this mod months ago, but I never got around to releasing it. I'd be interesting in doing a large scale version of this with other NPCs in the future. If you're interested in that sort of thing, then let me know what you think of this mod, I'm open to feedback. Perhaps you'd also consider joining my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/CHIMinyCricket). Even joining for $1 and leaving the next month would be more than 99% of people would give for free content. Shoutout to Boshilo for being a long time supporter. Whatever you decide to do, I hope you have a good day.
  
  
**Compatibility**The mod is compatible with any Angi face replacer and [Better Living for Angi](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58451?tab=description).
  
  
Q: What Angi replacer is that?
  
A: It's from the [Northbourne](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37528) NPC replacer series.
  
  
Q: Why Angi?
  
A: I always felt that Angi typically flies under people's radar. She's actually pretty fleshed out for a random NPC you find in the middle of nowhere (by Skyrim standards). Most NPCs of that sort are pretty generic and only have one or two lines of dialogue.
