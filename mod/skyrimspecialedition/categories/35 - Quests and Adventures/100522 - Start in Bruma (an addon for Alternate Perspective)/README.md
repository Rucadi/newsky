# Start in Bruma (an addon for Alternate Perspective)

As for the version 1.2 the mod includes three Bruma starts:
  
1. Spawns you on the edge of map for Beyond Skyrim - Bruma, near a bridge.
  
2. Spawns you in the cathedral of St. Martin.
  
3. Spawns you near the hidden Talos shrine. Be aware of Thalmor.
  
  
This mod is separated from my another Alternate Perspective addon as it requires the Bruma mod (obviously).
  
  
Thanks to JaySerpa who proposed the 2nd and the 3rd options.
  
  
Versions:
  
1.2 is the last version compatible with AP v3.x.
  
2.0 is compatible with AP v4.x.
