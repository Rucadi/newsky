# Favor Quests Separated

**Introduction**
  
  
In the vanilla game, there are several favor quests that are shared over different locations. Starting one of them locks you out of any other ones that share the same quest, in other locations.
  
  
For instance, Amren in Whiterun will ask you to retrieve his family sword, while Shahvee in Windhelm asks to retrieve her amulet of Zenithar. These two "tasks" cannot be active at the same time, since they're technically one quest. This mod makes that particular one into two seperate quests, so both can be active at the same time.
  
  
I found this restriction to be unneeded and as such, I went on a quest (no pun intended) to seperate all of them. These include:
  
  

  
* [Delivery](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Delivery)
[A Few Words with You](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:A_Few_Words_with_You)
  
* [Some Light Theft](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Some_Light_Theft)
[Kill the bandit leader](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Kill_the_Bandit_Leader)
  
* [Rare Gifts](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Rare_Gifts)
[Dungeon Delving (Bandits)](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dungeon_Delving_(Bandits))
  
* [Dungeon Delving (Caves)](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dungeon_Delving_(Caves))

  
  
In total, this covers 32 quests. (In Vanilla, only 7 can be active at the same time.)
  
  
**Bounty Quests**
  
  
As of v2.0 Bounty quests are included. All of them are separate now, like the favor quests.
  
  
Note: As of 2.5, to activate these changes to the bounty quests, you need to have the optional Bounty Quest file activate.
  
Reason: The edits to the bounty quests were conflicting with many other mods that already overhaul them. As such, I made them optional. To avoid any potential issues when updating, all changes are containing within the main plugin, but to have the changes to bounty quests active, you'll need to activate the optional file.
  
  
The bounty quests now give leveled gold, instead of the "down payment" of a merely 100 gold.
  
  
There are 4 types of bounty quests: [Bandit](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Bounty_Quests), [Forsworn](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Bounty:_Forsworn), [Giant](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Bounty:_Giant) and [Dragon](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Bounty:_Dragon).
  
  
[Bandits](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Bounty:_Forsworn) Bounties can be done in any Hold and don't have a level requirement to become available.
  
  
[Dragons](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Bounty:_Dragon) Bounties can be done in any Hold and have the following requirements to become available:
  
  

  
* Completion of [Dragon Rising](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dragon_Rising)
Minimum level of 30.
  
* Not having completed the main quest.

  
[Forsworn](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Bounty:_Forsworn) Bounties can be done in the Reach and don't have a level requirement to become available.
  
  
Since they are only Forsworn Camps in the Reach, I replaced their bounties with something more appropriate in other holds:
  
  

  
* Beasts (no reqs): Haafingar, Whiterun, The Rift
Draugr (req: level 15): Hjaalmarch, The Pale, Winterhold
  
* Warlock (req: level 15): Falkreath, Eastmarch

  
[Giant](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Bounty:_Giant) Bounties can be done in Whiterun, Eastmarch and the Pale, and have a level requirement of level 20.
  
  
Since they are only Giant Camps in Whiterun, Eastmarch and the Pale, I replaced their bounties with something more appropriate in other holds:
  
  

  
* Beast (no reqs): Hjaalmarch
Spriggan (req: level 20): Falkreath
  
* Falmer (req: level 25): Winterhold
Draugr (req: level 15): Rift
  
* Hagraven (req: level 25): Reach
Vampire (req: level 30): Haafingar
  

  
**Compatibility**
  
  
Any mods that reference/edit these favor quests need a patch.
  
  
Compatibility for [Completionist - Skyrim Completion Tracker](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46358) is included within the scripts.
  
  
I've uploaded a patch for [BUVARP SE RE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56120) on [its patch page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56878).
  
  
A patch for [The Choice is Yours](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3850) can be found under optional downloads. Make sure the load order is as follows:
  
  

  
* TheChoiceisYours.esp
Favor Quests Seperated.esp
  
* Favor Quests Separated - The Choice Is Yours Patch.esp

If you're using [Headhunter- Bounties Redone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51847?), do **NOT** use the optional file for bounties, Favor Quests Separated - Bounty Quests as they're incompatible. The main file should be compatible though.**[USSEP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266) is highly recommended, since it fixes many of the favor quests. It isn't a hard requirement, as you can use this mod without it, but I will be unable to help you if you don't use USSEP. If you do use USSEP, make sure to use the USSEP patch as well. (optional downloads)**
  
  
A patch is available for USSEP + [Open Civil War](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11076) as well, but it also requires the USSEP patch.
  
  
A patch for [Bounty Preview](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33877) has been provided by [Enodoc](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/44986852) and is available in the optional downloads.
  
  
**FAQ**
  
  
Q: ESPFE?
  
A: Yes.
  
  
Q: Does installing/updating/uninstalling on an existing save work?
  
A: As far as I know, it should. However, it's good practice to keep a backup save prior to doing this, just in case.
  
  
Q: Is this compatible with <insert mod>?
  
A: I don't know by heart. You might need to check yourself.
  
  
Q: Will you make a patch for <insert mod>?
  
A: Only if it's a mod I use myself or plan on using, I have enough time and I actually like the idea. Otherwise, feel free to do it yourself. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: I have a suggestion to improve the mod. Can you do it?
  
A: Maybe, if I have time and I like the idea, I'll consider it.
  
  
Q: Will you port this to <insert platform>?
  
A: No, I myself only support the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If someone else wants to port it, feel free. (see permission) If you decide to port it, you yourself take full responsibility to offer support to said port. I will not provide no support for any ports by third parties.
  
  
Q: I use a ported version of this mod on <insert platform> and I have a problem. Can you help?
  
A: I don't provide any support for third party ports on other platforms than the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If you have issues, you should adress the person that ported it.
  
  
Q: Does this work on Skyrim 1.6+, aka "Anniversary Edition"?
  
A: Yes, it should.
  
  
Q: Why don't your mods use MCMs and instead use this janky console command system to set globals?
  
A: I am not a fan of MCMs. You can set the globals by making a patch in xEdit. I have no plans of changing this. If you want to add an MCM, feel free. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: Why don't you use FOMODs?
  
A: That would require reuploading the entire mod, in question, even if I only make a small change. My internet is limited and reuploading the files each time will take a huge chunk of my monthly volume.
