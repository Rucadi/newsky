About

  
Meridia's Order is an expansive questline mod, which includes over 15 new quests, most of which have different ways to complete them. Taking from Fallout: New Vegas' goal to have dynamic quests, in this mod - it is often down to the player to decide how they wish to complete a quest or progress the story. Meet the members of Meridia's Order, and work with them in the fight against dangerous Necromancers, seeking to raise a dangerous ancient being. Infiltrate groups, turn your enemies against each other and decide which of your enemies live... and who dies.
  
  
Meridia's Order is an amalgamation of everything I have learned during my time of modding Skyrim. I initially began modding Skyrim in 2012, and have come a very long way since then. I have always been interested in Skyrim's guilds, and previous mods of mine have reflected this. Meridia's Order has been a passion project of mine since 2020, and I have worked incredibly hard to ensure that it is the best one I have created yet. This mod contains my most well developed characters to date, and hopefully you will find it to be an incredibly engaging story too.
  

How to Begin
  
﻿

To begin the story, you must have completed the quest 'The Break of Dawn'. The quest is available after reaching level 12, and either finding Meridia's Beacon, or travelling to her statue near Solitude.
  
  
Once 'The Break of Dawn' is completed, either wait in any major city to be greeted by one of Meridia's Order's Paladins, or travel to the Sanctum yourself and speak with High Priestess Alara. The Sanctum is located near Rimerock Burrow, far west of Solitude.
