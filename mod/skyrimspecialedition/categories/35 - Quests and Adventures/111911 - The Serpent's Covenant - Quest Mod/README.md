**The Serpent's Covenant**

**Introduction:**
  

  
* The Serpent's Covenant is an encounter based quest mod centred around the titular guild, the Serpent's Covenant. Within the quest, you'll be accompanying a travelling mercenary, Alexia who seeks to end the titular guild by killing its leader as she believes they seek to end all civilised society. Along the way, she'll be meeting a rather interesting member of the guild who will guide her to the head of the organisation, and inform her of the true motivations of the faction.

  

  
**Features****:**
  
  

  
* **Unique questline.** The premise, backstory and characters within the guild are all incredibly unique and result in themes that are not present in Skyrim being the focal point of the mod. This allows for hard questions to be asked of the player and to make them really think about what is being discussed.

  
* **Fully voiced.**The mod features extremely high-quality voice acting done by veterans of the industry. These individuals have all brought their characters to life, and ensured that these NPCs don't just feel like characters within a game. To not spoil any future characters that appear within the mod, I will include all their names down in the credits section.

  
* **300+ lines of dialogue.﻿﻿﻿** The three NPCs within the mod have a combined line count of over 300, the two main characters sharing 250 lines. While it was not my mission to make these characters have a plethora of dialogue options, it allows for the player to ask any relevant questions they could think of to learn more about this unique guild.This allows the mod to have around 40 minutes of pure dialogue, which as mentioned, is all performed to an incredibly high standard.

  
* **New points of interest.** To make the guild feel organic and not forced in for the sake of the mod, with the help of [JenzAmaka](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/185677)﻿ and [size=2][size=2][size=2] [Exit](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/8722780)[/size][/size], we have created seven points of interest for the player to explore. All of these new locations are unmarked but feature unique narratives that further the themes discussed within the mod. While new, we made sure that the new locations feel right at home within Skyrim's world design and not like they were randomly placed within the world.[/size]

  
* **Consequences for your actions.** The mod will feature a rather tough decision that the player will have to make. Whenever this choice is made, and some time has passed, its consequences will become apparent. The choice you made has real weight and you must bear your actions.

  
* **Unique armour and weapons.** With custom assets, I have distributed unique sets and weapons to the characters within the questline. This should help them stand out and really sell the stories that they tell.

  
* **Scenes.** For the first time in all my mods, characters will now speak to one another about some relevant information. This may allow the player to get a deeper look into the relationships and feelings that each NPC is experiencing. While not overly long or detailed, they will hopefully make the characters feel more life-like and real.

  
**Showcase:**
  
  
**FAQ:**Can the mod be downloaded mid-game?
  

  
* **Yes, it's completely fine to install mid-game.**

Is it ESLed?
  

  
* **It is now! Thank you to [size=2]NukuNookee** and CharderoTheLupe for getting it done![/size]

Is the mod clean?
  

  
* **Yes, I have only edited the necessary cells, there should be no conflicts due to dirty edits.**

How do I start the quest?
  

  
* **You need to visit the specified location on the mod and speak to Alexia. Each location can be found within screenshots within the image tab.**

How do I end an encounter?
  

  
* **This might be going into spoiler territory but they're minor at most. To properly end the encounters, you must speak to Alexia and exhaust her dialogue, then speak to Alric and finish his dialogue, then once again speak to Alexia to confirm that you'll be leaving. This was the easiest way of doing it and made the most sense from a logical stand point. I don't want to have to reply to comments confused about this, so please read this bit :))**

She's just sitting there after I said goodbye, is that normal?
  

  
* **Yep! Just wait a few hours and he'll move on.**

Can I make a patch for the mod?
  

  
* **I'd love if people made patches for any incompatibilities that arise, if you could send these to me I'll upload them onto the mod page**

Can it be ported to Xbox?
  

  
* **The original porter who would do all of my mods can no longer do it. If you're up to it and agree to give credit along with including my showcases on the page, I have no problems with you porting it.**

  
**Bugs/Incompatibilities:**

  
* If you're running any version PRIOR to the update, please download [BEES](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441)﻿

  
* If you want Alexia's clothes to function properly, please download [Faster HDT-SMP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57339) [size=2]﻿as without it, her clothes will be bugged[/size]

  
**Disclaimer:**

  
* Alex Cain, a voice actor for this mod does not grant permission to clone/replicate their voice, using AI, line splicing, or any other means. Please refrain from doing so.
