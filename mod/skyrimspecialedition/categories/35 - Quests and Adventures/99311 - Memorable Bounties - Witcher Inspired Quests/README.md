**Memorable Bounties**

  
**Introduction:**To me, bounties in Skyrim were always incredibly boring and lacked any real kind of weight when completing them. Memorable Bounties attempts to remedy this. This mod does not overhaul the pre-existing bounties but adds three very interesting and unique bounties for the player to take. Below, there is a linked video that briefly shows off the quality of the voice actors and the premise of the quests. **These bounties are not repeatable and are just standalone quests, they are not radiant quests.** Further below, I will fully outline the three new quests and how you can start them.
  
**Showcase:**
  
  
**Sins of Silver:**The quest can be started by either finding a bounty within Windhelm's inn or venturing to Frostholm yourself. Upon arriving at the newly added village, you'll find a manic citizen, voiced acted by [Juniper Berry](https://huberd.carrd.co/), who warns you about what caused the village to be destroyed. After heeding his warning, you can investigate Frostholm and its ruins and speak to a mercenary who is ([Alex Cain](https://www.castingcall.club/complete-the-circuit)) responsible for the village's destruction. After learning of his story, you will be forced to make a moral decision with two drastically different endings. The quest is heavily inspired by the Witcher 3 quest "Where the Cat and Wolf Play".
  
  
**The Great Deceiver:**This quest can be started by going to the Dead Man's Drink in Falkreath and reading a bounty on a mysterious beast due to the murder of a family. From there, it will direct you to an old man, voiced acted by [Max Lefferts,](https://www.castingcall.club/Max-L) who has details on the creature. There, you will learn the details of the contract and that the family was that of a young boy now under the man's protection. After speaking with him, you will be sent off to kill the monster. Once you arrive at its lair, you will have the opportunity to speak with the monster and learn of its harrowing story.
  
  
**The Path to Redemption:**The final quest of the mod can also be started by picking up a bounty, this time in Winterhold. It tells the player of an incredibly dangerous bandit leader who has taken to hiding within the mountains of the hold. Once you arrive at his secluded cabin, you will find Balen, (voiced acted by [Alex Cain](https://www.castingcall.club/complete-the-circuit)), a retired bandit who has now turned to the Nine Divines in an attempt to repent for his sins. Speaking with the man, you will learn of his terrible past and the sins he has committed. From there, you will have to make the decision of whether the man should live or die.
