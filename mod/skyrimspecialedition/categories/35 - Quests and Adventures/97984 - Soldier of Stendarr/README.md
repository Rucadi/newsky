Allows you to turn in vampire dust, werewolf pelts, and daedra hearts to the vigilants in exchange for money, if you are wearing the amulet of stendarr. ESL Flagged.
  
  
5 vampire dust = 200 gold
  
2 werewolf pelts = 300 gold
  
1 daedra heart = 500 gold
  
  
Repeatable. It does not activate a quest, so there is no tracker. Either you have the stuff or you don't.
  
  
This mod does not alter any npc records, nor adds anything to the game other than a quest dialogue that is available if you are wearing the amulet of stendarr, and you are talking to a member of the Vigilant of Stendarr faction. Should be compatible with anything.
