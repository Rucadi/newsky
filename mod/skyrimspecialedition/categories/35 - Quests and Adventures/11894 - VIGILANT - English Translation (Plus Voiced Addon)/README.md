[VIGILANT](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11849/?). An amazing quest mod made by Vicn, requiring the player to join the Vigilants of Stendarr and help them keep Skyrim safe from the influence of malevolent forces ... and then a certain Daedric Prince takes a very personal interest in the newest member of the Vigilants.

Up until some time ago, you could play this mod only partially translated into English. But you waited and eventually, an English translation was complete. Something was still missing, though.
  
  
All the characters were silent.
  
  
But now ... we have a solution for you. The mod before you is an English voice acting addon for Vigilant, brought to you by 23 incredibly talented voice actors and the author of the latest English translation. Most of the characters you will meet during your journey as a Vigilant of Stendarr are now voiced and waiting to talk to you.
  
  
We hope you will enjoy this addon.
  
  
**NOTE**: With recent content updates to VIGILANT (1.6.0+), this addon no longer covers every character in the mod. They will be voiced at a later date, after Vicn finalizes his work. Thank you for understanding.
  
  
**Characters that are currently not voiced (enable subtitles for those):**
  
  
[font=Arial]- Anton the Brilliant (follower of Meridia during The Eye of Madness and Thus Spoke Khajiit)
  
- Mar'so (during the alternate resolution of Thus Spoke Khajiit)
  
- Carene and Lillian during an alternate resolution of Ivarstead witches (Art of Mercy)
  
- Thorondir following the alternate resolution of Ivarstead witches (Art of Mercy)
  
- Chick Trader (during one radiant quest)
  
- Gwyneth (only lines about the anatomancer directing you to the epilogue/The Sacred Anatomancer)
  
- Sacred Anatomancer/Pale Feet (prisoner in the Temple of Stendarr, in Coldharbour and during the epilogue/The Sacred Anatomancer)
  
- Pipers (during the evil path of the epilogue/The Sacred Anatomancer)
  
[size=3]- Belharza (found in Coldharbour if you explore a bit, and no, I don't mean the flashback after Varla)
  
- Saklas the Man-Ape (in Coldharbour, in the starting village inside Heretic's House)
  
- Bandit Kanra (in Coldharbour, in the starting village inside Bandit Kanra's Lair)
  
- all the Minotaurs (Temple of Stendarr and Minotaur Village during the Legacy of Belharza)
  
- Martha (in the good karma resolution of her brother's flashback)
  
  
  
[/size]**You are** **NOT** **allowed to clone or train AI models on any of the voices included in this mod under any circumstances.**[/font]
  
  
  
Our addon is available on Skyrim Classic version (2011) as well.

**Q: Is this a full mod?**
  
A: No. This is just sound files and a translated .esp and patch file. You still need the original Vigilant mod for all the meshes, textures, etc.
  
  
**Q: Do I need a separate translation file for this?**
  
A: No. The latest English .esp file is included. You only need the original Vigilant mod and its requirements.
  
  
**Q: I don't like some of the voices.**
  
A: No one says you have to. And that's not a question. In any case, if you really hate the voiced version so much, there is a text only English translation available in the Optional Files section.
  
  
[size=3]**Q: Why are some characters saying vanilla Skyrim greetings/farewells/combat shouts?**
  
A: That's an unfortunate limitation of Vicn using vanilla voice types (like MaleBrute, FemaleYoungEager) instead of creating custom ones. Yes, we know it can be annoying. On the upside, that makes the voice acting pack compatible with every other translation.
  
  
There is an optional file with a custom plugin (Vigilant Voiced.esp) available that suppresses this voice switching. **However, be aware that while this file fixes this particular issue, it may introduce entirely different issues instead (like broken follower and merchant functionality for certain characters). As such, it is no longer supported and you use it at your own risk.**
  
This file will be recreated with full functionality at a later date once the entire Vicn's quest saga is completed and ready to be (re)voiced.

Characters are switching between vanilla voices and their custom voices for greetings/goodbyes/generic combat lines.
  
  
Optional plugin (Vigilant Voiced.esp) suppresses that, but in turn it breaks some characters' follower and/or merchant functionality.
  
Unsupported as of VIGILANT 1.8.0 and will no longer receive any updates. Use it at your own risk.
