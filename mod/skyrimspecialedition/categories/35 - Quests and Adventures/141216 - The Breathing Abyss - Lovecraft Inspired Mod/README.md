**The Breathing Abyss**

**[b][size=5][u]Introduction:**[/u][/size][/b]

  
* The Breathing Abyss is a remake of a now privated mod which I produced over a year ago. This version features the same premise and revolves around a mysterious entity that resides within a large underwater cavern. Your goal is to uncover what the creature is and how it can be stopped. This will be done with the help of Manias, a researcher of the paranormal. The story from the original mod has been completely rewritten and the cavern you'll be exploring is much larger and more interesting to explore. A full list of changes can be found within the FAQ.

* **Fully voiced.** This quest has been voiced by a veteran of Skyrim modding, [D. D. Rumin](https://www.ddrumin.com/)﻿. He did an excellent job voicing the 150 lines within the mod and really brings Manias to life.
**Unique questline.** While a remake, the Breathing Abyss is incredibly unique and delves into underutilised aspects of the base game. The inclusion of a new underwater area and a story featuring obscure lore is only done in this mod. This offers a very unique horror experience that should live up to the inspirations it pays homage to.
  
* **New locations.** The focal piece of the mod, the Underwater Cavern, has been expertly made by [EXIT](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/EXITmods?gameId=1704), a veteran of Skyrim modding. This new location should offer an engaging place to explore and help uncover the mystery of the mod's story.

**FAQ:**[/u][/size][/b]Can the mod be downloaded mid-game?
  

  
* **Yes, it's completely fine to install mid-game.**

Is it ESLed?
  

  
* **It is thanks to CharderoTheLupe!**

Is the mod clean?
  

  
* **Yes, I have only edited the necessary cells, there should be no conflicts due to dirty edits.**

How do I start the quest?
  

  
* **You must speak to Manias very close to Yngvild, the nordic ruin on an island near Dawnstar.**

Why did you remake this mod?
  

  
* **While the Breathing Abyss was once my largest mod, I was never exactly happy with the quality of it or the story it told. I felt like it left a lot to be desired with all its bugs, and the story that was there was vague and too hard to decipher. I wanted to fix both these aspects and make something I was proud of which lead to this mod being released.**

What has changed from the original mod?
  

  
* **Pretty much everything. Though here's an exact list:**

  
1. **The introduction to the quest is now much more organic and easier to find**
**Manias as a person has changed, along with all his dialogue and voice acting**
  
2. **The story and explanation behind the creature has drastically changed**
**The cave has been expanded, becoming much bigger with more to explore**
  
3. **The pace of the quest has changed and is now much more involved**

Is it compatible with the old version?
  

  
* **No it's not. Don't have both versions downloaded otherwise incompatibilities will arise.**

Can I make a patch for the mod?
  

  
* **I'd love it people made patches for any incompatibilities that arise, if you could send these to me, I'll upload them onto the mod page.**

Can it be ported to Xbox?
  

  
* **[b][size=2]The original porter who would do all of my mods can no longer do it. If you're up to it and agree to give credit along with including my showcases on the page, I have no problems with you porting it.**[/size][/b]

How can I show my support?
  

  
* **You can endorse the mod and vote it for mod of the month, if you like the content. And if you'd like to support me, check out my YouTube and Patreon!**

There might be an issue with not being able to hear the sound effects of one section of the mod. I had this issue but EXIT, the other developer, didn't. I'll try fix this if others experience this.

* Thank you to all wonderful authors on Pixabay who allow their assets to be used, I would credit the original authors but they seem to only credit Pixabay.
Thank you to [cavity](https://www.cgtrader.com/cavity) on CGTrader for the model, I wouldn't recommend checking out his profile unless you've played through the mod as it might ruin some suspense of what the creature is :))
