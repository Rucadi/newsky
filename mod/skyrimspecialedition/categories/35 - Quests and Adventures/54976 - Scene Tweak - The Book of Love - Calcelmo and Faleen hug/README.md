**Description**
  
  
**This mod has been merged in [Andrealphus Scene Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/115647/).**
  
  
In my quest to fix insignificant details, I found something I wanted to adress. When you complete the part of the Book of Love quest, where you help Faleen and Calcelmo find each other, Faleen says to him: "Come here you!" and they then succeed to walk away, which ruins the whole moment.
  
  
That's where my mod comes in: Now they'll actually hug. Nothing more, nothing less.
  
  
From v1.1 onwards, Fastred will also hug Klimmek or Bassianus.
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
  
This mod has no requirements.
  
  
The only thing it edits is the T02CalcelmoFaleen scene and its corresponding script. As far as I know no mods edits this scene/script.
  
  
**FAQ**
  
  
Q: Will you implement <insert NSFW feature> /make this mod work with <NSFW content>?
  
A: No, I prefer to keep my mods familiy friendly.
  
  
Q: ESPFE?
  
A: Yes.
  
  
Q: Does installing/updating/uninstalling on an existing save work?
  
A: As far as I know, it should. However, it's good practice to keep a backup save prior to doing this, just in case.
  
  
Q: Is this compatible with <insert mod>?
  
A: I don't know by heart. You might need to check yourself.
  
  
Q: Will you make a patch for <insert mod>?
  
A: Only if it's a mod I use myself or plan on using, I have enough time and I actually like the idea. Otherwise, feel free to do it yourself. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: I have a suggestion to improve the mod. Can you do it?
  
A: Maybe, if I have time and I like the idea, I'll consider it.
  
  
Q: Will you port this to <insert platform>?
  
A: No, I myself only support the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If someone else wants to port it, feel free. (see permission) If you decide to port it, you yourself take full responsibility to offer support to said port. I will not provide no support for any ports by third parties.
  
  
Q: I use a ported version of this mod on <insert platform> and I have a problem. Can you help?
  
A: I don't provide any support for third party ports on other platforms than the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If you have issues, you should adress the person that ported it.
  
  
Q: Does this work on Skyrim 1.6+, aka "Anniversary Edition"?
  
A: Yes, it should.
  
  
Q: Why don't your mods use MCMs and instead use this janky console command system to set globals?
  
A: I am not a fan of MCMs. You can set the globals by making a patch in xEdit. I have no plans of changing this. If you want to add an MCM, feel free. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: Why don't you use FOMODs?
  
A: That would require reuploading the entire mod, in question, even if I only make a small change. My internet is limited and reuploading the files each time will take a huge chunk of my monthly volume.
