**[font=Times New Roman]*My first thought was, he lied in every word...*[/font]**
  
**Adds 70+ lines of fully voiced dialogue. All created with vanilla assets. Minimal splicing and no AI was used. Many lines are from cut content intended to be in the original Boethiah Quest but never implemented by Bethesda.**
  
  
**Mod Overview**
  
  
This mod adds an alternate way to complete Boethiah's Calling. Now a "friend" can trick and attempt to sacrifice *you* to Boethiah. Of course, the player being the main character and all, miraculously will survive the attempt on their life. Regaining consciousness hours later and on the brink of death, its up to the player to then track down the deceiver and get revenge, finding clues and dealing with traps along the way.
  
  
This effectively adds an alternate way to obtain the Ebony Mail without killing one your friends.
  
 
  
**Quest Details**This Mod adds a new Quest entitled "The Man in Black". 
  
*By default, can be started at same level as when Boeithah's Calling starts. (C[i]ustomizable in FOMOD.*Level 30 in Vanilla Skyrim, changeable with Timing is Everything etc.)[/i]
  

  
* To begin, speak with the Dark Elf, Rudin Filaro, at the Braidwood Inn in Kynesgrove.
Through dialogue, he will pose as friendly priest of Mara and will attempt to entice the player to join him on a quest.
  
* Only when the destination is reached, will his deception be realized. By then it will be too late.
Barely surviving the sacrifice ritual, the player will need to find clues and deal with traps in order to hunt down the deceiver. 
  
* When they finally reach them, they can get their revenge and obtain the Ebony Mail.

**NEW: In version 2.0 of the mod, a new voiced encounter is added to the game.**

  
* If Boethiah deems you unfit to own the Ebony Mail, a Dark Elf named Mia will hunt you down. (See Video)
This can occur even if you went the vanilla route of Boethiah's Calling.
  
* The encounter occurs randomly in the wilderness of Skyrim.

If interested, the specific condition that causes Mia to hunt you is listed below. *(WARNING SPOILERS)*
  
Spoiler
  
**If the Ebony Mail is detected in your inventory and you have less than 5 murders committed, (Based on the Murder count in Stats Tab in the in-game Menu), then Mia will hunt you down. The actual encounter will occur in the wilderness of Skyrim 2-3 weeks after the detection of the Ebony Mail occurs.**
  
The philosophy behind the ambush is adding a thematic consequence for taking the armor if your character isn't one Boethiah would want to have it. Similar, to how she sends you off to kill her previous champion in the original quest because he was unfit to have it.
  
  
*My inspiration to use murder count was based off the cut dialogue Bethesda had the original champion say. See some of the lines Below:*
  
[spoiler]
  
"Boethiah talks about leaving your mark, a sign of your passing.... Well, you can make a mark on the world without treachery and murder."
  
  
"Whenever a man's life is saved by armor made with these hands, these hands have changed that man's destiny and his family's."
  
  
"I told you. I'm done with all that. There's enough blood on these hands. I'm interested in creating things now."
  
  
"The Prince of Plots usually gets what she wants. I'm surprised I'm not dead already. She must have had some reason to keep me alive so
  
long."
  
  
"So you can tell that heartless Daedra b&@\*$ I'm done doing her dirty work."
  
  
"Mind my words or I'll mind them for you: I'm slave to no man, no god, and no Daedra."
  
  
Basically, the previous Champion didn't want to be a mass murderer so Boethiah scorned him and sent someone to assassinate him.
  
  
Additionally, from a gameplay stand point, in the base game to get the ebony mail you need to kill a friendly NPC as payment to get it.
  
Since, in my mod, that is no longer a requirement, I wanted to introduce the ambush as counterbalance. The thought being you can go the good guy route, it's just going to be more difficult.

*You can see some of the gameplay of the mod in the video showcase below: (WARNING SPOILERS) Big thanks to [SaberPlays](https://www.youtube.com/@SayberPlays) for making the awesome video.*
  
*Some videos I made myself that aren't as well edited are also below:*
  
 **Compatibility and Installation**As of 1.4 mod this is fully safe to install mid game no matter if the original Boethiah Quest has been started or not.
  
 
  
 This mod will have **little to no conflicts** with most, if not all mods. The original Boethiah quest itself was not touched by the esp.
  
  
In addition, all NPCs make use of vanilla templates for spells, perks, and stats meaning that mods like [Requiem](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60888) are compatible out of the box.
  
  
A compatibility patch made by [ChickenMike](https://forums.nexusmods.com/profile/70500678-chickenmike/) for the Great Village of Kynesgrove is available in the FOMOD.
  
  
A patch for [Boethiah's Bidding](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18854) is also available in the FOMOD.
  
You can see how it plays out in the video below:
  
Spoiler
  
  
With the patch is installed, if the quest from my mod is completed, then putting on the ebony mail will also start Boethiah's Bidding. (Boethiah's Bidding can still be started the normal way as well.)
  
Note that after the "Boethiah's Calling" quest starts, it will be in your journal until eithers its completed or my quest, "The Man in Black", is completed. No gameplay is affected, so just ignore it. Had to do it this way because of how Boethiah's Bidding is implemented.
  
  
Additionally, if choosing to use this patch you cannot use the "Start quest at any level" option for my quest in the FOMOD. Again this is due to how Boethiah's Bidding is implemented.
