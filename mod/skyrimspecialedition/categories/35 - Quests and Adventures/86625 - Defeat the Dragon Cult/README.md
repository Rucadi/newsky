**Defeat the Dragon Cult**
  
  
This mod aims the expand the later half of the main quest by giving the Dragonborn a reason to fight and kill all of the Dragon Priests in Skyrim before facing Alduin at the Throat of the World. After Paarthurnax tells you that you need to find an Elder Scroll, Esbern will send you a note, telling you that the Dragon Priests are sworn to Alduin, and that defeating them will prevent them helping Alduin when you face him. This mod is entirely roleplaying, Alduin isn't actually buffed by the Dragon Priests, the aim is to give the Dragonborn an excuse to ignore the main quest until the end of the game.

* The quest provides markers to all the Dragon Priests.
You are also told about the Wooden Mask in Labyrinthian, giving you a roleplaying reason to investigate that.
  
* The quest can be ignored entirely, and the main quest completed as usual.

  
The idea came from redditor Vantadvst, and is designed to work with [Cult of the World Eater - Dragon Priests Buff Alduin](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/83274/?tab=description)﻿ by Maleficus32, while that mod buffs Alduin, giving the Player a reason to kill the Dragon Priests, this gives the Dragonborn the same incentives. This also works with my At Your Own Pace.
