**What is Fortune's Tradehouse?**
  
Fortune's Tradehouse is a lore friendly quest mod for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. It adds a new location to Markarth, a tradehouse run by an eccentric Imperial named Fortune. The mod includes a main quest, four side quests, and eleven uniquely voiced NPCs.
  
  
  
  
**Starting the quest:**
  
Fortune’s Tradehouse is located in the northern part of Markarth. Speak with Ut-Keen to start the quest. You can find him standing by the entrance.
  
  
**Installation:**
  
Install with a mod manager of your choice, or manually install by placing the ESP and BSA files in your data folder, then activating the
  
mod from Skyrim’s launcher.
  
  
I highly recommend installing “Fix Lip Sync” by meh321. This is a plugin for the Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE) that fixes lip sync issues with Skyrim, and as such, requires SKSE.

**Compatibility:**
  
Small changes have been made to the city of Markarth. I cannot guarantee compatibility with mods that make significant changes to the city.

Kulharin and robertgk2017 were kind enough to take time to address some navmesh and miscellaneous issues  for the 2.0 version of the mod.
