**Memorable Stories**

**Introduction:**
  
Memorable Stories is a very small mod that simply adds seven both horror and non-horror themed notes and journals to various locations around Skyrim. Some of these texts aim to enhance the atmosphere and mood of pre-existing locations and others are there to add a new story to various locations.
  
  
**Features:**

  
* **Well-written texts.** Memorable Stories features (as of this moment) seven stories that are all incredibly well written. They should seamlessly fit into the pre-existing world and add a new sense of horror to various locations.
