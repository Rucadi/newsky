**Quests Are In Skyrim** makes radiant quest no longer send you to locations outside of the province of Skyrim. More exactly, only locations that belong to one of the nine vanilla holds are chosen when choosing a target for the respective quest. Note that this affects only quests started **after** the installation of the mod - and sometimes quests are already running without the player being notified. 
  
The following quests are affected:
  
 - The Break of Dawn
