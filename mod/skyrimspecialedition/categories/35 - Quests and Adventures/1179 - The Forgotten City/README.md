**A MESSAGE FROM THE AUTHOR**

I've moved on from modding to professional game development, but please feel free to connect with me via [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Nick-James-Pearce-415000898693530/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXIhbVLrISW4fSi9LaMV9jQ), and/or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ModnStoryteller), and [visit my webpage](http://modern-storyteller.com/)﻿ for news!

  
  
  
**SUMMARY**
  
  
The Forgotten City is the first mod in history to win a national Writers' Guild award with its script. It is a critically acclaimed expansion mod offering a unique 6 - 8 hour experience: a murder mystery investigation set in an ancient underground city. You'll need to solve it using your wits, and the ability to travel through time. It has a dark, non-linear story in which you'll interrogate suspects, explore the city and its many secrets, and navigate challenging moral dilemmas. It features multiple endings, an original orchestral score, and professionally voiced dialogue.

*"The story here is, no doubt, the best of any Skyrim mod. It's so good, that it really reminds me of Blockbuster movies like Inception, Interstellar, and especially Edge of Tomorrow, and it's so cinematic as well, especially the custom composed soundtrack."* [MxR](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAiDQmR48fI&t=3m52s), Skyrim Mods Weekly
