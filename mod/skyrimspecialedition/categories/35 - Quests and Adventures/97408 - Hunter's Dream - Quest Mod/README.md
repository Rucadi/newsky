**Hunter's Dream****Introduction:**

  
* Hunter's Dream is a quest mod that features Vashharr, a Khajiiti mercenary who has grown tired of his current occupation. Vashhar will travel all across Skyrim and here, the player can speak to him of his woes, regrets in life and can engage in moral discussions with Vashharr. Furthermore, he will tell the player about his tragic past and the beliefs he has gained after his many years of being a sellsword.

**Features****:**
  

  
* **Fully voiced.**The mod features extremely high quality voice acting done by [robbobert](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5284088), the author of Khajiit Will Follow!﻿
**Unique questline.** As stated in the introduction, Hunter's Dream will delve into many interesting topics and discussions where the player can fully express their opinions on the world around them, even if that conflicts with Vashharr's views.
  

  
**FAQ:**

  
* **Can the mod be downloaded mid-game?**

Yes, it's completely fine to install mid-game.

  
* **Is it ESLed?**

Sorry about this one, the mod wasn't ESLed in 1.0 as I'm an idiot and didn't add the flag back on before uploading the mod but in 1.1, it is now :))

  
* **Is the mod clean?**

Yes, I have only edited the necessary cells, there should be no conflicts due to dirty edits.
  

  
* [size=2]**Is this a follower mod?**
  
No, it's an encounter based quest mod, Vashharr will never be a follower.
  

  
* **Is the name a reference to Bloodborne?**

Yes! Both me and robbobert love the game so we thought we'd reference it with the name.
  

  
* **Where can I find Vashharr?**

[/size]All the locations he visits can be seen in the images tab.
