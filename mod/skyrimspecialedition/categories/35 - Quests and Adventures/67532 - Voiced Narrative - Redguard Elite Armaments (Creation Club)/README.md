**XBOX version also available on Bethesda.net!**
  
  
While not everyone might use the armor, Redguard Elite Armaments has a short quest that involves some espionage, some Hammerfell lore tidbits, and some good old Thalmor thrashing which I think is pretty nice. The reused generic lines in this quest are not bad compared to other Creation Club contents, but the Remnants and its leader just seem too important to be introduced by the hollow generic lines. With Voiced Narrative, Fijeh will have a bit more to say about the situation, which helps player get a sense of his personality, and in turn makes his character a more interesting and memorable spymaster instead of a talking notice board.

**FAQ:**
  
**Is this ESL-flagged (ESPFE)?**
  
Yes.
  
  
**Is this compatible with Unofficial Skyrim Creation Club Content Patches?**
  
Yes.
  
**[b]I noticed some grammar errors and thought a few lines could be improved?**
  
[/b]I'm always open to any feedback on improving dialogue and grammar**,**but please provide helpful feedback over one-liner criticism.
  
**Is this compatible with my face overhaul mod that change the same NPCs from this mod?**
  
Yes, it only changes dialogue records, NPCs are left intact.
  
  
**Will this break my save?**
  
This mod mainly edited dialogue records that already existed. It's safe to install mid game; removing it will just revert everything back to vanilla lines.
