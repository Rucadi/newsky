> *Vaermina lights the sky of our world! Vaermina is the stars of our world! Her thousand truths are a thousand lights in the night sky!*

  
  
﻿Demon of Dream is an unmarked quest centered around 3 ex-cultists of Vaermina, all trapped in their own minds after an attempt to get back at the Mistress of Dream. Encounter several unique enemies, including Vaermina's own minions: The Omen.
  
  
Whether it be to end their suffering, or to find valuable artifacts and spells, you decide to venture into their minds and defeat their worst nightmares.
  
  
Like TES 4's Oblivion Gates, and Dragonborn's Black Books, these explorable dreams are small, dungeon-like pockets of Oblivion. Each of the three dreams are designed to match their dreamer: Both their fears and desires are present within the dream, holding you hostage until you conquer them on behalf of the dreamer. You cannot leave the dream until it is resolved.
  
  
The quest begins with the acquisition of the Idol of Vaermina, within Cragwallow Slope. There, you will find a note next to the artifact, explaining how it works and where the dreamers can be found.
  
The dreams can be tackled in any order, but the one at Greenwall is designed to be the final of the three.
  
Recommended level: 15+

Grab Nilarion's Skull to trade it to the Omen of Possibilities. Or use it as decoration, if you don't feel like submitting what's left of Nilarion's mind to Vaermina.
  
  
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
This mod uses Cragwallow Slope, Fort Greenwall, Riverside Shack, and Autumnshade Clearing. Any mods that interfere with these areas might affect Demon of Dream, such as:
  
*Evolving Locations - Riverside Shack*
  
  
**Known Issues**Spoiler
  
~~The Servant's Mask only uses one model, no matter your race, sex, or weight. I just couldn't get it to work any other way. To make up for it, you can trade your masks in for an enchanted sword at the Omen of Possibilities.~~ **NOW FIXED. All credit goes to**[CharderoTheLupe](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/CharderoTheLupe/about-me)**﻿ for designing functioning models for the helmet!**
  
  
If two different casters use Warm Slumber on the same person before the effect wears off, the slowness effect can stack in reverse and speed up attack animation for a few seconds. Until I find a fix just pretend this is intentional and actually represents fear caused by a hallucination or something.
