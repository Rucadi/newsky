**Description**
  
Whenever you purchase any Dwemer armor or weapon, there is a chance that you'll be accosted by a courier sent by [Calcelmo](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Calcelmo), requesting a meeting to purchase said armor or weapon. If you have already sold that armor or weapon, you will neither be able to complete nor fail [the quest](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Buy_Dwarven_artifact) until you obtain the exact item again. Good luck finding another Dwarven Bow of Freezing or some similar rare enchanted item.
  
  
This mod makes it so you can tell Calcelmo that you won't sell him the item, even if you don't have it. You can also tell him to never bother you about your Dwemer purchases again.
