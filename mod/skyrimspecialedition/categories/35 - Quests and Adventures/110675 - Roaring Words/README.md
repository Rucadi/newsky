# Roaring Words

Add a quest marker to all word walls when you ask Arngeir if he's located any Words of Power. The words no longer hhhwwwisper. They roar.
  
  
This only adds markers for locations that would normally be available to the vanilla quest. That means no DLC word walls and no walls locked behind quests (except Dustman's Cairn for some reason. Thanks Bethesda.).
  
  
ESL flagged and should be safe to add mid-game. Just install it with a Mod Manager.
  
  
This mod does modify a vanilla script, but it should be compatible with anything that doesn't modify QF\_FreeformHighHrothgarA\_000E76DE.pex. May require a patch for things that change WordWallTrigger, but it should be really easy to do in xEdit. May also require a patch for things that add additional locations to the list that the vanilla quest can use.
  
  
I've done some basic testing both on a clean save and a modded save, but I'm not super knowledgeable about quests so there could be more insidious bugs that I didn't find.
  
  
You can also use a console command to start the quest:

```
setstage rw_mainquest 10
```

  
or mark everything complete and stop the quest:

```
setstage rw_mainquest 20
```
