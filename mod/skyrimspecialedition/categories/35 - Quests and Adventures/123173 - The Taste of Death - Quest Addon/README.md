[size=4]**Adds 50+ lines of fully voiced dialogue. All created with vanilla assets. Minimal splicing and no AI was used.**[/size]
  
**Mod Overview**
  
This mod extends the vanilla quest, "The Taste of Death", allowing the player to root out the Cult of Namira and bring them to justice. Additionally, this mod (Optionally) adds a route for non-evil players to obtain the Ring of Namira from its previous owner. Additional gameplay features and enemies are added as well. All features added by this mod are modular via the FOMOD installer, so if you can pick and choose what you want to have installed.
  
  
**Extended Quest**
  

  
* A journal has been added to Eola's inventory. If you slay her and read it before agreeing to sacrifice Verulus, the new quest "A Bitter Aftertaste" begins.
**As of v4 there are three dialogue options to get Eola to attack you in order to start the new quest:**
  

  
1. In the Hall of the Dead by selecting "Your tricks won't work on me, monster.".
Outside of Reachcliff cave selecting "I didn't come to help. I'm here to end you, monster!".
  
2. After clearing Reachcliff Cave with Eola, when she asks you to bring her a victim, selecting "Helping you was a mistake. I'm not going to let you hurt anyone.".

  
* The contents of her journal allude to the other members of her cult but never outright name them.
The player will be compelled to explore Reachcliff Cave to uncover possible clues on the identities of the other cannibals in Markarth.
  
* In doing so the player will come across the Ring of Namira and, optionally, **a new boss fight**.
Once the cannibals have been identified, you can confront them directly, resulting in combat. However, **if you talk to Brother Verulus and the Jarl beforehand**, you gain the option of being able to arrest them. Alternatively, as of v3, you can now blackmail the cannibals for gold instead.
  
* Install this option if want to get Ring without being a cannibal yourself.  *(Note: The "Extended Quest" esp is the only one needed to acquire the Ring if that's all your interested in, the others below just compliment obtaining the ring in this way.)*
For players that want to confront the cult but do **not** want to acquire the Ring in the process, select the "**No Ring**" option in FOMOD. If enabled, the player **won't obtain the Ring of Namira** in the new quest. All the new dialogue and other features will remain enabled.
  

  
**New Boss Battle**
  

  
* The previous Champion of Namira is added as an undead boss to the final chamber of Reahcliff Cave.
His backstory is fully explained in-game via a journal found the chamber.
  
* The fight has two stages. When he is close to being defeated, a Daedric Parasite emerges from his body.
If installed, the boss will be present during original Taste of Death quest as well.
  

  
**The Curse of the Ring**
  

  
* Optional hardcore gameplay addition. If installed, while the ring is in your inventory, the only way to reduce hunger is through cannibalism.

*You can see some of the gameplay of the mod in the video showcase below: (WARNING SPOILERS) Big thanks to [SaberPlays](https://www.youtube.com/@SayberPlays) for making the awesome video.*  
*[i]Some videos I made myself that aren't as well edited are also below:*[/i]
  
  
  
**Compatibility and Installation**Requires [Backported Extended ESL Support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441) if using an older Skyrim version.
  
  
This mod is fully safe to install and update midgame.
  
  
If installed on save where Eola has already been killed by the player, the quest will start itself automatically.
  
  
No vanilla records have been modified so the mod should be compatible with most other mods.
  
  
A Requiem patch is offered in the FOMOD to balance the new boss. Make sure to run the reqtificator as well.
  
  
For the "Cursed Ring" addon, I think I made patches for all the notable survival mods. Let me know if I missed one.
