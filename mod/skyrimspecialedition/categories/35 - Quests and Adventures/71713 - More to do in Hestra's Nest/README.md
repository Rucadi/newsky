Protect the town, hire guards, join the Wardens, there are lots of opportunities for you to help the citizens of Hestra's Nest. This mod adds a total of **18 quests in Hestra's Nest** from the mod [Hestra's Nest by the Arcane University students](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70098), because I felt like it would be a waste not to add more content in this beautiful piece of land. A **new player home** was also added for the player to be able to rest inside the area with most crafting tools and safe storage at the same spot.
  
  
I recommend using [Revoiced Hestra's Nest](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/109009/) and [Hestra's Nest - Dragon Patch by brandiuntz](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/83811) alongside this mod, so that all OG characters are fully voice-acted and dragons won't clip through the ground in Hestra's Nest.

* Is there a player home and where is it?

Head to the trading outpost and talk to Kaera. She will have a house available for you for only 2 500 septims. The usual "go visit your new home" will trigger once you buy it.
  
  

* Is it compatible with Hearthfire Multiple Children mod?

No. The house is very small and actually only fits one person.
  
  

* Where can I find the quests?

Talk to Kaera in the trading outpost, to the elf inside Forsworn's Findings, to the Wardens inside the Warden Temple or to Tristane Remly in the Knights of the Silver Rose barracks. You will be able to help them sort out some stuff in Hestra's Nest. While visiting the land, you will also find some small houses, campfires, ruins or temples where people might need your help.
  
  

* Who can I recruit to be Hestra's Nest guards?

Followers, vanilla and modded (in most cases). As long as they don't belong to the Dark Brotherhood, the College of Winterhold, the Companions or the Blades.
  
  

* Is this mod voiced?

All characters were voiced by real voice actors! Thanks to them for making this mod a unique experience with their talented voice acting!
