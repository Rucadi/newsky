~Face Sculptor Expanded~

The face sculptor was added to the Ratway together with the Dawnguard expansion... and even though it was a welcome addition, it's always felt like the only reason she existed was to justify giving the players a way to change their apperance (other than using the console). As such, this character felt like a gimmick and not like a proper part of the world, and I absolutely hate that. I aim to change this with this mod, making her a natural part of the Ragged Flagon.
  
  
  
**Features:**
  

  
* **Scenes and conversations**: In vanilla, the face sculptor is in the Ragged Flagon, but she might as well not be. She never speaks to anybody, and nobody speaks to her. Now she will talk and interact with other people in the Flaggon, making her seem like a natural part of the location. Fully voiced (with natural sounding spliced lines).
**NPCs request her abilities**: In vanilla, the only way to see her abilities in action is if you yourself pay for them. This makes it feel like a gaming mechanic, and not like an actual NPC with knowledge of a forgotten magic. Thanks to this mod, you might now see someone else go through the process of a face alteration, further making it seem like she is actually a part of the world and others also can use her services.
  
  
* **She behaves realistically** In vanilla, she sits on her bench 24 hours straight. She will never move or stand up. She does not sleep. She does not eat. She's there all the time in the same eternal position. What is this, Starfield?! Thanks to this mod, she will still spend most of her time studying her books and sitting, but she will at least take 2 or 3 breaks a day to stretch her legs and eat, and also even sleep for a couple of hours.
**Clearing bounties and a new tier of service:** The function to change your face has been split in two. A more superficial option, which costs 500 Gold, and "I want to be unrecognizable" option, which costs the original 1000 Gold and will also remove your current bounties in Skyrim. Both options allow you to customize your character to your liking as usual and come fully voiced with different dialogue.
  
  
* **Other immersive features:** She can give you a discount if you join the Thieves Guild, she will remember you if you changed your face in the past (in vanilla you have to hear the explanation on what she does EVERY TIME), you might encounter some of her clients after their surgeries (and you can bring it up with them for some funny easter egg moments), and if you have a *light hand*, you might even find out what events led Galathil from performing in "the greatest manors of Tamriel" to only offering her services in the sewers of Riften.

**ESL flagged?**
  
ESL flagged.
  
  
**Does this mod modify the appearance of the Face Sculptor or her clothes?**
  
No. Her NPC record is completely untouched, so replacers and similar will work without the need of patches.
  
  
**Can I still get the achievement attached to this quest?**
  
Yes, using her services will still give you the achievement. Unless of course... achievements are not working in your game. Bethesda broke them recently with their latest updates.
