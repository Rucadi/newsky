Search and Seizure is a vanilla Skyrim quest that can be started after talking to Thalmor agent Ondolemar in Markarth. In this quest, you will be tasked with trying to find evidence of Talos worship from a local citizen.
  
  
In the vanilla quest:
  

  
* Locate contraband
Turn in contraband (Quest complete)
  

  
Using Search and Seizure - Quest Expansion:
  

  
* Locate contraband (Optional)
Warn citizen and lie to the Thalmor (Quest complete)
  
* Warn citizen and report to the Thalmor (Quest complete)
Warn citizen and turn in contraband (Quest complete)
  
* Turn in contraband (Quest complete)

  
You now have multiple ways to approach this quest. Killing the NPCs will fail the quest, this is a vanilla behavior. Dialogue has been added where appropriate. This mod expands upon the concept of existing mods, such as [Search and Seizure for the Good Guys](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36693) by [Trey0405](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/53072196?tab=user+files) or [BUVARP SE RE - Barely Used Vanilla Actors Recycle Project Special Edition Revamped](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56120) by [AndrealphusVIII](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/5646623?tab=user+files). BUVARP in particular was my main inspiration when making this. No assets were used from BUVARP. The reason I didn't make this an expansion of BUVARP was because I wanted this to be available to a wider audience. A patch is available to prevent conflict with BUVARP.
