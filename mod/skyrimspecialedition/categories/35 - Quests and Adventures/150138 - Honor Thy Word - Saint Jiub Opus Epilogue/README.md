This is a small mod that allows you to bring Siant Jiub's Opus to the Bards College to be published. Fully voiced via spliced dialogue and ESl flagged.
  
  
  
By default Viarmo wont believe your crazy story about finding this in the Soul Cairn and think it's a forgery. But if you have a history of finding historic texts for him (AKA you've completed "Tending the flames.") He'll believe you and pay you for the book. I choose the Viarmo, because there's already a vanilla quest where a author sends his book to the bards college to be published. So he seemed like the obvious choice to distribute the book far and wide.
  
  
  
After you give it to Viarmo. Several copies a reprinted version will be enabled through out the world in fitting locations.
