This is my first mod! I was inspired by [Sensible Quest Prerequisites](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/121948), which makes Rise in the East a prerequisite for starting Wyrmstooth. But wait—I'm not sure I've *ever* played Rise in the East. And why would I? The only way to find it is to wander into the empty East Empire Company office on the Windhelm docks, which is easy to miss since it's next door to the locked Shatter-Shield office. You might get directed there by a guard outside the warehouse in Solitude, but to do that you have to talk to the guard which a lot of people won't think to try. This quest is so overlooked, there's even a typo in the quest objective the guard's dialogue gives you, and even the USSEP team never noticed it.
  
  
**What does this mod do?**
  
  
Sometime after completing one of several other quests, if you haven't been alerted to the East Empire Company's predicament yet you'll be sent a mysterious letter from someone in their organization. The contents of the letter will differ depending on which quest got the Company's attention, but it will direct you to seek out Orthus Endario at the Windhelm office.
  
  
**Scoundrel's Folly:** Tearing through the EEC's warehouse chasing after Gulum-Ei was bound to ruffle some feathers, but not to worry! The Company is more than willing to overlook this misstep because you've proven you can get this sort of job done.
  
  
**Destroy the Dark Brotherhood:** You just wiped out the most feared assassins in the world and threw in your lot with the Penitus Oculatus. What are you gonna do next? Get invited to take down some dirty pirates, that's what.
  
  
**The Raid:** Riften's skooma problem was bad for business, and your solving it was good for business. You're just the person the Company is looking for!
  
  
**How does it work?**
  
  
After you complete one of the above quests and level up, you'll get the letter. Reading it engages the same miscellaneous quest as the guard dialogue from the warehouse, sending you to meet Orthus.
  
  
**Bonus fix!**
  
  
The typo in the miscellaneous quest objective to go meet "Orthas" was driving me frelling crazy, so I gave it a quick little override using [Dynamic String Distributor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/107676). You don't need DSD to use this mod, but when you see that typo you'll kick yourself for not installing it. Don't say I didn't warn you.
  
  
**FAQ**
  
  
**Q:** ESP-FE?
  
**A:** Of course!
  
  
**Q:** Compatibility?
  
**A:** Probably everything. I made sure to edit no vanilla records, not even the one with the egregious typo.
  
  
**Q:** Does it work with VR?
  
**A:** No idea. Try it and let me know.
  
  
**Q:** Help! I did one of the above quests but I didn't get a letter!
  
**A:** After your next level-up a courier should be dispatched.
  
  
**Q:** Will you add \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ as another optional prerequisite?**A**: Maybe. I tried to choose quests that would get the EEC's attention that players are also likely to do. Destroying the Dark Brotherhood won't be everyone's choice, but everyone does the Thieves' Guild quests and helps out the jarl of Riften with their skooma problem, right?
  
  
**Q:** What about stealing the EEC shipping map during The Litany of Larceny?
  
**A:** I thought of that, but it was a lot harder to make a single quest objective a pre-condition than completing a quest.
  
  
**Q:** Any plans to upgrade the letter to an actual NPC with dialogue?
  
**A:** That would be fun! I'm still too new to modding, but maybe in the future.
