**A Conversation**

**Introduction:**
  
A Conversation is rather different from many of my other mods. It's a very short quest mod that I thought of and wrote up the same evening, it's completely written from the heart and features some of my best writing. It all revolves around one encounter with a stranger. Your conversation will delve into a more philosophical realm than what is spoken of in the vanilla game. Within this encounter, he will discuss his beliefs about life and his perceived way of living it, while imploring the player to do the same.
  
  
**Features****:**
  

  
* **Introspective ideas.** While not featuring the larger and more interactive aspects of my other quests, I believe this mod delivers in a very different way. I wrote the script in one go, and am incredibly happy with what I made. I believe my writing and the excellent voice acting will deliver a thought-provoking and introspective experience onto the player.

  
* **Fully voiced.**[size=2]The voice acting in this mod is done by [D. D. Rumin](https://www.ddrumin.com/ D. D. Rumin), an outstanding VA. He clearly had a passion and interest in the idea, and that is clearly within the voicing of the mod, and should help to build the mystique and intrigue of this quest. [/size]
