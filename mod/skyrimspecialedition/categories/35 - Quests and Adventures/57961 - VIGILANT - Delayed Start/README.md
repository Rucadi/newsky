[VIGILANT](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11849/?) is a large quest mod in which you join the Vigil of Stendarr and hunt down the Daedra, witches, and vampires wreaking havoc across Skyrim until a certain Daedric Prince takes a very personal interest in your actions. 
  
  
It's an excellent mod, however, there is a problem ... it's possible to start it at level 1. While the first few quests may be doable by a low-level character, the enemies will soon start wiping the floor with you if you aren't prepared. Another issue is that the quest giver who starts the questline will interrupt Erandur's scene in the Windpeak Inn if the mod is installed from the beginning.
  
  
This patch will delay the questline from starting until certain conditions are met - Altano and Orlando will now not be present in the Dawnstar's inn from the beginning of the game.
  
  
**This patch requires a new game to work! If you already had VIGILANT installed before adding this patch, it will do exactly nothing for you. No way around this, I'm afraid.**

Until I learn how to make an MCM menu, there will be several different plugins to choose from, ranging from the simple level requirements to more complicated requirements like having finished certain quests beforehand (more to come in the future updates).
  
  
**All plugins are ESL flagged and will not contribute towards your load order!**

 
  
  
**LEVEL REQUIREMENTS**
  
These patches are the simplest starting requirement for Vigilant - you must only reach the required level.
  
  
**Level 25:**
  
Altano and Orlando will appear in the Windpeak Inn in Dawnstar once you reach level 25.
  
  
**Level 30:**
  
Altano and Orlando will appear in the Windpeak Inn in Dawnstar once you reach level 30.
  
  
**Level 40:**
  
Altano and Orlando will appear in the Windpeak Inn in Dawnstar once you reach level 40.
  
  
**QUEST REQUIREMENTS**
  
These patches are more complicated than the ones above and will require you to be both at least level 25 (because there needs to be a minimum level - this is not a mod to start unprepared) and finish certain quests before starting Vigilant.
  
  
**Option 1:**
  
- be level 25+
  
- finish House of Horrors 
  
  
**Option 2:**
  
- be level 25+
  
- finish House of Horrors 
  
- finish Kindred Judgement (finale of Dawnguard DLC main questline - side does not matter)
  
  
**Option 3:**
  
- be level 25+
  
- finish House of Horrors 
  
- finish Kindred Judgement (finale of Dawnguard DLC main questline - side does not matter)

**Option 4:**
  
- be level 25+
  
- finish House of Horrors

- finish House of Horrors 
  
- finish Kindred Judgement (finale of Dawnguard DLC main questline - side does not matter)
  
- finish Unholy Vigil (requires Vigil Enforcer CC)
  
- finish The Consequences (requires The Cause CC)
  
  
**Option 6:** 
  
- be level 25+
  
- finish Censored Fate (requires DAc0da - ending does not matter)
  
  
**Option 7:**
  
- be level 25+
  
- finish House of Horrors
  
- finish Censored Fate (requires DAc0da - ending does not matter)
  
  
**Option 8:**
  
- be level 25+
  
- finish House of Horrors
  
- finish Kindred Judgement (finale of Dawnguard DLC main questline - side does not matter)
  
- finish Censored Fate (requires DAc0da - ending does not matter)
  
  
**Option 9:**
  
- be level 25+
  
- finish House of Horrors
  
- finish Kindred Judgement (finale of Dawnguard DLC main questline - side does not matter)

**NOTES ON QUEST REQUIREMENTS (SPOILERS):**
  
Spoiler
  

  
* level 25 is one I found to be the sweet spot to start Vigilant at absolute earliest; anything lower and you may have issues ... but a lot obviously depends on your modded setup (I'd still recommend somewhere around level 40, as Vigilant is meant to be an endgame mod, especially act 4)
House of Horrors was chosen because it involves a Daedric Prince heavily involved with Vigilant's questline, though that's hardly a secret - if you have a mod overhauling this quest like [the one by jayserpa](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57285)﻿, you'll be fine; it only matters that the quest is completed in your journal
  
* Kindred Judgement is the finale of Danwguard's main questline, and the same Daedric Prince as above is technically the bigger bad behind all the conflict event though he himself never appears (but his influence is felt constantly)
Unholy Vigil fits nicely into the mod's narrative, as it once again deals with the influence of the same Daedric Prince and even takes place in the same town where the mod later starts 
  
* as for The Consequences, it is the resolution of the Cause CC, it involves the Vigilants and it may just give you some incentive to join their cause (heh) ... as well as pave some ground for the overarching plot of Vicn's entire trilogy (Dragonborn/Prisoner is very important)
while this is not a hard requirement (yet), it's also warmly recommended that your character is the Dragonborn - for their mythic importance, if nothing else
  
* a note on level req and The Cause CC: level 25 requirement is technically obsolete with the patch that also requires The Cause, since that one only starts once you reach level 46 (which is a bit stupidly high) - but it's there just in case you lowered its starting req
DAc0da is officially a prequel to Vigilant, Glenmoril and Unslaad - you'll be outright directed to Altano at one point
  
  
  
**ADJUSTING LEVEL REQUIREMENTS**
  
If you are not happy with any of the offered starting level options, you can easily adjust that part of the patch to your own taste. To do so, do the following:
  
Spoiler
  

  
* open Vigilant - Delayed Start.esp in xEdit and expand it
expand Global section
  
* click on entry zzzVigilantMinLevel
change entry Value to whatever level you want the mod to be available to start at (e.g. 10, if you're very brave)
  
* see this image if you need help:
