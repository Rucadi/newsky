ARL BALGRUUF DILEMMA[/size][/font][/size][/font][/size] SSE[/size][/size][/color][/font][/size][/font][/size][font=Trebuchet MS][size=4]Fully voiced (spliced) new dialogue during *Message To Whiterun* civil war pivotal quest.
  
  
(1) You can convince Jarl Balgruuf to join Stormcloaks (compatible with [Open Civil War](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11076)).
  
  
*How to start convincing:
  
  - if you are done with Dragonstone retrieval, ask Balgruuf to give response to Ulfric, then interrupt Balgruuf during the scene when he discuss it with his advisors ([size=3]"Proventus, what do you make of all this? If Ulfric were to attack Whiterun...")*
  
  - if not, have Balgruuf and Farengar tell you about it, then talk to Balgruuf when he's back on his throne, select the new dialogue option ("Is it that you haven't made up your mind yet?")
  
  
(2) You can do civil war without main quest (\*), and you will be able to do main quest later (no part of it is removed).
  
  
(\*) however, on Stormcloak side, you have to convince Jarl Balgruuf to join Stormcloaks before he stops asking you to help Farengar with some dragon research
  
  
*CAVEAT: if you talk to Hrongar before doing (1) you can give him the idea that he should be the stormcloak-aligned jarl of Whiterun. Avoid it, for in this case Balgruuf will keep asking you to complete the dragon related task.*

**Explanation:** In quest Dragon Rising there are recorded lines for Balgruuf/Irileth government only. Neither Vignar nor Hrongar have corresponding dialogue lines.
