**The Price of Art**

**﻿Warning!
  
[size=2]SpoilerWhile many of my mods touch upon dark topics, this mod goes into some detail about the topic of child abuse. While only briefly described, this may cause some players to be uncomfortable, and so I thought I'd add a little warning here.
  
  
As an aside, this mod isn't meant to be edgy or anything along those lines, just delve into some somber topics that are never touched upon in Skyrim in a tasteful manner, thanks :))**
  
[/size]**Introduction:**

  
* The Price of Art is a quest mod inspired by the story and life of Vincent Van Gogh. The mod features a travelling poet named Gaius, who seeks to heal the damage that he has sustained in the past. He will travel all over Skyrim in an encounter-based format, with each encounter you'll learn more about his incredibly interesting but tragic life.

  
**Features****:**
  

  
* **Fully voiced.**The mod features extremely high-quality voice acting done by [D. D. Rumin](https://www.ddrumin.com/ D. D. Rumin), an incredibly talented individual who did an amazing job bringing Gaius to life. The mod has 148 lines all done to a high standard.
    
  ﻿﻿﻿
**Unique questline.** The Price of Art is a tragic story exploring themes not touched upon anywhere in Skyrim. The player will slowly learn of the torment Gaius has experienced through his life. While dark and tragic, Gaius is an accurate representation of what these morbid events may manifest into.
  
  

**Showcase:**
  
  
**FAQ:**Can the mod be downloaded mid-game?
  

  
* **Yes, it's completely fine to install mid-game.**

Is it ESLed?
  

  
* **It is, thanks to CharderoTheLupe!**

Is the mod clean?
  

  
* **Yes, I have only edited the necessary cells, there should be no conflicts due to dirty edits.**

How do I start the quest?
  

  
* **You need to visit the Shrine of Azura to meet Gaius for the first time.**

He's just sitting there after I said goodbye, is that normal?
  

  
* **Yep! Just wait a few hours and he'll move on.**

Can it be ported to Xbox?
  

  
* **The original porter who would do all of my mods can no longer do it. If you're up to it and agree to give credit along with including my showcases on the page, I have no problems with you porting it.**
