This is a simple mod, to let you tell Eltrys that no, seriously, the note isn't yours and you want nothing to do with it. Someone just died because of this ten feet from you, and you have better things to get killed over.
  
Eltrys will offer to pay you, because this is important to him. You can extort him if you're a terrible person, or you can insist that no, seriously, you don't want the note, at which point he'll take it back, and the Forsworn Conspiracy quest will stop, while the actual conspiracy continues unabated behind closed doors - not that you care, of course. That's all Somebody Else's Problem.
