**DESCRIPTION**
  
  
As I was recently setting out to do the Flight or Fight quest you get from Grosta at Heartwood Mill, I suddenly felt sorry for poor Leifnarr. By all accounts he seems to have been a decent guy, just a dad trying to provide for his wife and son, and yet he ends up dead in a nasty bandit cave, and not even you the Dragonborn can save him...
  
  
...well, now you can!
  
  
This little mod allows you to find the missing Leifnarr alive and bring him back to Heartwood Mill, where he will resume his daily life. If you stick around, you'll see him interact with his wife and kid, all fully voiced with carefully spliced vanilla voice lines.
  
  
  
**FEATURES**
  
  

  
* New dialogues and new scenes between Grosta, Gralnach, and Leifnarr
Existing dialogues and scenes edited to reflect the fact that Leifnarr survives
  
* Flagged as ESL, won't take a slot in your load order
Poor Leifnarr has been doomed to a sad death since 2011, don't you want to go and save him for once?
  

  
  
**HOW TO START**
  
  
Same as in vanilla - either talk to Grosta at Heartwood Mill, or go and find Leifnarr yourself.
  
  
  
**COMPATIBILITY NOTES**
  
  
Compatible with Special Edition and Anniversary Edition. Compatible with USSEP but does not require USSEP to work.
