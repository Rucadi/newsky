[line]*“Determined to use the divine powers of the Heart of Lorkhan to create a new god for the exclusive benefit of the Dwemer, Lord Kagrenac forged three great enchanted artifacts, which are called "Kagrenac's Tools." Wraithguard is an enchanted gauntlet to protect its wearer from destruction when tapping the heart's power. Sunder is an enchanted hammer to strike the heart and produce the exact volume and quality of power desired. Keening is an enchanted blade that is used to flay and focuses the power that rises from the heart. When Kagrenac used these tools on the heart in the Battle of Red Mountain, no one knows what happened, but the Dwemer race disappeared entirely from the mortal world..”*

If you ever played Morrowind, then you know Keening, Sunder and Wraithguard and how incredibly powerful these artifacts were.
  
If in Skyrim you joined the College of Winterhold, you probably were thrilled to see Keening make a return at the end of the [Arniel’s Endeavor](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Arniel's_Endeavor) questline.
  
But why is Keening so weak compared to its version in Morrowind? And where are Sunder and Wraithguard, and what happened to them?
  
This mod reintroduces the rest of Kagrenac’s Tools to Skyrim and unlocks their full potential!
  
  
Go on a quest to obtain these incredibly powerful artifacts in Skyrim!

You start this quest by first obtaining Keening. To do this, you’ll have to join the College of Winterhold and finish the side questline [Arniel’s Endeavor](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Arniel%27s_Endeavor). You’ll also need to have finished [The Way of the Voice](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Way_of_the_Voice)﻿﻿ in the main questline.
  
A couple of days after you completed Arniel’s Endeavor and claimed Keening, you will receive a letter from the courier, and the quest will kick-off.
  
  
Make sure you have Keening in your inventory, it will turn into a quest item when the mod starts! If this doesn't happen, try dropping and picking up Keening, and then leaving that location. When Keening becomes a quest object and can't be dropped you know the quest has started properly!
  
  
An alternate start has been introduced via the MCM menu, which will allow the player to bypass the necessary requirements to start the mod. Simply toggle the Alternate Start Check via the MCM and the mod will immediately start. (E.g. picking up any item will start the mod.)

The easiest way to install (and this is recommended) is to download using the NMM or a similar mod manager. It can do the downloading and activate it for you.
  
If, for some reason, you want or need to do a manual install, just download and extract the content of the .7zip to your Skyrim/Data folder (choose to overwrite if asked).
  
All that's left to do is activate the .esp and start the game!

**The courier doesn't appear!**
  
Make sure you meet all the quest requirements as detailed above in the Quest Start section! 
  
Also, be very sure that you have Keening in your inventory, it will turn into a quest item when the mod starts! 
  
If this doesn't happen, try dropping and picking up Keening, and then leaving that location. When Keening becomes a quest object and can't be dropped you know the quest has started properly! Another solution is to restart the game and try dropping and picking up Keening again and then leaving that location.
  
  
  
**Where is the ring in the Arcanaeum?**
  
﻿Answer: The ring will randomly spawn in one of five different locations around the Arcanaeum.
  

  
* The first location to search is in Urag gro-Shub's desk.
The second location can be on the right side table in the center of the Arcanaeum.
  
* The third spot is on the far right side under a pile of books.
The fourth spot is on the far left side inside a cup on the table closest to Urag gro-Shub's desk.
  
* The last area to search is near the entrance to the Arcanaeum underneath a bench.
  
If you don't find the ring there, see if you have any mods that modify the Arcanaeum and in particular that area.
  
Try moving ToK down your load order or deactivating the other mods. We also have a compatibility patch for Immersive College of Winterhold that you can download in the optional files.
  
  
  
**How do I solve the Sunder Vault puzzle?**Here are a few hints to help you. Try using only 1 or 2 hints and see if that gets you on the right path. Hint 5 contains the full answer.**Hint #1**: Find the book at the end of the walkway by the three receptacles. There's a note inside. First, read the journal to start the miscellaneous quest, then read the note after you have placed the three Stanzas on the receptacles.
  
**Hint #2**: The titles in the note correspond with the numbers 1, 13, and 29. These are not the numbers needed to unlock Sunder, but what do they mean? And what do the numbers behind each title mean?
  
**Hint #3**: At the entrance to the Vault, you'll find multiple volumes of the Sermons of Vivec. What are the numbers of these volumes?
  
**Hint #4**Find numbers 1, 13, and 29 of the Sermons. Then look for the 349th word in the 1st Sermon, the 129th word in the 13th Sermon, and the 56th Word in the 29th Sermon.
  
**Hint #5**: You can obtain Sunder with the following combination: 348
  
  
**Is there a way to bypass the College of Winterhold to start the mod?**Most certainly! An alternate start has been introduced via the MCM menu. SkyUI/MCM automatic support; no patches required.
  
  
**Does (Mod X) conflict with ToK?**
  
ToK should only have a conflict with mods that edit Keening and the same locations.
  
  
  
**Will you create a patch for (Mod X)?**
  
It depends on how complex that patch would be. So.. maybe?
  
  
  
**Can I translate ToK to another language?**
  
Sure! Please share your translation with us, so we add it to the page, and more people can find it.
  
  
  
**Can I use assets from your mod for my mod project?**
  
It depends on the asset since we did not make everything in this mod.
