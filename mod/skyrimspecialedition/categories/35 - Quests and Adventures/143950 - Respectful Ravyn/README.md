**Respectful Ravyn**

Ravyn Imyan of the Thieves Guild was once a member of the Morag Tong. He tells you as such! Not only does he tell you this, but he also tells you that the Morag Tong are the enemy of the Dark Brotherhood. If you're a member of the Brotherhood, there is no option to tell him this. In addition, he's also very rude to you - even if you're the Guild Master. That is, until now...
  
  
Force Ravyn to improve his attitude towards you. You can do so by threatening to turn him over to the Brotherhood, using your authority as Guild Master, or if you're a member of the Brotherhood - threaten him yourself or even kill him in Sithis' name!

  
  
**Features**
  
  

  
* Fully voiced dialogue using existing lines in the game, integrated seamlessly into vanilla Skyrim.
Multiple paths to force Ravyn to change his attitude towards you.
  

  
**How to start Respectful Ravyn**
