**[size=4]Adventurer's Start - An Alternate Perspective Addon**[/size]
  
This mod adds a few new alternate beginnings for Alternate Perspectives. A lot of these put you right into action so make sure you are ready! Most starts don't give you anything extra or remove anything from the player, so choose in the starting room what you think you should have for this start! Any starts that give you something in addition will be noted below!
  
  
**Roadside Ambush**
  
This start places you on the road being ambushed by 3 level 1 bandits. The possible locations available are as followed: Spoiler

  
* Bruma (With Bruma Addon. North of Bruma Eastern Watchtower)
Eastmarch (Close to Fort Amol)
  
* Haafingar (North of Solitude)
Hjaalmarch (Between Dragon Bridge and Robber's Gorge)
  
* Falkreath (South of Lake Ilinalta close to Shriekwind)
The Pale (By Windward Ruins)
  
* The Reach (Close to the bridge to Karthspire)
The Rift (Close to Sarethi Farm)
  
* Whiterun (North of North Brittleshin Pass and close to Unmarked Pillar Puzzle)
  
  
**Fell in a Spike Pit**
  
You've fallen into the spike pit at Halted Stream Camp. This places you in the pit next to the spikes at half health. Nearby you there is a dead mercenary with some loot you can use to help you.
  
  
**Bounty Hunter**
  
This start places you at one of the bandit camps in Skyrim. You get a side quest similar to the bounty quests in the base game, and have to turn in the bounty in the hold that you chose. This start gives you a few healing, stamina, and magicka potions as you are fighting a bandit camp at level one. The items can be customized by editing a leveled list that gets given to the player at the start of the quest. The possible locations available are as followed: Spoiler

  
* Bruma (With Bruma Addon. Plundered Mine)
Eastmarch (Stony Creek Cave)
  
* Falkreath (Bannermist Tower)
Haafingar (Ironback Hideout)
  
* Hjaalmarch (Orothiem)
The Rift (Broken Helm Hollow)
  
* Whiterun (Redoran's Retreat)
Winterhold (Snowpoint Beacon)
  
  
  
**Bandit Prisoner**
  
This start places you in a cell in one of the Bandit controlled Forts. Bandits will leave you alone as long as you are in your cell, but as soon as you leave... You can find some lockpicks somewhere in the cell for you to try to make your escape. All the locks are apprentice so it shouldn't be too difficult to escape. The possible locations available are as followed: Spoiler
  

  
* Haafingar (Fort Hraggstad)
The Pale (Fort Dunstad)
  
* The Reach (Fort Sungard)
The Rift (Fort Greenwall)
  
* Whiterun (Fort Greymoor)
  
  
**Orc Stronghold**
  
You start at one of the Orc Strongholds, where you were raised. You will start as Blood-Kin if you choose this start. Possible Locations: Spoiler
  

  
* Dushnikh Yal
Mor Khazgur
  
* Narzulbur

  
I did not do Largashbur since that stronghold involves a daedric quest.
  
  
**Saved by Vigilants**
  
This start puts you in a cell in Hob's Fall Cave, next up to be sacrificed by necromancers. Luckily for you, Vigilants are here to save the day.
  
  
  
**Out in the Wilderness**
  
Puts you out in the wild away from cities and towns. Perfect for survival focused playthroughs. You can optionally change a global variable to make the start remove all of your items and equip you with beggar's clothes (or whatever items you want by editing the formlist and leveled list).
  
Has a location variant for every hold and with Bruma with Bruma addon.
  
Information on how to customize and the possible locations: Spoiler
  

  
* Bruma - Northish of Greenwood
Eastmarch - South East of Kynesgrove
  
* Falkreath - North of Twilight Sepulcher
Haafingar - Southwest of Northwatch Keep
  
* Hjaalmarch - North of Abandoned Shack
The Pale - West of Windward Ruins
  
* The Reach - East of Dushnikh Yal
The Rift - West of Boulderfall Cave
  
* Whiterun - South of Rannveig's Fast
Winterhold - By Bleakcoast Cave
  

You can enable the removal of all items by changing a global variable. Set MissileAPWildernessRemoveItems to 1 to enable it. It will also give the player the items in the MissileAPWildernessItems leveled list and equip the items in the MissileAPWildernessClothing formlist.
  
  
  
  
  
**FAQ:**
  
*Will you add more starts?*
  
I want to add some more starts at some point in the future, but nothing planned a this moment. I think I will probably want to make more starts like the Saved by Vigilants start instead of the ones that have a lot of possible locations (Like bounty hunter, ambush, and wilderness). Making the Vigilant start was a lot of fun.
  
  
*Can you make X start?*
  
Unlikely I will take requests, but if I like the idea enough I may consider it.
  
  
*Is this ESL Flagged?*
  
Yes. If i see one comment asking I will crash out.
  
  
*Can you twerk it live on stream?*
  
What??? Again, no........
  
  
**Compatibility:**
  
[JJerem](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/125077838)'s Orc Strongholds - **Compatible**
  
[snozz2004](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/4029188)'s Overhauls that touch the same areas I touch - **Compatible**
  
Other Alternate Perspective Addons - **Compatible** for the most part. If they somehow touch the exact same objects I touch (HIGHLY unlikely) then they will have minor issues. The ones below in Recommendations are all **Compatible**.
  
[Inconvenient Dungeons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66784) - **Compatible with small patch.** Disables a spike added in the halted stream pit during the quest so the player doesn't die instantly
  
[Headhunter - Bounties Redone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51847) - **Compatible**. The Bounty Hunter starts just won't have the head cutting mechanic. I may work on integrating it in the future.
  
  
Location overhauls - **Depends**. I touch like 10 vanilla objects. Good chance they will be compatible. If they touch the same records there could be incompatibility. Easy to check in xEdit though.
  
  
Alternate Start Live Another Life - **Incompatible** for obvious reasons.
  
Other Alt Start mods - **Incompatible**
  
  
**Requirements:**
  
[Alternate Perspective - Alternate Start](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50307)
  
  
[Beyond Skyrim - Bruma](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10917)
  
Only needed if you want the Bruma Starts addon!
  
  
**Recommendations:**
  
[Abandoned Prison Start - An Alternate Perspective Addon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/142862)
  
Adds a start in the abandoned prison.
  
  
[I Used to Be a Dungeon Boss like You - An Alternate Perspective or Alternate Start Addon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55310) 
  
Really unique and fun start!
  
  
[New Beginnings - Alternate Perspective Extension](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57818)
  
Even more starts!
  
  
[Start in Bruma (an addon for Alternate Perspective)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/100522)
  
Another Bruma start addon!
  
  
[Forgemaster's Fingers Quest for Orcs and Blood-Kin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/145145)
  
A good mod for the Orc Stronghold start. Lets you talk to the chief to start the Forgemaster's Finger quest since you are already Blood-Kin. A good first adventure for people raised in the Strongholds to do!
  
  
[snozz2004](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/4029188)'s Locations: Specifically [Bannermist](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/75262), [Fort Dunstad](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/144471), [Fort Greymoor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/112771), [Halted Stream](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/132119), [Redoran's Retreat](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80226), and [Snowpoint](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/146533)
  
Improves some of the areas my starts take place in!
