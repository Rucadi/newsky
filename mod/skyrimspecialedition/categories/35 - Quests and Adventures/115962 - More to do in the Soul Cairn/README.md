> *"You stand within the precincts of the Soul Cairn, an otherworldly refuge dedicated to peace, love, eternal rest and harmony." - Ideal Master (An Elder Scrolls Legend: Battlespire)*

The Soul Cairn is a mysterious realm, controlled by crystal-like beings called **the Ideal Masters**. Many souls end up roaming endlessly in its dark plains, and nothing can save them from their endless sufferings. Some might want to flee, but if they try, the Soul Cairn's masters will punish them and transform them into mindless skeletons to protect their paradise.
  
  
Amongst the souls, **Glendora Messenia and Gavo Antonius cling on their knowledge to flee, but they will need your help**. On the other hand, **Angarion the Bold has arrived in the Soul Cairn** and needs your help to retrieve his lost memories. Will you accompany them on their last voyage in the Soul Cairn?
  
  
This mod contains an updated and revoiced version of the mod [Grief](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97832). **Therefore, you cannot have both in your Skyrim, or they will conflict.**

* Where are the quests and how do I start them?

Check out the images, you'll find a map showing where you can find the 3 new NPCs. Talk to them, and the quests will start.
  
  

* Is this mod voiced?

Yes, it is!
  
  

* Why did you rework Grief? What changed?

Grief was supposed to be released as part of this bigger mod, but was rushed and published beforehand, due to my sudden participation to a Skyrim Mod Jam. This version's story is exactly the same, expect this time it is properly voice-acted by a real voice-actor, and not by me.
  
  

* Where is the Chapel of Love?

That is the whole point of the quest. Where is the Chapel of Love? Roam next to the "limits" of the map on the northern and western parts of the Soul Cairn and you'll stumble on it.
