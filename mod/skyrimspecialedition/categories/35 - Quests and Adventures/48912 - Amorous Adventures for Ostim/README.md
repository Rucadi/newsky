**It is better to read the [OStim Help Center (Tutorial and AE Files including OBody)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61685) before you use the mod.**
  
  
This is the beta version of Amorous Adventures for Ostim. If you are using the Amorous Adventures clean osex or Amorous Adventures clean, you could move to this version directly.
  
  
I transformed the [Amorous Adventures clean osex](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48587) from Skyrim LE but it lack of many scene animations because of limit of the [Osex](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17209).
  
So I port the [Amorous Adventures Clean SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7305) to [OStim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40725) by myself.
  
Compared with the converted version, I replace the osex API with the ostim API and add some scenes that the Osex version don't have.
  
~~However, there are some scenes I can't port yet because the lack of animations.~~ Now, the animations are basically complete.If you are interested in the conversion of animation, Please refer to [OStim Animation Porting Guide](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42347)﻿.
  
  
TIPS:
  
- I only added the scenes animation. if there are any problem about the scene animation, you can tell me and I will try to solve them.
  
- I didn't modify the Quests. If there are any problem about the Quests and plots(may be old bug), not my problem.
  
- Porting work is still in progress with the ostim's development. If you have any ideas about this mod you can Communicate in [discord.gg/RECvhVaRcU](https://discord.gg/RECvhVaRcU)
