# Dungeon Quests are not Miscellaneous

[Dungeon Quests](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dungeon_Quests) are an inconsistent mix of [Miscellaneous Objectives](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Miscellaneous_Quests) and [Side Quests](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Side_Quests), with some short quests like Repentance having a full journal entry of their own, and some long quests like the Legend of Red Eagle only popping up through the Miscellaneous section. This mod adds separate journal entries and quest logs to most miscellaneous Dungeon Quests by converting them into full Side Quests.
  
  
Titles for these quests are taken from either their existing (but unused) official in-game title, their title in the Prima Guide, or in a few cases, titles I invented myself.
  
  
Features
  
  

  
* Adds full journal entries and quest logs for the following Dungeon Quests:[list]
Angarvunde: [The Treasure of Angarvunde](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Angarvunde_(quest))﻿
  
* Ansilvund: [A Love Beyond Death](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ansilvund_(quest))﻿
Blind Cliff Bastion: [The Affairs of Hagravens](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Affairs_of_Hagravens)﻿
  
* Frostflow Lighthouse: [What Lies Beneath](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Frostflow_Abyss)﻿
Mistwatch: [Forgetting About Fjola](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Mistwatch_(quest))﻿
  
* Ragnvald: [The Secrets of Ragnvald](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ragnvald_(quest))
Rebel's Cairn: [The Legend of Red Eagle](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Rebel%27s_Cairn_(quest))﻿
  

  
[\*]All quests now contribute to [Sideways](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Sideways)﻿ (if you have an Achievement enabler), and the **Side Quests Completed** counter.
  
[/list]
  
**Exceptions**I have not included a few quests which function more as [Favors](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Favors) (a couple of which are instead covered by [Miscellaneous Quests are Favors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/121610)), or some dungeon activities which are technically "quests" but had no objectives in the first place.
  
  
Compatibility
  
  
This mod edits numerous scripts and quest fragments, including those for all of the above quests and/or associated dialogue, and will not be compatible with anything else that edits those scripts. Check for *loose file overwrite* conflicts.
  

  
* **Compatible** with [Miscellaneous Quests are Favors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/121610).
**Load After** any files from USSEP.
  

  
If you're also running [The Choice is Yours](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3850) - if you want the Frostflow Lighthouse quest to have a full journal entry, per the design of my mod, load my mod after that one. If you want the Frostflow Lighthouse quest to have no objectives at all, per the design of that mod, load that mod after mine.
