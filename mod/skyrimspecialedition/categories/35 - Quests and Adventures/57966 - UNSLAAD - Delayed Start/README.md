After the trials of VIGILANT and the darkness of GLENMORIL, [UNSLAAD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11789)﻿ brings a much-needed catharsis. Here you will face the final threat, perhaps reach the Dragon and build a new Dream ... and maybe even understand Love. This cold, dark and very gentle place may yet become a goodly home for you.
  
  
Unlike the other two entries in the trilogy, UNSLAAD does not start with someone walking up to you or seeing a scene play out - it's started by finding and touching a doll in the High Hrothgar courtyard. However, this doll is present there since the beginning of the game and if you're too curious about it, you will accidentally start the questline long before you may want to do so.
  
  
This patch will disable the Half-Dragon Doll until certain conditions are met.
  
  
**This patch requires a new game to work! If you already had UNSLAAD installed before adding this patch, it will do exactly nothing for you. No way around this, I'm afraid.**

Until I learn how to make an MCM menu, there will be several different plugins to choose from, ranging from the simple level requirements to more complicated requirements like having finished certain quests beforehand (more to come in the future updates).
  
  
**All plugins are ESL flagged and will not contribute towards your load order!**

**LEVEL REQUIREMENTS**
  
These patches are the simplest starting requirement for Glenmoril - you must only reach the required level.
  
  
**Level 25:**
  
Half-Dragon Doll will appear on the ledge behind the High Hrothgar courtyard gates (where you learn the Whirlwind Sprint shout) once you reach level 25.
  
  
**Level 30:**
  
Half-Dragon Doll will appear on the ledge behind the High Hrothgar courtyard gates (where you learn the Whirlwind Sprint shout) once you reach level 30.
  
  
**Level 40:**
  
Half-Dragon Doll will appear on the ledge behind the High Hrothgar courtyard gates (where you learn the Whirlwind Sprint shout) once you reach level 40.
  
  
**QUEST REQUIREMENTS**
  
These patches are more complicated than the ones above and will require you to be both at least level 25 (because there needs to be a minimum level - this is not a mod to start unprepared) and finish certain quests before starting Unslaad.
  
  
**Option 1:**
  
- be level 25+
  
- finish Dragonslayer (finale of Skyrim's main quest)
  
  
**Option 2:**
  
- be level 25+
  
- finish Dragonslayer (finale of Skyrim's main quest)
  
- finish Act 4 of Vigilant (requires Vigilant mod - ending does not matter)
  
  
**Option 3:**
  
- be level 25+
  
- finish Dragonslayer (finale of Skyrim's main quest)
  
- finish Act 4 of Vigilant (requires Vigilant mod - ending does not matter, but true ending is recommended)
  
- finish Sacred Anatomancer (requires Vigilant mod - "divine the future" path is recommended, but any path will do as long as the quest is completed in your journal)
  
  
**Option 4:**
  
- be level 25+
  
- finish Dragonslayer (finale of Skyrim's main quest)
  
- finish Censored Fate (requires Dac0da mod - ending does not matter)
  
- finish Act 4 of Vigilant (requires Vigilant mod - ending does not matter, but true ending is recommended)
  
- finish Sacred Anatomancer (requires Vigilant mod - "divine the future" path is recommended, but any path will do as long as the quest is completed in your journal)
  
  
**Option 5 (recommended for best story integration):**
  
- be level 25+
  
- finish Dragonslayer (finale of Skyrim's main quest)
  
- finish Censored Fate (requires Dac0da mod - ending does not matter, but finishing the mod's eastern branch is recommended along with telling a character you've been helping out to become a star at its conclusion)
  
- finish Act 4 of Vigilant (requires Vigilant mod - ending does not matter, but true ending is recommended)
  
- finish Sacred Anatomancer (requires Vigilant mod - "divine the future" path is recommended, but any path will do as long as the quest is completed in your journal)
  
- finish Feast of Love (requires Glenmoril mod - this is NOT an ending quest yet, but it's close enough that it makes a good jumping off point)
  
  
**NOTES ON QUEST REQUIREMENTS (SPOILERS):**
  
Spoiler
  

  
* level 25 is one I found to be the sweet spot to start Unslaad at absolute earliest; anything lower and you may have issues ... but a lot obviously depends on your modded setup (I'd still recommend a bit higher level, since Unslaad is the resolution to the trilogy and therefore endgame mod)
I decided on Dragonslayer because Unslaad itself only makes sense if your character is the Dragonborn (before the most recent update you couldn't even finish the story otherwise) and once Alduin is gone
  
* Censored Fate is the concluding quest of Dac0da, which serves as a setup for the entire series (its eastern branch also directly foreshadows Unslaad)
Act 4 of Vigilant is important because it teaches you the importance of compassion - that, too, is a form of Love, little dragon
  
* Sacred Anatomancer is more a bridging quest between Vigilant and Glenmoril, but the "prophecy" path includes a hint for Unslaad - while this path is not required, it's recommended
Feast of Love is not quite the ending of Glenmoril yet, but it's the encounter with the final boss who gates the player from the endings, all the paths in act 4 lead to it, not to mention the boss' dialogue contains hints for Unslaad's true goal, all of which makes it a good jumping off point until the endings are available 
  
* Another note on general continuity: While Unslaad is the finale of Vicn's trilogy, concluding what started with Vigilant and continued in Glenmoril, it can also be considered an overall finale to the Dragonborn's story in Skyrim. Especially if you know your lore and accept what it hints at. For that reason, I recommend playing Unslaad as the dead last mod in your playthrough.
  
  
**ADJUSTING LEVEL REQUIREMENTS**
  
If you are not happy with any of the offered starting level options, you can easily adjust that part of the patch to your own taste. To do so, do the following:
  
Spoiler
  

  
* open Unslaad - Delayed Start.esp in xEdit and expand it
expand Global section
  
* click on entry zzzUnslaadMinLevel
change entry Value to whatever level you want the mod to be available to start at (e.g. 10, if you're very brave)
