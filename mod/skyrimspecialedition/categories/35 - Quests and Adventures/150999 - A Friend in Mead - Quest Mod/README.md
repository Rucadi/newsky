Introduction:**[/u][/size][/b]

  
* A Friend in Mead revolves around an Argonian courier travelling across all of Skyrim, Walks-Distant-Sands. As you encounter him at the various inns and taverns across Skyrim, you'll get to hear a wide range stories of the people he's met on the road. When prompted, the player will be able to speak of their own encounters with strange or humorous individuals, all dependant on the quests you've currently completed. With awareness for many of the stranger Daedric quests to commentary on some of my other mods, the player will have a total of 16 different responses to choose from, ensuring you're never forced to pick an option more than once.

* **Unique questline.** This quest is entirely unique in its presentation and execution. Walks-Distant-Sands is an encounter based NPC similar to my other mods but the opportunity to hear his stories and speak of your own tales is something I've never approached or seen done before. Featuring five unique conversations which branch from humouros stories of a fan favourite Khajiit, to stranger tales of the unknown. Combined with the opportunity to speak of the player's encounters, it should make for a unique and memorable quest.

  
* **Interesting NPC.** While the writing within this mod is not as serious as some of my other content, Walks-Distant-Sands is still an NPC I took great care to feel real and human. Being much more than a dispenser of humourous bar stories, you'll be able to learn of his past and the reasons for his current occupation along with his fondness for meeting new travellers.

  
* [size=2]**Integration into the world.** With Walks-Distant-Sands appearing in the various inns across Skyrim, I wanted to ensure that he felt properly integrated into the world and not just placed in there without any regard. To accomplish this, he'll not only comment on the player's stories, be them from my mods or from vanilla, he'll also speak to the other residents of the taverns. Featuring nine interactions with various innkeeps or tavern goers, he should feel like a believable character in each tavern he visits.[/size]

  
* [size=2]**Fully voiced.** This quest has been voiced by the incredible [size=2][size=2][Alex Cain](https://www.castingcall.club/complete-the-circuit). With over 300 lines of dialogue, he managed to nail every single line and I couldn't be happier with his performance![/size][/size][/size]
