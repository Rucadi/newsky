# Mehrunes Dagon's Shrine Unlocked - Pieces of the Past Alternate Ending
- Author: MadAborModding
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/119502


**Mod Overview**
  
This mod provides additional methods to enter Mehrunes Dagon's Shrine without helping Silus Vesuius or having to side with Mehrunes Dagon. Additionally, if a skilled enough smith, you can reforge the Razer yourself as an alternate way to end the "Pieces of the Past" quest. **40+ new lines of dialogue have been added.** All responses use re-purposed vanilla lines. No AI or splicing tools were utilized.
  
  
**Enter the Shrine - No Unnecessary Restrictions**
  

  
* The lock on the shrine's door has been changed to a master-level lock and can now be picked. (The key dropped by the Dremora still unlocks it as well.)
Silus Vesuius now carries an additional copy of the key to the shrine that is able to be pickpocketed or taken from his corpse.
  
* A journal has been added to Silus's House which explains how he came into position of the key and, furthermore, fleshes out his character.
After reading Silus's Journal, you can confront him directly and, if you pass a speech check, can obtain the key through dialogue.
  
* You can also attempt to convince Silus to close the museum. Depending on the prompt, Silus will become hostile to the player and can be killed without a bounty.

  
**Reforge the Razor Yourself - Alternate Ending**

  
* An optional plugin is available which allows the player to reforge Mehrunes' Razer themselves without Dagon's help.
**Adds 30 new lines** of dialogue all voiced with Vanilla assets. You can now convince Silus to let you reforge the Razor instead of going to Dagon. No one needs to die and the Razor can be obtained if the player is a master smith.
  
* The Razor can be crafted at any forge and requires all the fragments, three Daedra Hearts, and the Daedric & Arcane Blacksmith Perks.
Upon reforging the Razor this way, the "Pieces of the Past" quest will end/fail automatically.
  
* You can keep the reforged Razor or give it back to Silus for gold. If you keep it, Silus may try to take it back through force if you fail an intimidation check.
**If you don't want to help Silus, you can still get the Razor.**
  
* You can collect the pieces of Razor without agreeing to help Silus. This is actually vanilla behavior, not a change made by the mod. The pieces spawn into the world after Silus invites you into the museum. Acquire them and, if you are a skilled enough smith, just take them to a forge!
If you choose to go this route, additional dialogue options will be added to Silus.
  
* A copy of "The Keepers of the Razor" has been added to Silus's inventory as well—the same book he gives the player when they agree to help him. It lists the locations of the Razor pieces and can pickpocketed/taken from his corpse.
Additionally, If you did not agree to help Silus and have a copy of "The Keepers of the Razor" in your inventory, you can present the book to Jorgen and warn him that he is in danger.

7 Last Seed
  
I finally acquired one of the keys once used by worshippers of Mehrunes Dagon to enter the Shrine in the Pale Mountains. 
  
The price was considerable, but if my sources are accurate, the treasures within the abandoned shrine will more than justify the expense. 
  
It is rumored that legendary Mysterium Xarxes is sealed within the main chamber. 
  
Adding the infamous book to my collection would undoubtedly ensure the success of my museum. I must have it before the opening. I set out at dawn tomorrow.
  
  
9 Last Seed
  
I managed to unlock the shrine's door with the key, but the path to the main chamber is obstructed, buried under ice and debris. 
  
Decades, perhaps centuries, have led to the collapse of the corridor. Clearing it will take time. Yet, I am so close. The relics of Mehrunes Dagon are within my reach.
  
  
17 Last Seed
  
I was able to retrieve the Mysterium Xarxes, or at least what was left of it, though it nearly cost me my life.
  
Upon excavating a path to the main chamber, I rushed in without hesitation. 
  
Amidst many treasures in the shrine rested a single tattered page, its script unmistakably that of the Mysterium Xarxes. 
  
My excitement led me to neglect taking percautions against curses and traps, a mistake that was almost fatal.
  
As soon as I touched the parchment, myriad Daedra materialized out of thin air, clearly unpleased to see me. 
  
Dodging fireballs, I barely escaped with the relic and my life. As I exited the shrine, I heard the door slam shut and lock itself behind me.
  
Thankfully, I sustained only minor burns from the encounter. The clothes I wore, however, were not so fortunate. My robes were irreparably singed and my undergarments, while not burnt, will also need replacing.
  
Nonetheless, the fragment of the Mysterium Xarxes now lies secure. It shall be the center piece of the Museum of The Mythic Dawn.
  
  
18 Last Seed
  
I have placed the remains of the Mysterium Xarxes in a display case, ready for the museum’s big day.
  
Though, after recent escapades, I’m taking a much-needed break to rest before opening the museum proper.
  
Despite my knack for locating Mehrunes Dagon’s relics, I think I will leave the heavy lifting to unsuspecting adventurers from now on. Less danger for me, and fewer wardrobe casualties.
  
  
The dialogue added is provided below as well. All responses are voiced using vanilla lines. (Again SPOILERS AHEAD.)
  
Spoiler
  
**Player dialogue is bolded.**
  
Demanding Silus close the museum.
  
[spoiler]
  
**This is wrong. You need to close the museum.**
  
I don't think there's a need for that!
  
My family were in the Mythic Dawn. My museum is our legacy. It's our time now.
  
  
**A. The Mythic Dawn were evil. No good can come from this. (Persuade)**
  
Why should I hide from it? This is my family's legacy!
  
We're done here, I think. Bother someone else.
  
  
**B. Close the museum or you die here and now. (Intimidate)**
  
Fine. I'm not dying without a fight! (Silus will attack player.)
  
  
  
Asking Silus for the key to the shrine.
  
Spoiler
  
**I have read your Journal. I want the key to the shrine.**
  
I don't know what you're talking about.
  
  
**A. The shrine is dangerous. I can clear it out. (Persuade)**
  
*Speech Check Fail*
  
That's none of your business and I appreciate if you wouldn't mention it again.
  
*Speech Check Success*
  
Okay, okay. You've talked me into it.
  
  
**B. Give me the key or I will take it off your corpse. (Intimidate)**
  
*Intimidation Fail*I doubt that very much.
  
*Intimidation Success*
  
Okay, okay. No need to make rash decisions.
  
  
**C. I am willing to pay for it. (Bribe)**
  
Well that's not how I operate, so forget it.
  
  
  
Convince Silus to let you refogre the Razor instead of bringing it to Dagon.
  
Spoiler
  
*Requires either passing a speech check or for the player to have the Daedric smithing perk.*
  
**There is another way, I can reforge it. (Persuade)**
  
*Speech Check Success*
  
How can I argue with that?
  
I can pay you. Just bring it back to me.
  
*Speech Check Fail*
  
Silus will go to the shrine same as in the vanilla quest.
  
  
  
Presenting reforged Razor to Silus if you convinced him to let you do it without Dagon.
  
Spoiler
  
**I have reforged Mehrunes' Razor.**
  
By the gods... I don't even know what to say...
  
 
  
**A. Here it is.**
  
It's magnificent, isn't it? 
  
I can't thank you enough for what you did. Here's your gold, as promised.
  
  
**B. I reclaimed the fragments. I rebuilt the blade. The Razor is mine.**
  
You little thief! You are not worthy!
  
**Take it from me then. Your blood will be first the Razor tastes. (Intimidate)**
  
*Intimidation Success*
  
All right. I don't want any trouble. It's yours.
  
*Intimidation Fail*
  
If that's what it will take then so be it. (Silus will attack player.)
  
  
  
Presenting reforged Razor to Silus if you did not agree to help him find the pieces in the first place or he has not payed you for any of them yet.
  
Spoiler
  
**I have Mehrunes' Razor.**
  
How did you get it? No, never mind, I probably shouldn't know.
  
The Mythic Dawn worshipped Dagon as a god. Having his Razor would be invaluable to my collection.
  
I can pay you.
  
  
**A. Here it is.**
  
It's magnificent, isn't it?
  
I can't thank you enough for what you did. Here's your gold, as promised.
  
  
**B. The Razor is mine. I will not sell it.**
  
Disappointing. If you change your mind, you know where to find me.
  
  
  
Warn Jorgen that he is in danger.
  
Spoiler
  
*Requires not agreeing to help Silus find the pieces and having a copy of "The Keepers of the Razor" in your inventory.*
  
**Be careful, dangerous people are looking for the pieces of Mehrunes' Razor.**
  
Don't know what you're talking about, stranger.
  
  
**Silus Vesuius knows you have the hilt. (Present "The Keepers of the Razor")**
  
I've heard of him. My father had suspicions about his connection to the Mythic Dawn. Guess they were true. I don't need this. My family wasted 8 generations keeping that Razor safe from a dead cult. As far as I care, it can stay locked in my house.
  
**A. Just watch your back. If you need help, I am here.**
  
Strong steel guard you friend.
  
Best leave the past buried, I say.
  
  
**B. Give me the hilt. I will guard it with my life. (Persuade)**
  
*Speech Check Success*
  
You want the hilt that bad? Fine. Here's the keys. It's locked in a chest inside my house.
  
*Speech Check fail*
  
I don't care, but my ancestors do. You can't have it.
