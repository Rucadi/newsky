**Final Farewell**

**Introduction:**
  
Final Farewell revolves around a ghost who remains on this plane after he and a loved one was unjustly murdered. His spirit now wanders Skyrim searching for those responsible for his killing and hoping that avenging their deaths will return him to the afterlife. The quest is split into four encounters, where he will speak to the player of his past life, the death he deals, and what will happen to him after his death is avenged.
  
  
**Features****:**
  

  
* **Unique questline.** I always saw ghosts as completely underutilised in the vanilla game, their unique presence in the TES universe was never fully explored and so I thought I'd make a mod to fix this. This is a completely unique idea for the TES games and should offer an interesting experience along with tying in some events that have happened in the Elder Scrolls lore.
**[size=2][b]Interesting NPC.** [/b]While the Ghost does not have a name, that doesn't mean he's not an interesting character. As you journey with him you'll learn more about his past and how it has affected this 2nd life of his.[/size]
  

  
* **Fully voiced.**The mod has an incredibly talented voice actor, [size=2][D. D. Rumin](https://www.ddrumin.com/)﻿! He did a great job conveying the emotions the Ghost is experiencing and really brought his story to life![/size]
