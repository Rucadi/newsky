This mod adds a brand new Side Quest to Skyrim titled "The Hidden Tomb of Hircine".
  
  
Obtainable after reaching Level 25, the Courier will approach you with a Letter from a Stranger. The man who wrote this letter, Roland Broadmoore, is a Wandering Archaelogist who goes around searching for Tamriel's long lost secrets that have been buried for hundreds of years. Most recently, Roland researched the Bloodmoon Prophecy in addition to all the events that took place afterward to lead him to the conclusion that the Followers of Hircine had taken the body of Hircine's Aspect and buried it in the Ruins of Mortrag Glacier after it had fallen. Roland is now searching for this long, lost, hidden tomb of Hircine. However, he can't do this alone. Many dangers lie in wait in the ruins to protect the sacred body of their Daedric God. Roland needs your help. The Dragonborn's help. 
  
  
Journey with Roland Broadmoore through three new areas: Golgan's Lair, the Ruins of Mortrag, and the Sanctum of Hircine to discover what lies in wait and to etch your name in history.
  
  
This quest is designed to be a LATE GAME Quest. It is near-impossible to complete at lower levels. The Bloodmoon Prophecy in The Elder Scrolls III was designed to be one of the final questlines in the game, so I honor that by making this quest also more of an "End-game Content" quest. If you've quested through Skyrim and raised your character's level into, at least, the thirties along with some good gear, this quest is definitely doable. On top of that, the rewards obtained at the end of the quest are quite overpowered. But, if you're discovering a long lost tomb of a Daedric God, the loot has to be worth it!
  
  
Lastly, I just wanted to say this is the first mod I've created for Skyrim. I have created mods previously for Morrowind but I wanted to dip my hand into the Skyrim pool and use this as an opportunity to learn the Skyrim Creation Kit and make something that I've been thinking about for a long time.

With Version 1.12 - Updating the Version to match The Creation Club version as well as removing a piece of webbing in the Ruins of Mortrag that looked unusual.
