In the vanilla quest "Spread the Love." You pass out pamphlets promoting the Temple of Mara. There's nothing quite like walking up to Maven. Handing her a pamphlet and telling to give at the temple. It's a great quest. 
  
  
  
**What this mod actually does:**1:It expands the list of NPCs you can give pamphlets to. NPCs the original quest missed. Such as Brynjolf, Vekel, Marcurio, and Vex. As well as Viriya and Swims-In-Deep-Water from the Fishing CC.
  
  
2: It changes the reward. To what Dinya says it is instead of a bunch of health potions.
  
  
  
> ﻿"Oh, splendid! Just splendid! Mara smiles upon us this day. Allow me to give you her gift... a true blessing to aid you in times of need. Despair not, her warmth will protect you always!"

  
Now instead of getting a bunch of Health potions. You will get a passive ability called "The Love of Mara", That:
  
  
1: Doubles the duration of Mara's shrine blessing
  
  
2: Increases your armor rating by 25 while you're wearing and amulet of Mara
  
  
3: Increases your health by 25 while wearing "The Bond of Matrimony"
  
  
  
  
  
There's an option file that also lets you give the Pamphlets to character from 3dnpcs. If you want to annoy them too.
