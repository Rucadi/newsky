[/font]**

**[left]Features[/left]**

  
* **New characters:** Meet Haj-Xul, an Argonian from Black Marsh who has recently arrived in Solstheim looking for a wanted fugitive, and Zirath Ryon, a Telvanni wizard on the run for his past crimes against the Argonians.
**Dungeons:** Explore multiple locations across the ashlands, including a large nordic ruin previously buried under the ash.
  
* **Magic:** Unleash the power of Miasma on your foes using 9 brand-new spells and powers.
**Combat:** Fight reavers, draugr, and new powerful foes.
  
* **Lore-Friendly:** I tried to stay as faithful to the lore as I could when writing the story. This mod references various locations and factions from TES lore that were largely not present in Skyrim.
**Fully-Voiced:** Miasma is fully voiced thanks to the contributions of the talented [MeekVoice](https://www.castingcall.club/meekvoice)﻿, [David Pastore-Theriaque](https://www.castingcall.club/dclpt0)﻿﻿ and [Abbas](https://www.castingcall.club/beelzeb0ss97)﻿!

How To Start[/b]
  
  
The quest can be started by speaking to Haj-Xul in the Retching Netch in Solstheim. The player is recommended to be at least level 20, as the quest is scaled accordingly to the rest of the Dragonborn DLC.
  
  
**Installation**Download through your mod manager of choice and follow the instructions in the Fomod. Necessary patches should be automatically detected.
  
  
**Compatibility**Miasma should be compatible with any other mods as long as they don't heavily modify The Retching Netch, or the areas surrounding Raven Rock. Compatibility patches are included inside the FOMOD for all known conflicts.
