[size=6]Before the End

  
Introduction:[/size]**[/u][/size][/b]

  
* Before the End is a short mod that revolves around a single conversation with Aradell, a prisoner awaiting execution. While speaking with him, you'll learn about his biggest regrets and how they have shaped him. While short, the mod offers an introspective look into themes of guilt, remorse and death, all while delivering a unique story with stellar voice acting.

* **Fully voiced.** This quest has been voiced by the incredible [talkingNsuch](https://www.castingcall.club/talkingnsuch)﻿. He did an excellent job voicing this difficult character and has added so much to this project.

  
* **Unique idea.** While a relatively short conversation, the setting and idea for this quest is incredibly unique. The themes told through Aradell's story are not ones touched in the base game and add a feeling of depth to Skyrim's world.
