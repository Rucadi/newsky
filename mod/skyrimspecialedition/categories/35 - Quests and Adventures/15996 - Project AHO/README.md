**Q. Will this be released for SSE or Xbox One?**
  
A. The project is available on:
  
- Skyrim Legendary Edition [PC];
  
- Skyrim Special Edition [PC];
  
- Skyrim Special Edition [XB1].
  
  
**Q. Do I need any plugins or utilities?**
  
A. Nope. No SKSE or FNIS or other mods.
  
  
**Q. Where does the mod take place?**
  
A. The mod takes place in Sadrith Kegran, an underground city located near Steamcrag Camp, Eastmarch.
  
  
**Q. Does the modification affect any city or other parts of Skyrim?**
  
A. The modification hardly affects the landscape from Skyrim. Several exteriors of Dwemer ruins are updated, however, no original object has been moved. Intervention in the game is minimal.
  
  
**Q. How long did it take to develop this mod?**
  
A. More than three years, took the development of the project. Throughout this time frame, several concepts and ideas had changed. Around spring-summer of 2017 the project had settled on its final stage, which was released.
  
  
**Q. Does mod add artifacts from old games of TES?**
  
A. No, that does not quite fit our concept, so there are no artifacts of the past, in fashion. Speaking of which… there is one minor thing from the times of Morrowind, but we will not discuss that, to avoid spoilers. It's more like a tribute to memory, nothing more.
  
  
**Q. I'm used to finding objectives on my own. Can I turn off the markers?**
  
Of course! The entire mod is designed in such a way that you, yourself, are seeking out the objectives. All clues are in the books and notes that the characters give you.
  
  
**Q. Can I play with companions?**
  
We recommend you let go of any companions added by mods, at the start of the game. Companions from the vanilla list will be released automatically.
  
  
**Q. When I try to leave Sadrith Kegran, I have a crash in the game. What could be the problem?**
  
This extremely rare and unknown error can occur when using Climates of Tamriel. Just unplug Climates of Tamriel - save your game - connect it back. Now you can leave Sadrith Kegran without issue.
