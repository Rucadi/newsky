Nedhegoth, The Butcher
  
  
"*The Boiche Elves were of the Earth Bones who most hearkened to Jephre and his greensongs. They did not build a Tower, they grew it, a great graht-oak whose roots sprang from a Perchance Acorn. And this was their Stone. And because the Acorn might perchance have been elsewhere, thus was Green-Sap manifold and several. And each could walk**"*

INTRODUCTION & FEATURES
  
=========================
  
Three bosmer brothers have been ambushing travelers west of Whiterun, since the guards won't dare to follow them into their den because of some rumors about  them being canibals, it's your duty to find them and end their reign of violence.
  
Head to the home of Platus Vedius, their last victim, located north-west of Whiterun and look for clues.
  
  

  
* Includes artifacts Helm of Oreyn Bearclaw and Skullcrusher from previous TES games and lore, also includes several bosmer weapons: a bow, two twin swords, a machete and a kukri.

  

  
* High quality all-new models with HD textures available at 1k, 2k and 4k resolutions.

  

  
* Upon obtaining the artifacts you will be ofered a choice, for Skullcrusher you choose between two-handed and one-handed and for the Helm of Oreyn Bearclaw, Heavy or Light armor.

  

  
* Complex and lorefriendly enchantments, explained below.

  

  
* Everything is temperable at the appropiate workstation with Ebont ingots (machete, kukri and skullcrusher) or dragon bones (everything else). Note that bone weapons benefit from daedric smithing perk, since dragonbone weapons are not in vanilla i don't want to make it require a DLC just for that, but the crafting material is still dragon bone.

  

  
* [size=3]Bosmer Kukri and Machete will be available for crafting once you find a note in one of the tables of the first room of the cave, you'll also need ebony smithing perk. Alternatively, to enable the crafting of those without the note use the following console command without quotes:  "set FFNGCanCraftBosmerWeapons to 1"

===================================
  
HOW AND WHERE TO START THE QUEST?
  
===================================
  
Go to the hom of Platus Vedious, north-west of Whiterun to start it, then follow instructions given by objectives and notes found during the quest. There is an image of the map marking the home.
  
  
During the quest you will face very powerful and high-level enemies, so it's recommended to be level 40-50 before starting it.
  
  
============================
  
DESCRIPTION OF THE ARTIFACTS
  
============================
  
  
> Helm of Oreyn Bearclaw
  
--------------------------------------
  
*"The helm itself is an enchanted skull, which is said to improve the wearer's agility and endurance"*Since skyrim doesn't have agility and endurance, it's enchantment is based on the result of those stats in Oblivion:
  
  
- You stagger 50% less, stamina regenerates 40% faster and fortifies both health and stamina by 60 points.
  
  
> Skullcrusher
  
-----------------
  
"*The steel is magically hardened and the weight of the weapon is amazingly light, which makes for more powerful swings and deadly blows"*
  
- Lightweight warhammer with fortify carryweight by 15 points, resulting in "0 weight" while equipped, just like in Morrowind.
  
  
Since those effects are a result of the properties of it's material and not an enchanted effect, it can be further enchanted with the enchantment of your choice like any unenchanted weapon.
  
  
> Nedhegoth's Right Hand and Nedhegoth's Left Hand
  
[size=4]-------------------------------------------------------------
  
- Two bosmer bone swords, when wielded together both absorb 25 points of health
  
- Charge depletes by itself over time.
  
- Recharge by killing enemies with them (both will recharge upon killing an enemy with them, they can be recharged with soul gems too but since charge depletes by itself it's a bit of a waste)
  
  
> Aengoth's Bow
  
-------------------
  
- Bosmer bone bow that does 30 points of poison damage and has a chance to paralyze enemies.
  
  
> Kukri and Machete
  
-----------------------
  
- Unenchanted.
