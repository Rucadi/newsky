Lost Paladin creation club content is way to easy in my opinion. This turns him into a Boss Fight with an absurd amount of health and boosted starts. Now if you survive Chrysamere will feel even better to obtain.. 
  
  
In the optional files you have SPID he will also be carrying a unique set of armor.
  
The unique set of armor is the Dragonborn Crusader Armor by Simdrew1993. The modification permissions are open so I modified the esp, however you will need his mods assets such as the meshes/textures for the SPID file to work correctly.
