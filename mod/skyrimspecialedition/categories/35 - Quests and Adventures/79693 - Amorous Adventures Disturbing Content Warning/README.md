PREAMBLE**
  
  
Perhaps you have heard of some of the less savory aspects of *Skyrim* modding. Perhaps not. If you haven't, you may not be aware that the normally rather tame mod *Amorous Adventures* has some pretty hairy content in it that may serve as triggering incidents for some sensitive players. I didn't want these to be an unpleasant surprise for users of my massive *Skyrim Wabbajack* modlist, *Licentia BLACK*, so I added a content warning to these quests.
  
  
The content warning is modeled after the one for *Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2's*original message prefacing the controversial mission "No Russian." It does not contain any spoiler(s) for any of the quest(s) and merely states that the quest is disturbing and may offend some players.
  
  
 I decided to upload it here so others might be able to benefit if so desired. I suppose the only real use for it is in other public modlists similar to mine, but you might also install this ESP if you decide to show your own collection of hornymods to someone whose opinion you sorta care about. Never fear, it is ESL-flagged so it will not take up a slot in your load order.
  
  
**INSTALLATION**
  
  
First determine if your version of *Amorous Adventures* is derived from the SexLab Original or the "reboot" known as *Amorous Adventures Plus.*The Original *Amorous Adventures*was from \**a regrettable offsite location\**and also includes offshoots on Nexus such as *Amorous Adventures OSex Edition, Amorous Adventures OSex Clean, Amorous Adventures for OStim,* and *Amorous Adventures CLEAN SSE.*
  
  
The *Plus* version was derived from *Amorous Adventures Plus* available on Nexus and includes the offshoot *Amorous Adventures for OpenSex.*
  
  
If you are in doubt, just check the name of the ESP you downloaded. The Original is titled "SexLab-AmorousAdventures.esp" and the Plus derivative is called "AmorousAdventuresPlus.esp."
  
  
Install the correct version. The incorrect version will have no effect and if enabled may crash your game due to a Missing Master error. Load it below any rewrites you have installed such as *Amorous Adventures Rewrite* or *Amorous Adventures Player Dialogue Rewritten.* It is fully compatible with them but must override them to have any effect.
  
  
Finally, a pro-tip: don't play this mod around your Grandmother, even with the Content Warning installed.
  
  
If you wish to know specifically what the content is and how it is presented: read on.
  
  
**WHY DID I ADD THESE WARNINGS?**
  
  
In the Mjoll *Amorous Adventure*, Aerin is portrayed as a creepy manipulative incel type who is using a pain poison to intimidate the women of Riften into having sex with him. The quest does involve foiling his repugnant plans, but a great deal of non-consensual content is implied. Likewise, in the Idgrod the Younger *Amorous Adventure* in Morthal, this young daughter learns to process the loss of her sister via engaging in sexual activity near her corpse, which is a little too necrophiliac for my personal taste.
  
  
There you are, now you know.
