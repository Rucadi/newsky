Back when I used to use Amorous Adventures, I enjoyed it for adding romance content and fleshing out some of the game's characters. However, I was never quite pleased with how AA made my character act and speak in comparison to the rest of the game. Seeing as how nobody had yet done something like this, I decided to take a crack at it.
  
  
Obviously, a sculptor is only as good as his clay, and in this case, my Amorous Adventures-shaped clay still has confines I have to work in. So, while I hope to minimize how pushy, dickish, and out-of-character your Dragonborn acts, at the end of the day, he or she will still be a pretty big horndog - the hole is still the goal. That's the way it is.
  
  
Covers player dialogue in every Amorous Adventures quest, additionally tweaking various notes, item names, spell names, fade-to-black messages, quest objectives, and other miscellaneous text.

Flagged as ESL.
  
  
This was made using the "Clean" version of Amorous Adventures as a base, but it is compatible with all versions of Amorous Adventures except Amorous Adventures Plus.
