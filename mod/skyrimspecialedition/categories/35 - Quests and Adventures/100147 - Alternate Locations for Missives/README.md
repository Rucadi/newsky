As the old JK Skyrim Missive patch has since been deleted, I have made a new one for JK's Skyrim and Missives, as requested by a collection that used the old patch keep in mind that the locations in this one especially for solitude and windhelm will be in a fairly different spot then in either base missives or the old patch.
  
  
I have tried to put them in locations that I think look good or that will be easily seen and accessed. If there are any boards that are clipping or are in locations that are not easily accessible then please tell me and I will update the patch.
  
  
I have not uploaded pictures of the Winterhold location as I am using Legacy of the Dragonborn, and it's missive patch moves it as well (and that mod is lower in my load order).
