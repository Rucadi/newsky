**Compatibility**
  

  
* Don't use outdated translations or patches. It will fuck up your game. Unless they state they are compatible with the latest version **explicitly by version number**, assume they are outdated.

**Known Issues (Skyrim Engine Bug)**
  

  
* If you progress through the quest, then, without restarting the SkyrimSE.exe, reload to an earlier point in the quest or to before the quest started, the game may enter a bad state and prevent quest progress.
    
  [list]
[Here is a demonstration of this bug](https://youtu.be/PJPzMAXSprU)﻿.
  
* This is due to current game information (such as quest state or object position) not being completely reset and erroneously persisting into the save you are trying to load.
This can manifest as quests not starting, objects not appearing in their original positions, etc.
  
* This is a known Skyrim engine bug that can be resolved by restarting SkyrimSE.exe.
If you encounter issues like this, you might be able to resolve it by restarting the SkyrimSE.exe and loading an earlier save from before the bad reload.
  

[\*]The hut and the maze are both pretty cramped. So probably don't bring your team of 10 followers in there. They will block paths and knock things over.
