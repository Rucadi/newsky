In the Velothi Mountains east of Windhelm lies the Serpent Pit, an arena offering vicious bloodsport. People from the region and beyond gather there to risk their life in battle, or their money in bets. Those that make it to the final rounds are said to be offered a special challenge...
  
  
The Serpent Pit adds an arena with its own questline and unique reward. Another quest will then allow you to improve said reward to its full power. Even after the end of the questline, you can fight in an unlimited number of matches, or relax while you watch or bet on matches of other combatants. 
  
The new characters are fully voiced by talented voice actors.
  
To start, find one of the leaflets around Windhelm, or directly visit the Serpent Pit in the mountains behind Brandy-Mug Farm.
