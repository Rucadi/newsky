**Description**
  

  
* More than a decade later, most players still have no idea how this puzzle works and just spam buttons. [Example 1](https://old.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/mna6vv/how_does_the_tower_of_mzark_puzzle_work/)﻿, [Example 2](https://old.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/zw1r7k/how_are_you_even_supposed_to_find_out_the/)﻿, [Example 3](https://old.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/6ndy72/tower_of_mzark/)﻿, [Example 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/59kmku/the_presseverybuttonandpray_puzzle/)﻿.
The puzzle is exactly the way it was before, except now there is a pretty user interface to illustrate the logic of the buttons.
  
* This mod does not alter the functionality of the vanilla puzzle; it only adds the display. There might be some jank left over from the vanilla implementation, such as if you click the buttons too fast. I absolve myself of all responsibility from issues stemming to the vanilla implementation.
[Assorted Mesh Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32117) and [Lux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43158)﻿ mesh changes already included (neither is required).
  
* ESL.
