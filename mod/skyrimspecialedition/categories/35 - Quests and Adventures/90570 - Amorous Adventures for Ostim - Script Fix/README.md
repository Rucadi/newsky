**Please check out the original mod that this fix is made for [Amorous Adventures for Ostim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48912)**
  
  
For Nexus Staff: The Original Mod Author for the mod stated above didn't credit anything correctly and the description/permission section makes it seem like they've made the original mod from scratch when they didn't and theirs is just a port of the Original AA mod, and didn't credit the framework they ported the Original AA mod to. (Ostim/Ostim NG)
  
AA = Amorous Adventures
  
  
***Note:
  
1. I may also make other script fixes if suggested, but until then, it will only be touching Sybille Stentor.*
  
*Im sorry if this didn't work for anyone, hopefully NOW it will work. <3 Love you guys.
  
  
This bug was found because of the community for the Immersive collections (found below) and was created so other people that have this issue outside of the community can downl**oad it*.
  
  
  
Installation -**
  
  
A) If downloaded with a mod manager, make sure my file overwrites (load after) the original mod.
  
  
B) If downloaded manually, drag and drop the Source file in your Data folder and click yes to replace files if it asks (Which it should if you have the OG mod installed.)
  
  
  
This mod/patch was made with [Immersive & Adult](https://next.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/collections/xxsqm4) and [Immersive & Epic](https://next.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/collections/rvxts8) in mind, but will work with the OG mod for ostim otherwise.
