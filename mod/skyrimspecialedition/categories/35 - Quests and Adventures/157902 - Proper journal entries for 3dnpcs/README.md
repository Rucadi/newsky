In the base game. Quests have Journal entries in addition to quest objectives. While most 3dnpcs only have quest objectives in the journal. Here's an example of a journal entry for a vanilla quest.

As you progress the quests the journal updates. With new entries to reflect the developing story. As most 3dnpcs quests lacked these I added my own to 39 of them. (E.G)
