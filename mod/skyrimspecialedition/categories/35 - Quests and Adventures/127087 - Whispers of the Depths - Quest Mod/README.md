**Whispers of the Depths**

**Introduction:**
  
Whispers of the Depths revolves around a retired sailor, Slays-Many-Beasts. Through your encounters with the fisherman, you'll learn all about the many dangerous sea creatures within the lore of the Elder Scrolls and how Slays-Many-Beasts dealt with the threat they posed to him and his crew. Each encounter will bring a new story about a different beast and should allow for players to learn more about these mysterious monsters in a digestible way.
  
  
**Features****:**
  

  
* **Unique questline.** Though a few mods try to remedy this, the base game offers little to no information on sea creatures and the threat they pose to Tamriel's inhabitants. This mod expands upon this aspect while building an incredibly unique NPC and giving him a reasonable and very interesting backstory.

  
* **[size=2][b]Interesting NPC.**[/b] As mentioned, Slays-Many-Beasts is much more than a means to learn about the waters of Tamriel, and instead has unique motivations and a very special story which seamlessly integrates many beasts of the sea.[/size]

  
* **Fully voiced.**The mod features extremely high-quality voice acting. [size=2][Alex Cain](https://www.castingcall.club/complete-the-circuit) has countless hours of experience and has personally voice acted in many of my mods. I believe this is some of his best work and fleshes out this Argonian fisherman in a very unique way![/size]
