Introduction:**[/u][/size][/b]

  
* Once We Were Here revoles around the aforementioned scholar of the Falmer and Snow Elves, Sillas. As you encounter him across various historical sites around Skyrim and Solsthiem, you'll be able to learn about the tragic story of the Snow Elves and their eventual descent into the Falmer. He'll be diving into the various battles and atrocities within the Snow Elves' long and storied history. This is all written completely within the lore and weaves another underlying narrative, making Sillas more than a walking lore dispenser.

* **Unique questline.** This quest follows a similar format to some of my other lore based mods, with information being given to the player in bit size chunks, all located at historicly significant sites. The conversations discussed will paint the tragic and tormented past of the Snow Elves, all in an engaging manner while weaving a secondary narrative during these encounters. I ensured that everything Sillas discusses is completely from the lore and his own story never takes away from the primary focus of this mod.

  
* **Interesting NPC.** Sillas' own unique story should prove him to be a very unique character, touching upon topics that were never approached within the base game. Those familiar with the recent past of Tamriel may also find the story particularly interesting, though I won't say any more.

  
* **Quest Commentary.** Due to the revelations that can be uncovered within a variety of Skyrim's base game questlines which relate to the Snow Elves or Falmer, Sillas will have dialogue accomodating the player's discoveries. Assuming the required quests are complete, he'll be fascinated to hear of your findings and the potential they contain

  
* **Fully voiced.** This quest has been voiced by a familiar face within my mods, [D. D. Rumin](https://www.ddrumin.com/). As always, he did an incredible job voicing this unique and intelligent character, bringing him to life with one of his best performances to date!
