﻿

**Quest Walkthrough**Spoiler

  
* Quest will trigger the next time you visit a **major city** like Solitude or Whiterun. If you are already in a major city, go to a different major city. The outskirts of a major city counts as part of the city.
You'll receive a note. Read it to start the quest.
  
* Go to the bandit camp indicated in the note and retrieve the snow globe from the chest.
Click on the snow globe in your inventory to enter the snow globe world.
  
* Retrieve the house key from the suspicious rock hide-a-key near the door. Hint for this is in a chest behind the house.
Chop 3 pieces of firewood from the chopping block outside the house.
  
* Light the hearth with the firewood.
Satie will walk through the house door and give you a todo list. Read the todo list.
  
* Gather snowberries outside the house and place the wreaths around the house.
Gather tundra cotton outside the house, craft Saturalia socks, and place the socks on the fireplace mantel.
  
* Gather iron ingots at the smithing area outside the house, craft Saturalia ornaments, and place the ornaments on the Christmas tree.
Gather a gold ingot at the smithing area outside the house, craft a Saturalia star, and place the star on the Christmas tree on the second floor.
  
* Talk to Satie. She'll place some gift boxes near the Christmas tree.
Retrieve your gift to complete the quest.
  
* You can now craft Christmas items at the forge in the snow globe world.
You can now use the snow globe to enter or exit the snow globe world.
  
* Satie becomes a follower.
  
**Install/Uninstall/Update**

* Install: whenever doesn't matter.
Update: whenever doesn't matter. Outdated translations and esp replacers won't work.
  
* Uninstall: don't do it while inside the snow globe world.

**A Note About A Skyrim Engine Bug**
  

  
* Reloading earlier saves without restarting SkyrimSE.exe is problematic because the game world doesn't completely reset.
[Here is a detailed video demonstrating an example of this bug](https://youtu.be/PJPzMAXSprU)﻿.
  
* If you encounter issues with this mod's quest or other quests, it might be due to this issue.

**Requirements**
  

  
* [Kreiste's Christmas Fantasy Outfit](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80572/)﻿
    
  [list]
Make sure you have its requirements too.

**FAQ**
  
> ﻿Q: Is "Saturalia" a typo?
>   
> A: This how it is spelled in Elder Scrolls. [Lore:Saturalia](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Saturalia)﻿
>   
>   
> Q: I ate all the Snowberries, Tundra Cotton, and Ingots and now can't complete the quest
>   
> A: You shouldn't have done that. Either fail the quest by speaking to Satie or reload an earlier save.
>   
>   
> Q: Quest start won't trigger.
>   
> A: If you are in a city, go to a different city. Also try restarting Skyrim.
>   
>   
> Q: Is the Christmas outfit requirement a requirement? the outfit has "crazy requirements".
>   
> A: Kreiste's Christmas outfit has no "crazy requirements", the only thing needs is hdt-smp.
>
>   
> * If you don't want hdt-smp, you can just get the optional file: [non-physics Santa hat meshes](https://www.nexusmods.com/Core/Libs/Common/Widgets/DownloadPopUp?id=342902&nmm=1&game_id=1704)﻿
> or the [Creation Club Mashup version](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81236)﻿ by [Laptoprocker](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/6020930) (Make sure it is not outdated).
>   
>
> Q: I am stuck on the quest.
>   
> A: Read the quest walkthrough.
>   
>   
> Q: I am using a translation and/or a mod of this mod and everything is broken.
>   
> A: If those replace the ESP instead of patching it, they become outdated with future updates of this mod and will revert bug fixes and/or cause other bugs due to inconsistencies. Don't use outdated ESP-replacers.
>   
>   
> Q: I can't find the key. Is the mod bugged?
>   
> A: No. The key is nearby. Don't assume the mod is bugged because you have no patience.
