>   
> Q: I don't know how to get into the [Soul Cairn](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Soul_Cairn).
>   
> A: Play the game instead of browsing Nexus all day. [Soul Cairn](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Soul_Cairn)﻿ is unlocked after completing [Chasing Echoes](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Chasing_Echoes). Or you can cheat, console "coc DLC01SoulCairnOrigin".

>   
> Q: I can't reach or find the bandit and/or warlock dungeons.
>
