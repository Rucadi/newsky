Do you like OStim?  Of course I do.
  
But I don't like to get laid with every women in my sight without any context, so I have made several OStim patches of quest mods, and this one is the first public release.
  
  
This is a modified version of mini quests mod ["More Adventures For Flower Girls"](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40029) by [Sicilian](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/94916868) with OStim integration.
  
You can be intimate with **Arivanya, Bryling, Constance Michel, Nilsine Shatter-Shield, Nivenor, Muiri, Vittoria Vici, Vivienne Onis**.
  
  
**Changes from Original Mod**
  
  
**Stories:**
  
There are NO STORY CHANGES & ADDITIONS, but a slight modifications to bring each ladies to somewhere private, because if you use my ["You Got Caught For OStim SA"](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/139697) mod or OCrime, you will be arrested in some of the stories.
  
**[updated v1.1.0]** To adapt the nice to have mod ["Return Aegisbane,"](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/108242) added the dialogue branch to persuade Nilsine without the heirloom.﻿ 
  
  
**Aftermath:**
  

  
* After the quests done, you have a possibility to be a lover to those ladies, and you can spend time with them without installing Flower Girls. (OStim works well, but not required to enjoy the role play.)
Even in a relationships, I made these partners may reject you sometimes, especially in a "discreet" relation. Because they should have their life too, understand?
  

**Requirements:**
  
This mod has no hard requirements.
  
You can play this without OStim & Flower Girls.
  
Original requires USSEP but it is also not required for this version.

**Overview**
  
Inspired by Xiderpunk’s Adventures addon for [Flower Girls](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5941) and FoxFinger’s [Amorous Adventures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/70495), this mod features several unmarked dialogue-driven mini-quests with
  
light usage of self-containing scripts. If you’re looking for more
  
romanceable NPCs for Flower Girls, this is the mod for you! Features
  
fully voiced dialogue using vanilla assets, some I personally spliced
  
and others referenced from other great mods credited below.
  
  
What I had envisioned for this project is to organically introduce romance
  
candidates based on the Dragonborn’s actions, so these side quests
  
will spontaneously be made available only when certain conditions are
  
fulfilled e.g. upon completing certain vanilla quests, milestones or by
  
finding certain items. I’ve tried within my means to keep the dialogues
  
as believable as possible and try to avoid making the DB come across as
  
an utter degenerate. Where feasible, I have included options to decline
  
the romance and/or receive alternative forms of payment instead.
  
  
List of Romanceable NPCs: **Arivanya, Bryling, Constance Michel, Nilsine Shatter-Shield, Nivenor, Muiri, Vittoria Vici, Vivienne Onis**
  
**Release Highlights:**
  

  
* *To Comfort a Mourner***-** Adds a quest where the Dragonborn can undertake Muiri’s contract after
    
  having destroyed the Dark Brotherhood and arrange for reconciliation between Muiri & the Shatter-Shields. There is also an option to return Aegisbane to Torbjorn Shatter-Shield.
*New Follower & Marriage Candidates -*Nilsine & Vivienne will be available to marry after their respective
  
romance quests; they were likely intended to be marriable evidenced by underlying scripts. Bryling will be available as a follower, she is already set as essential by default.
  
For a detailed walkthrough of quests, see spoilers below.
  
  
  
Spoiler
  
  
**Kind-Hearted Constance** - Visit Constance Michel after completing the quest: "Innocence Lost". You will now be able to offer a donation to her and initiate the romance right after. Upon completing the quest, you can donate to Constance at any time.
  
  
**Unfaithful Nivenor** - Blackmail Nivenor using the "Requested Report" that you can find in Bolli's house.
  
  
**Arivanya in Distress** - Approach Arivanya after you have saved her from the Butcher in "Blood on the Ice".
  
  
**To Comfort A Mourner** - Contains 2 Parts:
  
1) Speak with Nilsine after completing "Blood on the Ice". She will have a positive disposition towards you.
  
2) Part 2 is only available to those who completed the quest "Destroy the Dark Brotherhood". Speak to Nilsine again and she will direct you to find Muiri in Markarth to discover her "contract". Upon agreeing to settle Muiri's problem, some guards will comment on "Aegisbane", which is the proof you will need to recover from Alain and bring to Nilsine. Return to Muiri after convincing Nilsine to complete the quest. You can ask Nilsine about Aegisbane which she happily tells you to keep, or you may approach Torbjorn to return it to him for a leveled amount of gold. Nilsine will be a potential spouse (along with Muiri) after quest completion. Part 2 is meant to serve as a parallel version of the DB quest "Mourning Never Comes" exclusively for non-assassins.
  
**The Reliable Bryling** - Speak with Bryling after you are the Thane of Haafingar and have completed "Pactur's Request". She will be available as a follower if you accepted her invitation.
  
  
**Baroness of the East** - Approach Vittoria after completing "Rise in the East".
  
  
**Sultry Vivienne** - Talk to Vivienne at any time after you have convinced Elisif to restore King Olaf's Festival for the Bards as part of the quest "Tending the Flames". You will need to give her "Spiced Wine" when she prompts you for a drink.
