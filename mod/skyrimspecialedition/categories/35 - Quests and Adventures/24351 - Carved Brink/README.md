Carved Brink is a large quest modification, from the authors of [Project AHO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15996). This mod adds to Skyrim: a daedric plan of Peryite - The Pits, and an unknown part of Oblivion - Faceted Stones. One of the many Daedric pocket planes hidden throughout Oblivion. Many years ago, it was inhabited by Snow Elves, but now this place belongs to another race - Goblin. Embark on an adventure for treasure, make unusual acquaintances, and be tested with the trial of the Daedra

**Q. Will this be released for SSE or Xbox One?**
  
A. The project is available on:
  
- Skyrim Legendary Edition [PC];
  
- Skyrim Special Edition [PC];
  
- Skyrim Special Edition [XB1].
  
  
**Q. Do I need any plugins or utilities?**
  
A. Nope. No SKSE or FNIS or other mods.
  
  
**Q. Does the modification affect any existing city or other parts of Skyrim?**
  
A. The modification hardly affects the landscape of Skyrim. Intervention in the game is minimal.
  
  
**Q. Does the mod add artifacts from old games of TES?**
  
A. No, that does not quite fit our concept, so there are no artifacts of the past, in fashion.
  
  
**Q. I'm used to finding objectives on my own. Can I turn off the markers?**
  
Of course! The entire mod is designed in such a way that you, yourself, are seeking out the objectives. All clues are in your journal, are spoken by the characters, or in items (such as books/notes) you are handed.
  
  
**Q. Can I play with companions?**
  
Yes! Perhaps.
