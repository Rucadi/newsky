**Revealing Rune**
  
Rune of the Thieves Guild alludes to a hidden backstory, as he tells you how he was shipwrecked, found with nothing but small stones in his pocket with runes inscribed. But alas, you are unable to help Rune discover his true past. That is, until now... 
  
  
Like many in Skyrim, Rune has always felt like he had more of a story to tell. But, for whatever reason, this wasn't implemented. Now when you tell Rune you'll keep an eye out for information on his past, you can stay true to your word! Search along the coast of Solitude and find out what happened to Rune and his parents. Discover the meaning of the runes inscribed on the stones that Rune washed up with. Reveal Rune's lineage.
