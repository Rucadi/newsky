Extract the contents to your Skyrim Special Edition data folder.
  
   
This includes:
  

  
* [size=4]Retirement.esp
   
Retirement.bsa   
- Fredas\_Night\_Fashion.esp
Fredas\_Night\_Fashion.bsa   
- radovar's revenge.esp
radovar's revenge.bsa   
   
I plan on merging the quests into a single .esp and .bsa files once merging tools have been updated for Skyrim Special Edition.
  
   
Note that small edits have been made to the Tamriel world-space, so compatibility with other mods cannot be guaranteed, although the conflicts should be rare.
