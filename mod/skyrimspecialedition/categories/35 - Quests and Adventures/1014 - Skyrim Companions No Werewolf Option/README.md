The Companions questline is a good one. But the one thing I didn't like about it was that you had to become a werewolf and to get cured from Lycanthropy you had to complete the questline. And I never liked being a werewolf. This mod will allow you to choose weather you want to be a werewolf in the [The Silver Hand](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Silver_Hand) quest when your in the Underforge for the first time. If you choose to not become a werewolf you must do a task for the Circle to be accepted into the Circle of the Companions. Once this task is done you can meet up with Aela the Huntress near Gallows Rock and you will continue on with the [The Silver Hand](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Silver_Hand) quest. By taking the no werewolf option you will skip the transformation of becoming a werewolf.
