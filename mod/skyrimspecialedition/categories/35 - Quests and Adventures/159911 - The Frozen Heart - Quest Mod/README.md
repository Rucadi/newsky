**FAQ**
> Q: I saw other mods featuring Snow Elves. Are they the same mod as this mod?
>   
> A: No. Mods featuring the Snow Elves are not all the same mod.
>   
>   
> Q: Is **Othriel** too trusting of the player?
>   
> A: No: SpoilerThe only people capable of entering the mirrors are Tongues, and the Tongues have followed the pacifist Way of The Voice for thousands of years ever since Jurgen Windcaller (circa 1E500). Should there be an exception, **Siwe**'s questioning serves as an additional filter, permitting passage only to those who are sympathetic to Snow Elf culture, reaffirm the pacifist teachings of The Way of The Voice, and do not lie.
>   
> Q: How come people who don't know the shouts were able to enter?
>   
> A: There is no evidence of this, not in any of the dialog or notes. SpoilerThe only person mentioned to have met **Othriel** during her exile is a Tongue named **Fornskjald**, who knew how to shout.
>   
> Q: I encountered a puzzle that's not completely brain dead, and I don't immediately know how to solve it. What do I do?
>   
> A: Do: try to solve the puzzle. Don't: assume the mod is broken, immediately cheat your way up impossible ledges, clip through doors, and possibly trigger things that would be otherwise impossible to trigger if playing normally. The puzzles in the mod don't require anything more than being observant and knowing some basic arithmetic. Believe in yourself; you're not that dumb. For your own enjoyment, please don't use paraglider or skyparkour to reach impossible places in this mod or any other mod unless you're using a mod specifically designed around these mechanics. You don't need anything other than vanilla movement mechanics to play this mod.
