**Requirements:**
  
**[The Forgotten City](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1179)**
  
  
**Description:**
  
Upon finishing the quest with a "good" ending, that is when you
  
Spoilerconvince "You Know Who" to stop,
  
makes some changes on some locations and NPCs.
  
  
**Disclaimer:**
  
These changes are **not canon to TFC's story** and are just based on my own "what if" thoughts.
  
  
The changes are applied **once you activate the door to exit the mine**.
  
**Here's a list of the changes made:** **(Beware! You might get spoiled by reading these changes!!!)** 
  
Spoiler
  
Instead of being disabled, the following NPCs were moved to different locations and were given new schedules:
  
    Safira - After leaving the Forgotten City, she can now be located in Solitude's Temple of the Divines.
  
    Marius - He now hangs out in Riften's Bee and Barb.
  
    Ulrin and Maisi - After leaving Skyrim, they are now located in Raven Rock's temple, along with a couple of new rooms in the basement.
  
Altrius and Cassia will now be sleeping in Marius' former room during their tour at night and will finally settle in the city after 5 days.
  
There are now some moss and hanging vegetations in the area around the lonely tower.
  
The cave dwellers have started growing crops in the cave along with fishing, so now they won't be too hungry to eat you.
  
The cave dwellers have also dug further into the collapsed mine, which now serves as some kind of rest area.
  
The chest in the Player's chambers, in front of the locked room, and in the lonely tower are now replaced by their safe storage version.
  
Interacting with the Player's chest will automatically store the Cassia's Plea letter in it, in case you can't get rid of it from your inventory.
  
Since Dooley now lives in Ulrin's house, the ownership of the beds in there has been changed so that he can now actually sleep.
  
Cleaned up the locked room and turned it into a regular room with some furnishings.
  
Fixed the water leak in the locked room.
  
Removed some rubble in the citadel.
  
  
  
**Compatibility:**
  
This mod changes the AI Package of some of the NPCs in The Forgotten City, so any mod that touches the same NPCs (e.g. appearance mods) might need a patch.
  
This mod touches a bed in Solitude's Temple of the Divines. **A patch for JK's Temple of the Divines is available in the downloads**.
  
This mod adds a couple of new rooms in the basement of the Temple in Raven Rock. So if you have a mod that touches the interior of that temple, it might cause conflict. So far, I haven't seen such mod though.
