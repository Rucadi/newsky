Often times, when your player character becomes powerful enough, the plot of AHO feels a bit... restrictive. So why not start AHO immediately?
  
This mod adds an option into Alternate Perspective that will let you start as a captured slave. A true rags to riches story for your character!
  
  
This mod supports both v3 and v4 of Alternate Perspective.
  
  
Note that AHO typically requires you to be level 15 to start, meaning you'll be quite underpowered. I recommend you actually get to know Sadrith and it's residents. AHO has a lot more content than you'd think.
  
  
The scenario is named "I was sold into slavery" in v4 and "I was kidnapped and sold into slavery" in v3.
