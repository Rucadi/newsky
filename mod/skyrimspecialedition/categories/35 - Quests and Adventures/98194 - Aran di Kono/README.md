Names are funny things, yes? One can be shared by many if you are small, but then only one to call your own is not enough if you are so grand and sleek as the Great Cats. The Great Cat King of Time has many names. Alkosh, Akatosh, Auri-El, Alduin. Though this one wonders, do all of these titles truly belong to the First Cat? Many scholars would say yes, but Ruz has heard that some among the snow would bare their fangs and laugh at those who speak to Alkosh and wait for Alduin to answer.*-  -  -

  
Two Moon-Priests from Sunspire have forsaken the warm sands of Elsweyr to brave the blizzards of the north in search of answers. Are Alkosh and Alduin one and the same? Or does the shadow stand separate from the light? What truths they find will determine the course their order charts as a new chapter of history begins. Hope is a fickle thing, but sometimes there are stars hiding behind the clouds.
  
  
Embark upon a quest to aid these priests and unravel this riddle of names. Pursue tomes of promised wisdom, unearth the answers etched within, and decide for yourself how this story will end. This mod features a branching narrative with immersive voice acting intertwining the tongues of Tamrielic and Ta’agra. To begin your journey, seek out Jo’ruzimargo and Ko’mojvarri down by the docks near the East Empire Trading Company Warehouse beneath the cliffs of Solitude.
