What happened to the Gray Cowl after Oblivion? No one knows for sure, but it's a part of Creation Club contents with a short quest to it. The story itself is not bad, could have been elaborated better I guess, but my problem with it is how an important figure, the Gray Fox, pretty much has nothing to say at all. Similar to my other mods in Voiced Narrative series, this mod will replace the generic lines used in the quest with new ones to reflect the story better. This one doesn't add more to the story that already existed, the Gray Fox in Skyrim is a selfish thief that misused the cowl for his own good and here it is still so, but now you can sense regret in his words and his hope for a better successor than him, therefore making this encounter more memorable.

**FAQ:**

Yes.
  
  
**Is this compatible with Unofficial Skyrim Creation Club Content Patches?**
  
Yes.
  
**[b]I noticed some grammar errors and thought a few lines could be improved?**
  
[/b]I'm always open to any feedback on improving dialogue and grammar**,**but please provide helpful feedback over one-liner criticism.
  
**Is this compatible with my face overhaul mod that change the same NPCs from this mod?**
  
Yes, it only changes dialogue records, NPCs are left intact.
  
  
**Will this break my save?**
  
This mod mainly edited dialogue records that already existed. It's safe to install mid game; removing it will just revert everything back to vanilla lines.**If you like this mod, be sure to check out my Voiced Narrative series:**
