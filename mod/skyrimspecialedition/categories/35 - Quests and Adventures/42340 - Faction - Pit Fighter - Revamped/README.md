I've always had a soft spot for Faction - Pit Fighter, perhaps it's just nostalgia but I still believe that even after all these years it's the best arena mod available for Skyrim. When I was replaying it recently I ran into a lot of small little issues and quirks that bugged me. I went about to rectify these and eventually it became so expansive that I thought that others out there may enjoy the fixes I made.

* Fixed a large number of typos and grammatical errors.
Fixed weird inconsistencies in the world (such as the Doorman requiring you to pass a speech check to spectate even if you're a member of the Pit Fighters).
  
* Modified numerous dialogue structures to make the mod flow better.
Reworked Travels to have better integration in the main mod (it is now a reward to defeating all the Skyrim champions as opposed to just being given to you).
  
* Gave all the foreign arena teams a unique aesthetic complete with new custom gear and weapons that you can win as rewards.
Small quality of life changes too numerous to mention individually.
