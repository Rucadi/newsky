Melea Entius Tweaks**
  
**Introduction:**[/size]

  
* This mod is incredibly small and just makes it so that Melea Entius will pass away after three weeks from when she is first spoken to. It will add in a grave and some other changes to Henrietta's behaviour after her death. This mod was initially made as a commission by me but I have full permission to upload it here!

  
  
  
**Details:**

  
* After Melea's death, Henrietta will move in with Mathies and Indara like she mentions in her dialogue. There will also be a grave placed for Melea which Henrietta will visit everyday. A letter can also be found within Corpselight Farm once Melea dies, it's a fairly lengthy note from Melea to Henrietta which will disclose everything Melea wished to teach her daughter. Henrietta's AI packages are also changed so that she will now adjust to the new house and loss of her mother. You can also have a brief conversation with her after her mother's passing, the dialogue is extremely limited as it uses Morrigan's lines.

  
  
  
[size=5]**Compatibility:**
  

  
* The mod edits Corpselight Farm's interior, a cell in Falkreath opposite the lumber mill and Henrietta's actor. I have made a patch for COTN Falkreath as without it, the grave is obstructed. I have also provided a patch for RS Children Overhaul.
