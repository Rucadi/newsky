Before the trial by fire of [VIGILANT](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11849/?)﻿, the horrors of [GLENMORIL](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32998)﻿ and the gentle cold of [UNSLAAD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11789)﻿, there comes [DAC0DA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/134405)﻿, and with it, the Numidium. Who's just standing there. Menacingly. Looming. Over the entire Skyrim.
  
  
... but maybe it's better for it not to do that from the moment you reach level 15. It's a little too intimidating quite that soon, isn't it?
  
  
This patch will prevent Numidium from jump-scaring you until certain conditions are met.
  
  
**This patch requires a new game to work! If you already had DAC0DA installed before adding this patch, it will do exactly nothing for you. No way around this, I'm afraid.**

There are several different plugins to choose from, ranging from the simple level requirements to more complicated requirements like having finished certain quests beforehand (more to come in the future updates).
  
  
**All plugins are ESL flagged and will not contribute towards your load order!**

 
  
  
**LEVEL REQUIREMENTS**
  
These patches are the simplest starting requirement for DAc0da - you must only reach the required level.
  
  
**Level 25:**
  
Numidium will appear once you reach level 25.
  
  
**Level 30:**
  
Numidium will appear once you reach level 30.
  
  
**Level 40:**
  
Numidium will appear once you reach level 40.
  
  
**QUEST REQUIREMENTS**
  
These patches are more complicated than the ones above and will require you to be both at least level 25 (because there needs to be a minimum level - this is not a mod to start unprepared) and finish certain quests before starting DAc0da.
  
  
**Option 1:**
  
- be level 25+
  
- complete The Horn of Jurgen Windcaller
  
- complete The Eye of Magnus
  
- complete Arniel's Endeavour
  
  
**Option 2:**
  
- be level 25+
  
- complete The Horn of Jurgen Windcaller
  
- complete The Eye of Magnus
  
- complete Arniel's Endeavour
  
- complete Yngol's Barrow
  
  
**Option 3:**
  
- be level 25+
  
- complete The Horn of Jurgen Windcaller
  
- complete The Eye of Magnus
  
- complete Arniel's Endeavour
  
- complete Yngol's Barrow
  
- complete Discerning the Transmundane
  
- complete The Mind of Madness
  
  
**Option 4:**
  
- be level 25+
  
- complete The Horn of Jurgen Windcaller
  
- complete The Eye of Magnus
  
- complete Arniel's Endeavour
  
- complete Yngol's Barrow
  
- complete Discerning the Transmundane
  
- complete The Mind of Madness
  
- complete Legends Lost (requires Sunder and Wraithguard CC)
  
  
**Option 5 (recommended for best story integration):**
  
- be level 25+
  
- complete The Horn of Jurgen Windcaller
  
- complete The Eye of Magnus
  
- complete Arniel's Endeavour
  
- complete Yngol's Barrow
  
- complete Discerning the Transmundane
  
- complete The Mind of Madness
  
- complete Legends Lost (requires Sunder and Wraithguard CC)
  
- complete Dreams of the Dead (requires Gallows Hall CC)
  
  
**NOTES ON QUEST REQUIREMENTS (SPOILERS):**
  
Spoiler
  

  
* level 25 is one I found to be the sweet spot to start DAc0da at absolute earliest; anything lower and you may have issues ... but a lot obviously depends on your modded setup
while DAc0da does not strictly demand that your character must be the Dragonborn to play through it, you'll have more content if they are and it does demand the Prisoner (which is, in very short and a bit innacurate, the designated Hero of each game ... which just so happens to be the LDB for Skyrim), hence the Horn of Jurgen Windcaller (to be officially recognized as the Dragonborn)
  
* The Eye of Magnus is the finale of the College of Winterhold questline, and since DAc0da involves the Psijics contacting your character for help with the Numidium, it only makes sense to already be familiar with them
Arniel's Endeavour involves Keening and Arniel trying to recreate the disappearance of the Dwemer (the fool) and DAc0da does touch on that topic, as well, along with Kagrenac, his philosophy and briefly the importance of his tools 
  
* one side quest in DAc0da involves the events in Atmora around the time of Ysgramor and his 500 Companions sailing off to Skyrim to take revenge on the Snow Elves, and what may or may not have happened to Yngol - Yngol's Barrow is a nice tie-in here (and yes, there is a quest, you just won't see it in your journal, but clearing the dungeon will do the trick)
Discerning the Transmundane is Hermaeus Mora's quest which involves a Dwemer safe and what is (not) inside it ... but there's another reason why this quest should be completed, and it'll be very obvious as you play through DAc0da 
  
* The Mind of Madness is Sheogorath's quest and DAc0da includes him - but where, I'll let you figure out on your own
since we already have a quest dealing witk Keening as a pre-requisite, it's only fair to include the other two Kagrenac's Tools as well - which is why Legends Lost slots in neatly here (Sunder & Wraithguard CC)
  
* Dreams of the Dead may seem an odd one here, but this quest includes retrieval of some items of a certain infamous necromancer who has quite a role in one side quest in DAc0da (Gallows Hall CC)
  
  
**ADJUSTING LEVEL REQUIREMENTS**
  
If you are not happy with any of the offered starting level options, you can easily adjust that part of the patch to your own taste. To do so, do the following:
  
Spoiler
  

  
* open DAc0da- Delayed Start.esp in xEdit and expand it
expand Global section
  
* click on entry zDcdGStartLevel
change entry Value to whatever level you want the mod to be available to start at (e.g. 10, if you're very brave)
  
* see this image if you need help:
