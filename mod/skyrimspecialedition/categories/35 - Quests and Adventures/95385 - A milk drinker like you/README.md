**What the Mod Does**
  
Adds a dialogue option to ensure combat when a Taunting Adventurer asks "What's a milk drinker like you doing out here?  Go home to your mother."
  
  
Now, your options will be:
  

  
* **It's better to be a milk drinker than a dung eater!**
You shouldn't talk that way to me.
  
* I'll be going now.

  
If you select the "You shouldn't talk that way to me", you will get asked, what are going to do cry?
  
At this point you have the following replies:
  

  
* Back off. Now. (intimidate)
Listen, I don't want any trouble (Persuade).
  
* **Fine, let's get this over with, unnamed dead person number... oh I've lost count << suggested by LeanWolf**

  
  
  
**Why this is needed**
  
At higher levels, the Dovahkiin will always pass either the Intimidate check or the Persuasion check, resulting in the Taunting Adventurer safely walking away.
  
  
This should not be.
