In the base game you really only have 3 options in dealing with Mogrul.
  
  
1: Pay him off
  
  
2: Kill him
  
  
3: Ignore him and have his thugs after you forever.
  
  
  
Given his criminal behavior towards not just you. But other citizens of Ravenrock as well. It always seemed odd to me it was impossible to have him arrested. Well now you can, it's just a little difficult.
  
  
 If Mogrul's thugs attack you and you find his note on their body. You can show it to Second Councilor Adril. However Adril wont consider it serious evidence unless he trusts you completely. After all anyone could have written it. However if you've completed "Served Cold." Which is the final quest in Ravenrock's questline. He'll listen to you and have Mogrul arrested.
  
  
Alternatively if you're a master of Illusion magic. You can convince Mogrul you've already paid him off.
  
  
You can also use the "Bend Will shout" to force him to pay you 1000 septims instead. Or if you have a speech level close to 100 you can convince him to drop the whole thing. Here's a video showing the mod off.
