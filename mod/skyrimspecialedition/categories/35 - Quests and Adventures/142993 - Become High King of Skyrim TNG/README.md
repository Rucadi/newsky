**BECOME HIGH KING OF SKYRIM: TNG V2**

Long has the throne of Skyrim been shaped by war, politics, and blood. But in the frozen north, a hidden realm awakens beneath the mountain peaks: Highreach Keep,a secret kingdom governed by ancient rites and waiting for the one bold enough to seize its power.
  
  
**Become High King of Skyrim: TNG V2** is a complete rebuild of the classic mod, expanded into a full political and kingdom-management overhaul. Featuring a massive new city, thousands of lines of voiced dialogue, original music, a fully operational royal council, dynamic governance, trials, decrees, faith systems, economic simulation, and branching storylines, this mod transforms Skyrim into a living kingdom you rule.
  
  
BHKS: TNG will change your game. It will change your choices. And every playthrough will forge a different reign.

**Features**

  
  
**A New Kingdom: Highreach City - the ancient but forgotten seat of power in Skyrim**
  
A fully realized new worldspace built deep within the Jerrall Mountains, featuring custom architecture, a city district, palace complex, throne room, council chambers, dungeons, mines, a treasury vault, and an original soundtrack. Highreach Keep is the heart of your kingdom and evolves with your rule.
  
  
**The Royal Council**
  
Recruit a fully voiced court of advisors—each with unique quests, mechanics, and responsibilities—and govern Skyrim through nine interconnected systems:
  
  
• Grand Advisor - Surgus of the Black will guide you on your rule
  
• Royal Spouse - Marry either Ulfric of Elisif and forge a dynasty
  
• Master of Coin – Economy, taxation, treasury, income reports
  
• Will of the Crown – Infrastructure, decrees, expenses, construction systems
  
• High Priest – Faith across the nine holds, sermons, envoys, inquisitors
  
• Master of Chains – Arrests, trials, sentencing, prisons, justice mechanics
  
• First Mage – Mystical systems, new spells, unlock mages in the army
  
• Voice of the Crown – Diplomacy, propaganda, public persuasion, trade policy
  
• Royal Chronicler – Documents your reign in a dynamically written chronicle
  
• Master of Assassins – Intelligence, discreet eliminations, rebellion suppression
  
• Lord Commander – Army expansion, guard ranks, soldier promotion system
  
• Royal Steward – Hire maids, jester and chef with all original voiced dialogue.
  
• Royal Blacksmith – Endgame armorer and forger of the Steel-Eater's pride armor set
  
• Overseer of Slaves – Strike it rich by mining the precious Aar-Gol from Highreach's mine
  
  
Every advisor reacts to your actions and your rule shapes their stories.
  
  
**Approval Rating**
  
Each hold maintains its own Approval score, influenced by taxes, decrees, punishments, infrastructure, faith, and your personal decisions. High approval unlocks obedience and authority; low approval leads to unrest, rebellion, and political instability.
  
  
**Faith & the Church of Skyrim**
  
Track and influence Faith levels throughout the nine holds. Appoint priests, dispatch envoys, deploy inquisitors, consecrate statues, or declare the Church of Skyrim as the official state religion. Faith can shield you from political backlash—or collapse beneath heresy if neglected.
  
  
Construct statues of your player character in cities who declare for the Church of Skyrim and replace Talos as the God of the Nords.
  
  
**Justice & Trials**
  
A full legal system allows you to accuse, arrest, and try NPCs. Bring detainees before your throne, hear charges, review evidence, consider their plea, and pass judgment. Punishments include execution, exile, imprisonment, forced labor, beggar status, or military conscription.
  
  
All trials occur in the Highreach Throne Room.
  
  
**Governance, Decrees & Domain Upgrades**
  
Oversee the kingdom’s infrastructure and laws through a comprehensive management system:
  
  
• Issue decrees affecting law, economy, culture, and faith
  
• Construct and upgrade Skyrim’s watchtowers
  
• Manage hiring of guards, clergy, inquisitors, and administrators
  
• Oversee treasury expenses and minimize waste
  
• Improve hold conditions through global infrastructure planning
  
  
**Magic, Warfare & Mystics**
  
Shape Highreach’s mystical authority through unique spells, systems, and the nine Rule-Stones. Train and rank soldiers with the robust Promotion System—each battlefield kill earns soldiers new abilities, armor upgrades, and elite status.
  
  
**NPC Commands**
  
Exert your will across Skyrim with ruler-exclusive commands:
  
  
• Bow, kneel, or express loyalty (approval-gated)
  
• Dance or relinquish possessions (approval-gated)
  
• Select a romantic partner (approval-gated)
  
• Make any NPC a follower with full support framework
  
• Shout citizens to death—if the main quest is completed
  
  
**Highreach Keep & Royal Home**
  
Your personal palace includes a luxurious royal quarters, fully voiced staff (once hired), adoption support with Hearthfire Multiple Adoption compatibility, treasury vault with visual gold piles that change with wealth, armory and display room, council chambers, dining hall, and customizable décor. A fully functioning capital to match your reign.
  
  
**Merchant’s Guild & Economy**
  
Drop-off chests located around Highreach allow you to deposit goods for sale. Guild couriers collect your items and return gold directly. Economy, taxes, expenses, and prosperity levels are managed through the Master of Coin’s systems.
  
  
**Take your Rule on the Road**
  
With the Voice of the Crown you can now rule from The Blue Palace, Dragonsreach, Palace of the Kings or Understone Keep. Some features are limited when away from Highreach.
