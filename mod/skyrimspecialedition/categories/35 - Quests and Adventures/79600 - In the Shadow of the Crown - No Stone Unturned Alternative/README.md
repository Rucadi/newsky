**Overview**
  
Haven't you sometimes wished you could complete the [No Stone Unturned](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:No_Stone_Unturned) quest without involving the Thieves Guild? Well, now you can! In this version, you visit Ri'saad and ask him to appraise the Unusual Gem for you. Most of the quest is completed exactly as you would the original, with the distinction that you only deal with Ri'saad instead of Vex. 
  
  
  
**Version 1.5 Available**
  
Version 1.5 fixes an issue where the quest fails as soon as you pick up the Crown of Barenziah and then restarts the **No Stone Unturned** quest, pointing you to Vex. You should be able to upgrade to this version from version 1.4 without any issues. 
  
  
  
**Version 1.4 Comments**
  
In the previous version 1.3, it was possible to keep removing and re-adding the Stones to your inventory and get the counter to increase the number of Stones you found. Meaning the quest would show you had found 24 Stones, although in reality you had much less. This version fixes that issue. It is now no longer possible to "fool" the quest. The quest Stone counter only increases if you actually find a real Stone, and no manner of unloading or reloading the Stones from your inventory will change that.
  
  
  
**Features**
  
- Ri'saad is fully voiced using [xVASynth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44184)﻿
  
- The individual Stones of Barenziah come with map markers
  
- Upon completion, you receive **Barenziah's Blessing** instead of **Prowler's Profit** (except for the name, there's no difference)
  
- Option to complete the quest either with Ri'saad or as usual with the Thieves Guild
  
- If you complete the quest with Ri'saad, the crown will still appear in the Thieves Guild
  
- If you decide to complete the quest through Vex in the Thieves Guild, **In the Shadow of the Crown** will automatically fail.
  
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
I've checked, and it seems this mod is compatible with the following mods:
  
  
- [Thieves Guild For Good Guys - Taking Care of Business Redux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10745) 
  
- [Destroy the Thieves Guild](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43244) 
  
  
In either case, the same rules apply. You can only do the Barenziah quest via Ri'saad if you're not participating in the Thieves Guild.
  
  
  
**FAQ**
  
**Q:** How do I start the quest?
  
**A:** The quest starts automatically as soon as you pick up one of the Unusual Gems.
  
  
**Q:** What if I change my mind and decide to complete the quest with the Thieves Guild?
  
**A:** Ri'saad will give you the option to think about continuing with him or completely end his quest and go with the Thieves Guild. But if at any point you decide to continue with the Thieves Guild's **No Stone Unturned** quest, **In the Shadow of the Crown** will automatically fail.
  
  
**Q:** Is there a point of no return where I can no longer complete the quest with the Thieves Guild?
  
**A:** Yes, as soon as you have collected all 24 Stones of Barenziah, you can no longer complete the quest with the Thieves Guild. When you have reached that point, the Thieves Guild quest is stopped. On the other hand, if at any point you continue with **No Stone Unturned**, Ri'saad's quest (i.e. **In the Shadow of the Crown**) will automatically fail.
  
  
**Q:** Can I install the mod during an existing game?
  
**A:** Yes, and if you already have one or more of the Unusual Gems in your inventory when you install the mod, the quest will start immediately as soon as you continue your game. 
  
  
  
**Installation/Uninstallation**
  
As always, please use a mod manager such as Vortex to install or uninstall this mod. I prefer Mod Organizer 2. If you must install manually, then move the files into the Data folder of your Skyrim SE installation. To uninstall manually, remove the files from the Data folder. If you're using the Loose Files version, good luck with that.
