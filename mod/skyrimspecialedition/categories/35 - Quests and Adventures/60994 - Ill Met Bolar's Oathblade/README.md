# Ill Met Bolar's Oathblade
- Author: lilebonymace
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60994
**Description**
  
Allows you to acquire [Bolar's Oathblade](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Bolar%27s_Oathblade) during (or after) the [Ill Met By Moonlight](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ill_Met_By_Moonlight) quest as well. Without this mod the blade disappears when the quest starts and (according to UESP) may appear again only after a month. With this mod the blade is always there, waiting for you to take it.
  
  
**Compatibility**
  

  
* [Quest Conflict Fixes](https://www.afkmods.com/index.php?/files/file/2295-quest-conflict-fixes/) includes a similar edit, you don't need both.
Compatible with everything else that doesn't change the location of the blade (so probably with everything).
