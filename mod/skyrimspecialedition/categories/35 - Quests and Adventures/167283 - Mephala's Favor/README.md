This mod adds a small cult of Mephala to the Rift. You can join them as soon as you find the cave, but they'll be more respectful if you've completed "The Whispering Door." 
  
  
If you sided with the Vigilants of Stendarr, in JaySerpa's overhaul of the quest. They will not be pleased and try to murder you. Which will lock you out of basically all the mod's content, but like what did you expect? If you wipe out the cult you can convert the cave into a shine of Stendarr. Otherwise you'll be able to make offerings to Mephala in return for new perks. The perks are deliberately much weaker then Vanilla perks as they don't cost normal perk points. You unlock them making offerings to Mephala. 
  
  
  
To unlock each perk point you must offer:
  
  
-10 Vials of Frostbite spider venom
  
-10 Spider eggs
  
- One filled Black Soul Gem
  
- One filled Grand soul Gem
  
- 1 Daedra Heart 
  
- 1 human Heart 
  
- 3 pieces of human flesh
  
- 4 pieces of Ebony ore
  
  
Once you have all of that you can make an offering at the Cauldron to get a perk point. Then repeat the process for each additional perk you wish to unlock. There are a total of 14 perks.

The new spells in question are all poison or spider themed. You can learn to conjure vials of poison to coat your weapons with and summon the more impressive Daedric spiders by completing Mephala's ritual enough times. You can also learn to summon lesser spiders by buy spell tomes from the Alchemist. The shrine also features two merchant. You can sleep there, but it's not much of player home.
