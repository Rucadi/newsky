Ghosts of the Tribunal is undeniably Bethesda's true love letter to Morrowind fans, with both new and returning items that stay faithful to original Morrowind design. Come with it is also a rather well thought out questline involved a cult of the old Tribunal, offering players a choice to wipe them all, or help them out and rebuild. The problem with this questline, like most contents that come with Creation Club, is the whole story was being told entirely through notes and books in game with no new voice acting, and what we ended up having are husks of NPC that we couldn't care less about. With ElevenLabs and some restless nights, I want to amend this content by bringing you Voiced Narrative - Ghosts of the Tribunal.[/left]
  
[left]**Feature:**- New greeting lines for the occupants of Ashfall's Tear; almost everyone will have something to say about themselves (or praise Almalexia!) outside of the questline.
  
- Overused generic lines have been replaced with new ones that better reflect each character’s personality and the overall narrative.
  
- All new lines were written with careful consideration of existing lore and notes from the content, most are throwback to TES3: Morrowind, nothing should feel too overdone.
  
- Voiced lines were generated with ElevenLabs. Many hours were spent experimenting lines repeatedly to hand-pick the most natural-sounding deliveries with the right expression for each context.[/left]

**FAQ:**
  
**Is this ESL-flagged (ESPFE)?**
  
Yes.
  
  
**Is this compatible with Unofficial Skyrim Creation Club Content Patches?**
  
Yes.
  
**[b]I noticed some grammar errors and thought a few lines could be improved?**
  
[/b]I'm always open to any feedback on improving dialogue and grammar**,**but please provide helpful feedback over one-liner criticism.
  
**Is this compatible with my face overhaul mod that change the same NPCs from this mod?**
  
Yes, it only changes dialogue records, NPCs are left intact.
  
  
**Will this break my save?**
  
This mod mainly edited dialogue records that already existed. It's safe to install mid game; removing it will just revert everything back to vanilla lines.
