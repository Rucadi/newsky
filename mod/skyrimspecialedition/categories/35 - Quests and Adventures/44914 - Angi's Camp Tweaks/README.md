Description
  
  
Major changes to Angi's Camp / Archery Practice (dunArcherQST):
  

  
* Completing Angi's challenges now gives flat XP bonuses that scale with the challenge difficulty (2400 XP in total).
You can continue to ask Angi for Practice Arrows when you're running low after completing her challenges.
  
* You can continue to gain a small amount of XP from practicing at the target range. (Make sure to use the Practice Arrows!)
Practice Arrows will automatically re-spawn by the target range if you are about to run out.
  

  
Minor changes:
  

  
* Angi will no longer react to you (e.g. "Be careful!") when firing your bow.
Angi will hit the far target accurately when demonstrating (may only affect new games). You may still notice arrows teleporting upwards after they collide; this is an unavoidable issue with how the engine handles AI aiming.
  
* Angi will correctly start with the middle target and not skip the right target during the final demonstration.
Angi will consider you a friend after completing the first challenge. You will become an enemy if you threaten her, so don't pick that option if you're planning to use the Ebony Blade.
