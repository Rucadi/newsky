Bittercup wasn't my favorite addition at first, it didn't seem like something Creation Club could really do justice to in terms of lore. But after giving it another go and dissecting its content, I found the questline has surprisingly deep branching. Beneath its stories lies a focused theme of fate and paths intertwined, but it is hindered by the overuse of generic vanilla lines. Using that theme as a foundation, I've tried to enhance the narrative by giving unique voiced lines generated by ElevenLabs to its characters, bringing out the good story hidden behind the notes and turning it into personalities that players can directly interact with. 
  
  
**Feature:**
  
- New greeting lines for NPCs added by Bittercup: Rulnik, Cuinanthil, Inimoro.
  
- Unique combat initiation lines for Neski Skull-Sabre and the Orc Pit Fighter in the Power branch.
  
- Overused generic lines have been replaced with new ones that better reflect each character's personality and the overall narrative. The Fortune branch adds more dynamic to the titular "fortunate son" and the steadfast bodgyguard caught in their crossfire, while the Nothing branch gives some personality to the character of Rulnik Wind-Strider, who has become a tad philosophical after his near-death experience.
  
- All new lines were written with careful consideration of existing lore and notes from the content, nothing should feel too overdone.
  
- Voiced lines were generated with ElevenLabs. Many hours were spent experimenting lines repeatedly to hand-pick the most natural-sounding deliveries with the right expression for each context.

**FAQ:**
  
**Is this ESL-flagged (ESPFE)?**
  
Yes.
  
  
**Is this compatible with Unofficial Skyrim Creation Club Content Patches?**
  
Yes.
  
**[b]I noticed some grammar errors and thought a few lines could be improved?**
  
[/b]I'm always open to any feedback on improving dialogue and grammar**,**but please provide helpful feedback over one-liner criticism.
  
**Is this compatible with my face overhaul mod that change the same NPCs from this mod?**
  
Yes, it only changes dialogue records, NPCs are left intact.
  
  
**Will this break my save?**
  
This mod mainly edited dialogue records that already existed. It's safe to install mid game; removing it will just revert everything back to vanilla lines.
