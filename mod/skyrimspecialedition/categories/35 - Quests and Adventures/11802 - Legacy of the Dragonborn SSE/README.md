[color=#ffd966]Legacy of the Dragonborn V6[/color]![](https://i.imgur.com/DgtX0Wv.png)

  
 ﻿Long have the jaws of Oblivion been bound closed, yet there are those who would seek to pry open the maw of destruction once more to meet their nefarious ends. The long shattered heart of an empire has come to the lands of Skyrim’s strife, and waits for one who is bound to it to once again make it whole. 
  
  
 ﻿Legacy of the Dragonborn is one of the most acclaimed expansion sized mods for Skyrim which offers without equal; the most versatile, most expansive and most extensive display space for artifacts the Elder Scrolls series has ever seen! On top of offering a Museum for display of nearly 4600 potential unique items and sets (including supported mods), this mod offers an entirely new guild faction you start from the ground up, “The Explorer’s Society”. It offers dozens of new quest, a handful of major quest arcs and numerous useful and unique mechanics all centered around your home at the Dragonborn Gallery in Solitude.
  
 
  
 ﻿Legacy is designed as a foundational mod to build your load order and entire playthrough around. It is recommended that you START your game with this mod  and all chosen supported mods and patches already installed and ready to go. Legacy will change the way you look at Skyrim, change the way you play the  game and give you cause and reason for doing everything you do as the Dragonborn. The museum not only offers display space for your loot, but also tracks various accomplishments with detailed displays, shows what you have achieved and where you have been. 
  
  
 ﻿As the story of the mod is designed around the canonical aspect of the player being the Dragonborn, it will potentially break some immersion to otherwise play as a non-Dragonborn. The main quest of Legacy centers around it and depends upon certain vanilla quests establishing you as such. 
  
  
Download today and see why so many people are saying “I don’t play Skyrim anymore, I play Legacy of the Dragonborn”.

Features

Dragonborn Gallery - A massive museum graces the capital of Solitude (right next to the blue palace), which houses space for over 4500 possible artifacts, quest displays and more from vanilla, Legacy and supported mods.
  
  
The Safehouse - A fully equipped player home with all the amenities you could ever want with every crafting station available plus custom disenchanting station, soul gem transmorgraphier, soul extractor, archeology station, replica workbench and more. Space for a family and an entourage is available for purchase at Bits and Pieces, as well as options for a greenhouse and luxury patio. Top it off with display storage that makes a home feel lived in and a hidden treasury and more, the safehouse becomes a display piece all its own.
  
  
Craftloot - An intelligent crafting system that stores all your crafting resources locally and puts them all into your inventory on activating one of the crafting stations. A spell is also available to access your crafting storage at will from anywhere. Craftloot can be enabled to function anywhere in the world!
  
  
Hundreds of New Relics - Legacy adds a massive array of relics and collections to the game as well as provides unique meshes and textures to virtually every unique item in the game.
  
  
A Complex Questline - The true destiny of the Dragonborn comes to light in an extensive main questline that seeks to bring together relics from those tied to the two aspects of the Chim-El Adabal; Lorkhan and Akatosh. This completely rewritten quest allows those who played in the past to play anew with new foes, new paths and new outcomes.
  
  
The Explorers Guild - Bored of the same guilds in Skyrim? We've got you covered. With a brand new Guild you establish yourself known as the Explorer Society. Recruit members, setup expeditions and take advantage of the Guild member's unique skills. All culminating in 3 massive expedition quests with tricky boss battles and breath-taking set pieces.
  
  
Maximum Compatibility - Legacy provides a FOMOD patch installer, available at [Legacy Patch Central](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30980) which will detect all mods you have activated in your load order and recommend which patches are needed.
  
  
Automatic Display Sorting - If you'd rather not wander through the Gallery looking for the display spot for your new treasures, the curator's office features an auto-sorter which will scan your inventory and display any items you've collected. This updated system works faster than ever before, only looking for groups of items you have in your inventory rather than running the full list.
  
  
Replica Crafting - Want to use that powerful relic you found? Well don't deprive the museum of a display, make a replica of it today!
  
  
A New Skill (Archaeology) - as you discover more of the hundreds of dig sites dotted around Skyrim you will advance levels in Archaeology allowing you to turn your fragments into new and interesting relics. Some with special abilities and others just for show. Archaeology also has 3 new perk trees, which are independent of the Skyrim perk system for maximum compatibility!
  
  
Fossil Excavating -Find fossils in mining nodes and at specialize fossil beds in the hot springs tundra to create new amazing natural science displays.
  
  
Museum shipment crates - Too much loot? Setup delivery crates from the curator's office. This station will let you enable crates next to the carriage drivers, at vanilla and BYOH player homes as well as outside of Inns. Enable in any combination you like or none at all. Placing items inside of them will ship the items back to the museum in a few days.
  
  
**And much more to discover...****[size=4][color=#f4f4f4][size=6]Getting Started In Game

[/size]![](https://i.imgur.com/DgtX0Wv.png)
  
[/size][/color]**Joining the museum can happen a number of ways; You can wander in to the museum and be sent to find 3 items for the curator to prove yourself, you can bring 3 or more unique items you previously found and provide them to the museum to join immediately, you can discover a notice in a local tavern or sell a relic and get a letter from the curator, both of which lead in to either finding the 3 preset items or giving him items you have with you. Alternately if you are using the Alternate Start Live Another Life mod, and choose the Solitude dock start option, you will be prompted if you have come to Solitude to be the museum's relic hunter and get an immediate lead in for joining the museum. There is also a custom addon for LAL called Relic hunter: Guildmaster Start which allows you start the game with the explorer's guild already built and established (not recommended for first time playthroughs with Legacy as you miss out on some content).
  
  
Additionally[size=5] it is worth noting and understanding that Legacy is NOT a mod designed for you to play the content entirely through from start to end with it as your only focus. It is designed to run as a foundation along side your entire game. Quests are designed to bread crumb you into discovering additional vanilla and modded content within your game and as you progress through your playthrough and expand your displays, special events and more involved quest arcs with fully encompassed stories with beginning, middle and end will become available. Expect to be sent to discover new items and find additional content along the way. Pace yourself and enjoy the journey.
