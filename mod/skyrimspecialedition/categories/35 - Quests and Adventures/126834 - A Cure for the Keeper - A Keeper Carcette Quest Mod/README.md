Keeper Carcette's death never made sense to me, you can go the hall of the vigilant and very easily see her dead body isn't there, this is my solution a very short quest mod where you discover Keeper Carcette is alive as a vampire.
  
  
To start the quest talk to Mralki in Rorikstead anytime after you have completed Awakening.
  
  
To get the best ending it is recommend your character knows the cure to Vampirism.
  
  
Version 1.1 Update:
  
  
You can now persuade carcette to embrace being a vampire if you are one yourself, have a speech skill of 50 and choose the right dialogue options.
  
  
The cured Carcette or Vampire Carcette can be obtained as followers and restoration traienrs depending on your quest choices.
  
  
Cured Carcette can be found at Stendarr's Beacon. Vampire Carcette can be made a follower as soon as you complete the quest and will take residence at the shrine of stendarr near to the location you initially find her.
  
  
  
At this point I consider the mod finished, though will still fix any bugs I am made aware of.
  
  
Patches:
  
  
Keeper Carcette Survives Patch, makes it so the keeper carcette enabled by the good ending is Carcette the survivor, as a side effect this fixes the default issue keeper carcette survives has where there are two carcettes at the beginning of the game  (and also gives vampire carcette a scar so the scar she has carcette the survivor makes sense)
  
  
Stendarr Rising - Carcette Returns Patch, makes it so Carcette only returns if you completed the good ending of the quest, and disables the cured keeper carcette after you meet the requirement for keeper carcette to return to hall of the vigilants. (the pre-repair cured carcette has been removed from the marriage and follower factions to prevent issues)
  
  
The above two patches don't work together, Keeper Carcette Survives, Carcette Returns patch enable all three mods to work together and only have one Carcette enabled at a time.
