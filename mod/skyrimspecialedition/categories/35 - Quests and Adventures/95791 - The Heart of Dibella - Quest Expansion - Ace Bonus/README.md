[JaySerpa](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5201727)﻿'s latest quest expansion adds - among other things - an option to choose how the [Agent of Dibella](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Powers#Agent_of_Dibella)﻿ perk will function, based on your character's interests.
  
  
In vanilla, the perk gives a 10% melee damage bonus to the opposite sex. In the quest expansion, this can optionally be altered to instead affect the same sex (for gay characters) or to be a 5% bonus to both sexes (for bisexual characters).
  
  
You're also given the option to express your asexuality - however, the result is receiving no bonus at all.
  
  
While of course it's nice to at least have an option to express it, the fact that it locks you out of receiving any sort of bonus and was therefore effectively something of a "bad option" was a bit of a bummer to me. So I made this simple patch.
  
  
Now, if you've previously told Mother Hamal you're asexual, once you've received the Agent of Dibella perk, you'll take 5% less melee damage - in direct contrast with the other variations which instead increase the damage you deal.

Flagged as ESL.
  
  
Let me know if there's any issues.
