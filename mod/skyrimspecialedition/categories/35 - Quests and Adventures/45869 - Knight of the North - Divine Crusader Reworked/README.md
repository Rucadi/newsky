Knight of the North is a quest overhaul for the [Divine Crusader](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/details/5666/Divine_Crusader_)﻿ Creation. In the vanilla quest, you find the Divine Crusader Armor with some bandits in Four Skull Lookout. In Knight of the North, Sir Areldur, a Knight of the Nine fearing Thalmor prosecution for the order's Talos worship, brought the Crusader's Relics north and hid them with devoted servants of the Divines. Now, take up the cause of the Knights and reunite the Crusader's Relics once more!

* A completely reworked quest for obtaining the Relics of the Crusader.
Travel far and wide to hunt down the Relics across the province.
  
* An interesting background narrative that explains how the Relics got to Skyrim.
A reworked Infamy system that is less harsh and more transparent about what misdeed the gods will punish you for.
  
* New ways to check how the gods feel about your worthiness to wield the Relics of the Crusader.

  
**Honor**

In the vanilla Divine Crusader Creation once you had collected all the Relics you will be monitored to see if you commit any crimes. Once you commit even a single crime [The Pilgrim's Path](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Pilgrim%27s_Path)﻿ will begin and you will get massive debuffs for attempting to use any Crusader Relics. This is more or less how Oblivion handles these items, but I found it to not translate as well without a visibly tracked Fame and Infamy stat.
  
  
To address this, I've replaced the Creation's implementation with a new system called **Honor**. This is a stat that can be tracked in the Magic Passives window similar to how Survival Mode stats are tracked, however it is only visible if you have a Crusader Relic on your person. Honor is not tracked until after the **Relics of the Crusader** quest is finished. Reuniting the Relics is considered to be a very honorable endeavor, so you will begin at maximum Honor regardless of any misdeed preformed in your past. However, this may change depending on how you approach certain parts of the **Relics of the Crusader** quest.
  
  
There are six ranks of Honor, you lose honor by committing crimes (some things may cost more Honor than others):
  
  

  
* **Peerless** - Your honor is peerless, and you are undoubtedly fit to wield the Crusader's Relics.
**Respected** - You are respected for your honor. You are fit to wield the Crusader's Relics.
  
* **Questioned** - Your honor is questioned by rumors of your misdeeds. Some doubt you are fit to wield the Crusader's Relics.
**Tarnished** - Your honor is tarnished from your crimes. You are almost unfit to wield the Crusader's Relics.
  
* **Disgraced** - You are clinging to the remaining shreds of your honor. Committing any crimes will render you unfit to wield the Crusader's Relics.
**Infamous** - You are dishonored and unfit to wield the Crusader's Relics.
  

  
Once you hit the Infamous rank [The Pilgrim's Path](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Pilgrim%27s_Path) will trigger and you will need to perform a Pilgrimage in order to absolve yourself and again become fit to wield the Crusader Relics. This quest has not been edited, only the means of triggering it.

Knight of the North is designed to be as compatible as possible while still achieving its goals. No dialogue or quests (aside from Divine Crusader's) have been directly edited.
  
  
There are a number of minor additions to a few interiors and overworld locations in order to redistribute Relics. While these edits have been designed to be as compatible as possible, you will probably need a patch for anything that effects Stendarr's Beacon.
  
  
Both this mod and [The Heart of Dibella - Quest Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/94863) edit the same script. In order to maintain compatibility, JaySerpa has forwarded my changes, so everything will work correctly without a patch!
