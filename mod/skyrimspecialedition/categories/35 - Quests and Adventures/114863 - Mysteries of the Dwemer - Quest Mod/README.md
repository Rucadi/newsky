**Mysteries of the Dwemer**

**Introduction:**
  
Mysteries of the Dwemer is a mod centred around one NPC, Maro, a researcher of the Dwemer. He'll appear outside multiple Dwarven ruins and will explain parts of the Deep Folk's history in a digestible and interesting way for the player. As these encounters progress, he'll speak more and more of the race as a whole and eventually, how he believes they disappeared. This mod sticks heavily to TES lore and doesn't attempt to offer any definitive answers, so don't worry about any non-lore-friendly content.
  
  
**Features****:**
  

  
* **Unique questline.** A quest explaining various parts of Dwemer lore in an interesting format has never been done in Skyrim and should offer a different experience to all players, regardless of their knowledge on the race. It will also delve into some conversations rife with opportunities for your character to have a true voice and express themselves, with many lines of dialogue acknowledging your choice, and some you may have made in the past.

  
* **[size=2][b]Interesting NPC.**[/b] Maro is much more than a glorified lore dispenser and rather different from many of my other NPCs. He features a rather intriguing facet to him that must be uncovered by digging deep into the TES lore and listening carefully to all he says.[/size]

  
* **Fully voiced.**The mod features extremely high-quality voice acting done by the incredible [MeekVoice](https://www.castingcall.club/meekvoice)﻿, a veteran of Skyrim modding and an class act that really enhances Maro's dialogue!

  
**Showcase:**
  
  
**FAQ:**Can the mod be downloaded mid-game?
  

  
* **Yes, it's completely fine to install mid-game.**

* **It is thanks to CharderoTheLupe!**

Is the mod clean?
  

  
* **Yes, I have only edited the necessary cells, there should be no conflicts due to dirty edits.**

How do I start the quest?
  

  
* **You need to visit Mzulft and find him on the way up.**

He's just sitting there after I said goodbye, is that normal?
  

  
* **Yep! Just wait a few hours and the quest will progress.**

How can I find him?
  

  
* **You can look for him at the various Dwemer ruins, or you can just use the provided locations on the mod page. I won't be replying to questions asking on where he goes next.**

Can I make a patch for the mod?
  

  
* **I'd love if people made patches for any incompatibilities that arise, if** **you could send these to me I'll upload them onto the mod page**

Can it be ported to Xbox?
  

  
* **[size=2]The original porter who would do all of my mods can no longer do it. If you're up to it and agree to give credit along with including my showcases on the page, I have no problems with you porting it.**[/size]
