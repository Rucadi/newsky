Relic Hunter- Guildmaster Start
  
  
This addon pack for Legacy of the Dragonborn and Alternate Start - Live Another Life allows you to begin a new game as the guild master for the explorer's society. You start at the site of a small excavation of some Akaviri ruins with several explorer relic tools already at your disposal to get you going as a true relic hunter! The explorer's society and membership recruitment will already be established in this new start, allowing you access to all the benefits and features it has to offer.
  
  
[color=#ffffff]What you get with this addon:
  
- Dwemer Compass from start
  
- Schnieder's Sextant from start
  
- Big Deano's Pack from start
  
- Alvaro's Tools from start
  
- Explorer armor (heavy or light)
  
- Explorer's guild established
  
- Explorer members recruited
  
- New Guild Master Start for AS-LAL
  
- New small dungeon and start game intro quest
  
- New relic to display[/color]
  
  
The ruins quest is only available when using the new AS-LAL guild master start but the ruins itself is accessible upon discovery using any start including the original Relic Hunter dockside start.
  
  
Installation and Use
  
  
- Download and install [Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802) (and all required patches)
  
- Download and install [Alternate Start Live Another Life](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/272/)- Download and install Relic Hunter
  
- Place Relic Hunter in your load order AFTER the two above mods.

Alternately you can start the game any other way and still discover and explore the ruins, you just don't get the intro quest or the explorer tools/armor.
