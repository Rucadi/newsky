Before you can claim Bloodchill Manor, there is a short quest that lets you attend a banquet thrown by its late owner and mingle with its guests. These guests are later revealed to be here not by coincidence, however, and the party turned out to be a bloody memorable one. This quest was a very special moment for me when I first played it because I thought it was really good of the author that they managed to tell a story without access to new voice acting, and that perhaps something can be done more to give more personality to these characters. And that was what gave me inspiration for the Voiced Narrative series: by writing new dialogue for these characters using in-game notes provided by the content's authors as context, and using generative AI voice to keep the original voice actors/actresses as a way to remain faithful to the game. With this mod, the guests from the banquet will have a little something to say about the situation, improving the narrative of the Creation Club content and provides immersion for players.

**FAQ:**
  
**Is this ESL-flagged (ESPFE)?**
  
Yes.
  
  
**Is this compatible with Unofficial Skyrim Creation Club Content Patches?**
  
Yes.
  
**[b]I noticed some grammar errors and thought a few lines could be improved?**
  
[/b]I'm always open to any feedback on improving dialogue and grammar**,**but please provide helpful feedback over one-liner criticism.
  
**Is this compatible with my face overhaul mod that change the same NPCs from this mod?**
  
Yes, it only changes dialogue records, NPCs are left intact.
  
  
**Will this break my save?**
  
This mod mainly edited dialogue records that already existed. It's safe to install mid game; removing it will just revert everything back to vanilla lines.**If you like this mod, check out my Voiced Narrative series**[![](https://i.imgur.com/fbGwAOH.png)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67053)﻿[![](https://i.imgur.com/o14dXRl.png)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67117)﻿﻿
