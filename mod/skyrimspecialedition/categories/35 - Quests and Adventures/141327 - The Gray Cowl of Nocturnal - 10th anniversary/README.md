~~\* NO! DON'T UPDATE THE MOD FROM SSE VERSION! \*~~

\* UPDATE FROM THE OLD SSE VERSION IS POSSIBLE IN CERTAIN CASES \*

  
  
Even if the base is the same of the SSE version, please don't "update" from SSE if you are midplaying of the quest! Many things were modified, including the main quest and other stuffs. Causes can be vary from the classic CTD to being teleported to wrong location. Read the sticky post in the discussion tab for more details.

\* DESCRIPTION \*

  
For a long time no one claimed the Gray Cowl of Nocturnal. The last one was the Champion of Cyrodiil at the ending days of the Third Era. But what happened after the Oblivion Crisis? Where is the Gray Cowl now? You're a thief and during stealing and pickpocketing items around the world, a vision appears in front of you. The Gray Cowl is calling. The big journey has started... Where will you go now? Many places are awaiting you. Legendary places, mysterious places, ancient places that needs to be cleaned up from the sands of time. The Gray Cowl wants you.
  
  
  

\* RECOMMENDED LEVEL AND SKILLS \*

  
I recommend you to be at least level 15 (Level 10 is the minimum required to trigger the quest. Level 30-35 is perfect to play), and also to have good skill points and perks for sneaking (most important) and pickpocketing (this, can be "tweaked" during gameplay, if you have a good eye). Some bosses are tough, especially those who are related to side quests. The mod can be finished with a barbarian class too, if you want, but thieves/assassins will be fully satisfied at this mod.
  
There are also two addon mods where one let the trigger works only after completing "The Way of the Voice" quest and another one makes the trigger working by touching a bust in the House of the Thief addon (a house I added along the river between Riften and Ivarstead).
  
  
  

\* HOW BIG IS THIS MOD? \*

It's big enough, you can consider this mod as a DLC-sized one. Gameplay time will be between 8-15 and more hours, depending on your class, style of gameplay, etc. Again, i must say, the thieves/assassins will fully enjoy this mod. There are some famous places to visit, two lands, including an island in Coldharbour realm, and a hidden and isolated area of Hammerfell.
  
  
  

\* HOW TO START THE QUEST? \*

Just steal or pickpocket any item when you are at least level 10.
  
Also, there are some addons available to download for alternate methods to trigger the quest.
  
  
  

\* TECHNICAL INFOS \*

  
This mod contains many, many, many new assets like new meshes, new sounds, new textures and new voices. You'll see new dungeons, new houses and new landscapes. All of these 3D assets are made by myself, except for a few things that i will credit to the authors, in the next lines below.
  
This mod is released as ESM. I will appreciate (and i wish too) that other modders, would want to mod my mod, by adding new stuff, like new dungeons, new quests, etc.
  
The load order is not really important, just put it after your last Official DLC (after Dragonborn, for example), and the Unofficial Patches (not so necessary).
  
This mod does NOT require SKSE, SkyUI, neither any other. Although is compatible with them. Just needs an updated version of Skyrim Special Edition.
  
  
  

\* UNINSTALLATION \*

  
UNSUPPORTED. This mod is too big to be uninstalled without issues. You must begin a new gameplay without this mod if you want.
  
  
  

\* COMPATIBILITY? \*

  
This mod should be compatible with everything, except with mods that edits the same cells at the Skyrim worldspace.
  
Please don't make the classic question "Is this mod compatible with... ?". Check the compatibility with your favourite mods by yourself. If some of your preferred mods requires patches, then ask to the authors of this mods. I'll not make any patches for any other mods.
  
***IMPORTANT: If your Skyrim version is 1.5.97.0 then you must install [this](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441)﻿ or otherwise won't works!***
  
  

\* CAN BE USED THIS VERSION AS AN UPDATE OF THE SSE VERSION? \*

  
Please, read the sticky post in the discussion tab for details.
  
  
  

\* CAN THE ALREADY EXISTING MOD PATCHES WORKING WITH THIS VERSION? \*

  
Maybe yes, maybe no! The thing I'm pretty sure, you'll may have an istant CTD if patches are referencing to deleted elements like the Oasis Cave which is replaced with a tiny world space. This includes the translations mod too.
  
The modders who already made the patches have just to check with xEdit if everything and references are ok.
  
For example the Flora mod will have some trees and plants position issues with the new elements I added, expecially in Ben Erai city.
  
The translators have to rework some lines and add new ones.
