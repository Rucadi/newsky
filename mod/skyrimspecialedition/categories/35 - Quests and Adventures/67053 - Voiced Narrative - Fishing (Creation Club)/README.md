**XBOX version also available on Bethesda.net!**
  
  
Fishing added by Anniversary Edition is a nifty addition to Skyrim, with a fun and adorably written questline despite the lack of new voice acting. Still, the reused generic lines simply can't give proper justice to its well thought out characters and questline. With the technology of ElevenLabs and the love for these charming characters, I've brought to you the first mod from the **Voiced Narrative** series.
  
  
**Feature:**
  
- New greeting dialogue for the main cast of Fishing questline: Swims-in-Deep-Water and Viriya, as well as the new NPCs placed in the world by it. It's only fair that they have something to say for themselves outside of the questline.
  
- Overused generic lines have been replaced with new ones that better reflect each character’s personality and the overall narrative.
  
- All new lines were written with careful consideration of existing lore and notes from the content, nothing should feel too overdone.
  
- Voiced lines were generated with ElevenLabs. Many hours were spent experimenting lines repeatedly to hand-pick the most natural-sounding deliveries with the right expression for each context.
  
- As of version 2.2, this mod should be compatible with [Simple Fishing Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/103440). Make sure load order of Fishing - Voiced Narrative is after.

**FAQ:**
  
**Is this ESL-flagged (ESPFE)?**
  
Yes.
  
  
**Difference between this mod and Simple Fishing Overhaul?**
  
While SFO also improves dialogue, it relies on spliced lines which are quite limited for narrative. However, you can use both mods together.
  
  
**Is this compatible with Unofficial Skyrim Creation Club Content Patches?**
  
Yes.
  
**[b]I noticed some grammar errors and thought a few lines could be improved?**
  
[/b]I'm always open to any feedback on improving dialogue and grammar**,**but please provide helpful feedback over one-liner criticism.
  
**Is this compatible with my face overhaul mod that change the same NPCs from this mod?**
  
Yes, it only changes dialogue records, NPCs are left intact.
  
  
**Will this break my save?**
  
This mod mainly edited dialogue records that already existed. It's safe to install mid game; removing it will just revert everything back to vanilla lines.[center]
