In [GLENMORIL](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32998)﻿ you stumble over an orphan outside of Falkreath and in deciding to help her, you soon find yourself faced with strange incidents around Falkreath, elusive organization of witch hunters, a blood curse threat, and an eldritch plan eras in the making ... 
  
  
.͢nóg̡ár͞d͏ ̢́͘e̕l͢t̛͡͡t̷͞i͏́ļ̷̧ ,̷̕҉u͞ǫ̕͝y̨ ̸r͜òf̵̡͞ ̧l̀̀l͟a̷͜ ͝s̡í̢͢ ̷s̴̛i̴h͘͢T̢
  
  
However, GLENMORIL's questline is by default set to start the moment you approach the gates of Falkreath. This can be very jarring, especially since the mod is a sequel to VIGILANT ... and perhaps Dragonborn DLC, too.
  
  
Hence this patch, which will delay its start until certain conditions are met - Brandt and Lalanoah will now not be present outside Falkreath and their scene will not play until then.
  
  
[size=3]With GLENMORIL update 0.96, 2 new quests have been added that are enabled to start asap, but with some rather esoteric requirements, so you will likely not trigger them that quickly. Still, I've opted to delay them in the now recommended option 5 - see it for further info.
  
  
**This patch requires a new game to work! If you already had GLENMORIL installed before adding this patch, it will do exactly nothing for you. No way around this, I'm afraid.**

Until I learn how to make an MCM menu, there will be several different plugins to choose from, ranging from the simple level requirements to more complicated requirements like having finished certain quests beforehand (more to come in the future updates).
  
  
**All plugins are ESL flagged and will not contribute towards your load order!**

**LEVEL REQUIREMENTS**
  
These patches are the simplest starting requirement for Glenmoril - you must only reach the required level.
  
  
**Level 25:**
  
Brandt and Lalanoah will appear outside Falkreath once you reach level 25.
  
  
**Level 30:**
  
Brandt and Lalanoah will appear outside Falkreath once you reach level 30.
  
  
**Level 40:**
  
Brandt and Lalanoah will appear outside Falkreath once you reach level 40.
  
  
**QUEST REQUIREMENTS**
  
These patches are more complicated than the ones above and will require you to be both at least level 25 (because there needs to be a minimum level - this is not a mod to start unprepared) and finish certain quests before starting Glenmoril.
  
  
**Option 1:**
  
- be level 25+
  
- finish Discerning the Transmundane
  
  
**Option 2:**
  
- be level 25+
  
- finish Discerning the Transmundane
  
- finish At the Summit of Apocrypha (finale of the Dragonborn DLC)
  
  
**Option 3:**
  
- be level 25+
  
- finish Discerning the Transmundane
  
- finish At the Summit of Apocrypha (finale of the Dragonborn DLC)
  
- finish Censored Fate (requires Dac0da mod - ending does not matter)
  
- finish Act 4 of Vigilant (requires Vigilant mod - ending does not matter)
  
  
**Option 4:**
  
- be level 25+
  
- finish Discerning the Transmundane
  
- finish At the Summit of Apocrypha (finale of the Dragonborn DLC)
  
- finish Censored Fate (requires Dac0da mod - ending does not matter)
  
- finish Act 4 of Vigilant (requires Vigilant mod - ending does not matter)
  
- finish Sacred Anatomancer (requires Vigilant mod - "divine the future" path is recommended, but any path will do as long as the quest is completed in your journal)
  
  
[size=3]**Option 5 (recommended for best story integration):**
  
  
*For main mod questline:*
  
- be level 25+
  
- finish Discerning the Transmundane
  
- finish Waking Nightmare (Vaermina's Daedric quest)
  
- finish At the Summit of Apocrypha (finale of the Dragonborn DLC)
  
- finish Censored Fate (requires Dac0da mod - ending does not matter)
  
- finish Act 4 of Vigilant (requires Vigilant mod - ending does not matter)
  
- finish Sacred Anatomancer (requires Vigilant mod - "divine the future" path is recommended, but any path will do as long as the quest is completed in your journal)
  
- finish Ghost in the Mirror (Glenmoril dream visitor quest - see below for its requirements)
  
*For meta quest:*
  
- trigger at least 1 space-time fracture 
  
- finish Censored Fate (requires Dac0da mod - ending does not matter)
  
  
*For dream visitor quest:*
  
- be level 25+ OR trigger at least 3 space-time fractures
  
- finish Discerning the Transmundane (Hermaeus Mora's Daedric quest)

- finish Censored Fate (requires Dac0da mod - ending does not matter)
  
- finish Act 4 of Vigilant (requires Vigilant mod - ending does not matter)
  
- finish Sacred Anatomancer (requires Vigilant mod - "divine the future" path is recommended, but any path will do as long as the quest is completed in your journal)
  
- sleep[/size]
  
  
**NOTES ON QUEST REQUIREMENTS (SPOILERS):**
  
Spoiler
  

  
* [size=3]level 25 is one I found to be the sweet spot to start Glenmoril at the absolute earliest; anything lower and you may have issues ... but a lot obviously depends on your modded setup (I'd still recommend a bit higher level since Glenmoril is the sequel to Vigilant and therefore endgame mod)
  
Discerning the Transmundane is important because ... the exact reason why would give away some plot points of Glenmoril, but it becomes pretty obvious very quickly if you just look around and pay attention
  
- At the Summit of Apocrypha is important both because Glenmoril can act as its distant resolution and because of its lore implications (mirror twins, the concept of freedom, a certain Black Book in Miraak's Temple, etc)
Act 4 of Vigilant should be obvious, considering that Glenmoril is the mod's sequel and has many callbacks to it ... and there's a certain NPC in Vigilant that will outright call Act 4 as you trial for the things to come - how you resolve it does not matter, only that you do
  
- Sacred Anatomancer is actually a bridging quest between Vigilant and Glenmoril - it's preferable that you get the "prophecy" resolution, but the other two paths are also acceptable (well, one of them ... the other - be afraid)
being a Dragonborn is not a must, but it almost doesn't make sense not to be, story-wise - some things will simply not make much sense otherwise
  
- I'd almost recommend doing all the Daedric and Divine quests before tackling Glenmoril, especially anything to do with Namira, Vaermina, Clavicus Vile, Hircine, Sheogorath, and Kyne (maybe Mara, too) ... but I'll see about setting them as hard requirements when act 4 is complete
[Wheels of Lull](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/748)﻿ is another recommended mod to finish before Glenmoril, partly because it confirms one idea Vigilant only hinted at and because it throws some of the weirder lore at you ... just in time for Glenmoril to go utterly ham on it before the end
  
[/size]
  
  
**NOTES ON QUEST REQUIREMENTS FOR OPTION 5 (EVEN BIGGER SPOILERS):**Spoiler
  
With update 0.96, a new mechanic has been added to Glenmoril - the mod now remembers some events you trigger and generates a JSON file recording them. Based on the values in this JSON file, you may get different dialogue in certain scenes or even get completely new quests.
  
  
The JSON file is generated with the name of your character (so if you give the character on your next playthrough the same name and still have this file active, they can trigger the new quests and different dialogue sooner) and records the following:
  

  
* how many times you began act 4
how many times you triggered a bad ending in act 2 when the White Owl puts you to sleep
  
* how many times Ja'zel forced reality to reset if you attacked him in acts 1-2
how many times Ja'zel forced reality to reset if you tried to run away from the Witch Hunters at the beginning of act 2
  
* the total sum of the above listed space-time fractures witnessed

  
Yes, it's very similar to how Undertale works. If you're familiar with that and want to "cheat" a little, you can edit this JSON yourself to trigger new quests sooner ... but I do recommend discovering these things naturally.
  
  
At the moment, there are 2 such quests that will trigger.
  
  
**Brain-Billy's Tingling**
  
This is a meta/explanatory quest featuring Rolls-On-Roads and Augur of the Obscure returning from Dac0da. They'll ask for your help with investigating strange space-time anomalies happening in Falkreath, and in addition, you can return to them after every major event in the mod and they'll offer explanations and discussions on events throughout acts 1-2 of Glenmoril, along with several hints and foreshadowings for acts 3-4. 
  
This quest will also tie in some vanilla quests around Falkreath for a more integrated experience (namely, Hircine's and Clavicus Vile's Daedric quests, along with exploration of Sunderstone Gorge and optionally Vaermina's and Peryite's quests).
  
**Default requirements**: witness at least 1 space-time fracture
  
**Delayed requirements**: default + finish Dac0da (because it's nice to have continuity and you do get some minor flavour dialogue with Rolls and Augur if they're already familiar with you)
  
  
**Ghost in the Mirror**
  
This is a short dream quest in which you will meet a certain character from ESO who will direct you to Falkreath to meet your "guide" and begin Glenmoril's main questline, while also giving you a few hints towards the underlying story of Vicn's entire modded series.
  
Additionally, your dream visitor will also want you to go deal with Mora's "First Servant" on Solstheim if you haven't already (you'll get alternative dialogue if you already finished Dragonborn DLC).
  
**Default requirements**: be level 50+ OR witness at least 3 space-time fractures OR have begun act 4 at least once already AND go to sleep
  
**Delayed requirements**: deafult (level req lowered to 25) + see option 5 (Hermaeus Mora and Vaermina are both relevant to the quest, and it's nice to have continuity from Dac0da and Vigilant)
  
**WARNING**: This quest is delayed via edited Glenmoril script. If you're changing to another delayed option, you MUST delete the Scripts folder OR completely replace the installation of delayed patch ("Replace" option in MO2, NOT "Merge").
  
  
  
**ADJUSTING LEVEL REQUIREMENTS**
  
If you are not happy with any of the offered starting level options, you can easily adjust that part of the patch to your own taste. To do so, do the following:
  
Spoiler
  

  
* open Glenmoril - Delayed Start.esp in xEdit and expand it
expand Global section
  
* click on entry zzzGlenmorilMinLevel
change entry Value to whatever level you want the mod to be available to start at (e.g. 10, if you're very brave)
  
* see this image if you need help:
