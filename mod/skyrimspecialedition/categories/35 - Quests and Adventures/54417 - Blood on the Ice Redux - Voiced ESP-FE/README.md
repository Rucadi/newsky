What is this mod?
  
  
Thanks to Lazy Voice Finder, it's relatively simple to splice voice lines with the sample size Skyrim has for its generic voice sets. BOTI Redux is an excellent quest mod, but adds three (four with the extra plugin) unvoiced conversations. I have replaced these silent lines with lines I personally spliced from vanilla dialogue. It's much better than silent, and I'm fairly happy with it (aside from one glaring line that really is impossible to make better).
  
  
I built this off a personally esl-ified version of BOTI - Redux and BOTI - Redux Extra. As such, it will only work with my esl-ified plugins: hence why that is included. I recommend you install this on a new game, and 100% do not replace an existing BOTI Redux install on an existing save. 
  
  
This mod also alters some player dialogue in addition to the NPCs, to better fit the contexts of the spliced lines.
  
  
How do I install?
  
  

  
1. Download and install [BOTI Redux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6126)﻿ and Optionally, BOTI Redux XTRA (optional file on the same page). Xtra is just for purchasing Calixto's house after BOTI. You will need the scripts from these as I have not included them in my file.
Download my BOTI Redux primary file and BOTI Redux XTRA optional file if you use that.
  
2. Install my mod(s) overtop your existing BOTI Redux install - my plugins should overwrite the original plugins.
Optional: I highly recommend you install [Nostalgic - Chef's](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/87340)﻿ voice lines on top of mine. The AI generated lines generally sound better than the spliced.
  

  
That's it. I personally use and recommend [Finding Susanna Alive](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32512)﻿ by SomethingObscure. It's compatible without any changes, just make sure you install the BOTI Redux version. 
  
  
Permissions & Credits
  
  
Voice lines are free for anyone to do with as they see fit. If any splicers make a better alternative to my one horrible Viola line (when she names names), please send it my way so I can replace the existing line. I'm done attempting to splice a line that includes the relevant information for that though (how does a woman obsessed with the murders never name the previous victims).
  
  
Thanks to [ZZhukov](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/9254441) for the original BOTI Redux, as well as for leaving the permissions open enough to permit this. Also thank you so much for writing scripts that don't reference FormIDs so I could esl-ify this.
  
  
Thanks to [Nostalgic - Chef](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/87340) for fixing the lines. They are not available in my file, but you can download them from the [respective page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/87340).
