Requires [There Is No Umbra](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89089)﻿﻿ as well as the Umbra Creation!
  
  
  
There Is No Umbra is an incredible mod, and I think many would agree with me - even being the ardent supporter of the Creation Club that I am - that the content included in There Is No Umbra is superior to that of the Umbra Creation's. The Creation is fantastic, too - I thought it had a good dungeon and a very enjoyable boss fight. However, if I had to pick a "true" Umbra in Skyrim story? I think I would have to go with There Is No Umbra every time.
  
  
[FableForge](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/707737)﻿ (author of There Is No Umbra) was asked about addressing the issue of "two Umbras" once a while back - here was their response:
  
  
*"I thought about it, but then I asked myself how would I feel if the other author did that same patch against me? I think he is the creator of Interesting NPCs, too. So yeah, no. I don't want to mess with how other authors tell their version of the Umbra story -let each player resolve it in head-canon, or let someone else make a patch, I just don't want to be disrespectful :)"*So I've decided to be that someone else.
  
  
And I cannot stress this enough: this mod means no disrespect to either the authors of either There Is No Umbra or the Creation itself - when I set out to make this, I wanted to make it in such a way that it would preserve as much from the Creation as possible. I completely understand where FableForge is coming from and I do agree, a player's headcanon is good enough - and that's basically exactly what this patch is, a headcanon given form.
  
  
I made this because having two Umbras bothered me. A few months ago, I had actually decided to leave There Is No Umbra out of my modlist because of it. Silly, to be sure, but that's just how I am - I typically follow a "hierarchy of canon". Vanilla Game -> Creation Club -> Mods. But a mod as good as There Is No Umbra gives me pause. I made this for myself in order to give both the Creation and the mod a place within "my" Skyrim.
  
  
So what *exactly* does this patch do?

**Changes to Creation Club's Umbra**
  
  
The Creation Club Umbra has been renamed to Penumbra. All references to it in the Creation itself have been renamed accordingly. Certain aspects such as the quest log outright calling it a Daedric Artifact have been changed as well - this new blade is an unknown altogether and is referred to as such. With the Creation providing few opportunities to explore for answers as to Penumbra's origin and nature, it will remain just that for now - a mystery.
  
  
Stats and abilities are unchanged. I feel that any changes or weakening of it is unnecessary.
  
  
**Changes to There Is No Umbra**
  
  
None! Unless you use the version detailed below.
  
  
  
**Changes in the "Model Swap" Version**
  
With this version, Daumbra (in all her forms) will use the Creation's sword model. Penumbra (from the Creation) will use the sword model from There Is No Umbra - whichever one you may have chosen in that mod's installer! All screenshots are taken using the default model from There Is No Umbra, but if you chose a different model, Penumbra will reflect that choice. This version was made for myself, but I had seen a request like this pop up before, so I figured it would be worth releasing.

Flagged as ESL. Will work regardless of game version, so long as you own the Umbra creation.
  
  
Necessary fixes from the [Unofficial Skyrim Creation Club Content Patches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18975) have been properly carried over.﻿
  
  
Enjoy, and let me know if there's any issues.
