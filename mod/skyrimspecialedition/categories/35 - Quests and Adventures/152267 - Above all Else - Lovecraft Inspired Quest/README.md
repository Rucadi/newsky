Introduction:**[/u][/size][/b]

  
* Above all Else revolves around a vampiric Khajiit named Dar'balag. As you encounter this mysterious figure, you'll begin to learn more about his quest of "becoming above all else" and his purpoted gift of being able to see the ancient dead. Delving into some very niche and interesting lore topics, in his own convulted way Dar'balag will share more about his goals, origins and intentions to achieve his lofty ambitions. The quest sticks entirely to lore established within Skyrim while giving my own twist on the underutilised aspects of certain parts.

* **Unique questline.** While many of my other quests follow this encounter-based style, Dar'balag is completely unique with his accompanying story, abilities and lore he can share with the player. As you travel with him, you'll learn fragments of these factors and despite the cat's enigmatic nature, with some deciphering I believe the story and lore I have referenced and built upon should offer an incredibly unique look at the established material within Skyrim and ESO.

  
* **Interesting NPC.** Due to the Khajiit's ambitions and vampiric nature, this NPC should be entirely unique and vastly different from not only other mods, but my own content. With a much more ruthless and uncaring attitude, I believe that his character will create a great sense of conflict for many characters, forcing a choice between good and evil.

  
* [size=2]**New location.** While not a huge new dungeon or location, I took great care in designing a single interior that would add to Dar'balag's story and expand upon the mystery established with his dialogue.[/size]

  
* [size=2]**Fully voiced.** This quest has been voiced by a newcomer to my mods, [Marchand Steenkamp](https://youtube.com/@alteredstateadventures?si=jMvvBhgoJhQ6eEbQ)﻿. While not seen before in my other projects, he did such an incredible job with Dar'balag and you'll be seeing him a lot more in future :))[/size]

**FAQ:**[/u][/size][/b]Can the mod be downloaded mid-game?

How do I start the quest?

Why can Dar'balag be encountered during the day?
