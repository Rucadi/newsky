This mod prevents the "In the Shadows" quest dialogue option from appearing until the player becomes Thane of Whiterun. It doesn’t alter any other quest mechanics—simply delays the dialogue to ensure a smoother experience. Created after discussions with fellow players on Discord, who thought the quest was bugged when the assassin failed to appear before the player became Thane. This mod addresses that confusion by syncing the quest's start with your progress in Whiterun.
  
  
**Compatibility:**Any mods that alter Proventus Avenicci’s dialogue options related to the *Bow of Shadows* Creation Club content will not be compatible with this mod.
