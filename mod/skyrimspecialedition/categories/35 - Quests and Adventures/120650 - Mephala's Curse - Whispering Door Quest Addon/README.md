# Mephala's Curse - Whispering Door Quest Addon
- Author: MadAborModding

**Mod Overview**
  
[The Whispering Door - Quest Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76606) by Jayserpa adds new ways non-evil characters can go about obtaining the Ebony Blade and AndrealphusVIII's [Aetherium Forge Destroys Items](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/114021) adds an awesome method to destroy it Lord of the Rings style.
  
  
What "Mephala's Curse" seeks to do is branch these two mods together by expanding the consequences involved with taking the Ebony Blade. Additionally, in-lore the Blade is supposed to drive its wielder mad. In-game, of course, this is not the case. Until now that is!
  
  
This mod adds a functioning curse to the Ebony Blade in addition to new world encounters. Now the player must find a way to destroy the Blade or succumbing to Mephala's evil is inevitable.
  
  
**New Gameplay Features**
  
Mephala's Minions Ambush Player
  

  
* If the player has the Ebony Blade in their inventory and has not used it to kill a friend, Mephala will become unpleased.
Until Mephala is appeased or the blade is destroyed, Spider Daedra (a newly added creature) and Morag Tong Assassins/Cultists will periodically ambush the player.
  
* The assailants carry notes explaining their purpose.
The encounters occur in the wilderness of Skyrim randomly about once every 1-2 weeks. (**ADJUSTABLE IN FOMOD**).
  
* If a break is needed, storing the Blade in a chest stops the attacks temporarily until it is picked up again (A "Hardcore" mode is available too where the player cannot drop the Blade unless they are at the Aetherium Forge).

  
The Curse of the Ebony Blade - Madness
  
Utilizes [Stress and Fear - A Dynamic Sanity System](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/116522).
  

  
* Every 24 hours, having the Blade in your inventory will cause the player's stress to rise﻿.
The more friends killed the less stress added, until no stress is added at all when the Blade is at full power.
  
* Killing a friend removes all player stress. (Only works in-game. Do not attempt irl.)

  
New Creature: Spider Daedra

* Spider Daedra will Ambush the player as described above if Mephala is unhappy.
Additionally, a spell book to summon them can be found in the same room the Ebony Blade is located in.
  
* Optionally, a [SkyPatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106659)﻿ INI is offered in the FOMOD installer to add them as companions to enemy Hagravens and Vampires at appropriate levels as well.

  
In lore, Mephala is known as the the "Webspinner" and Spider Daedra serve her in ESO. So as soon as I came across the Spider Daedra's asset, adding in the creature to Mephala's quest in Skyrim was something I wanted to do. The Spider Daedra asset is from [JG Monsters 3.0.5](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=222035755)﻿by jackGa which has open usage permissions.
  
  
Aethrium Forge Destroys Items - Letter Addon
  
Requires [Aetherium Forge Destroys Items](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/114021). Main file of "Mephala's Curse" technically not required.
  

  
* Adds a letter urging the player to seek out the Aetherium Forge to destroy Daedric artifacts.
It will be sent to the player a single time a few days after either they acquire any artifact or, if installed mid-game, when one is detected in their inventory.
  

Contents of the Letter are below (WARNING SPOILERS):
  
Spoiler
  
(PLAYER NAME HERE),
  
  
You do not know me, and my name is unimportant. I have been impressed by your many accomplishments, yet I am compelled to reach out due to troubling rumors.
  
  
I have heard that you may be in possession of a Daedric artifact. For your own sanity, you must find a way to destroy it.
  
  
As a former Vigilant of Stendarr, I have seen far too many good and honorable individuals fall victim to the temptation of the Daedra. 
  
If this letter can spare you that fate, it would alleviate some of my deepest regrets.
  
  
Enclosed with this letter is a book about the Aetherium Forge, a remarkable Dwemer creation said to have been used to craft items as powerful as the most vile of Daedric artifacts. 
  
If the Forge truly exits, I am certain it can unmake anything cast into its fires.
  
  
Daedric artifacts bind themselves to their bearers, corrupting their very souls. Merely passing it on will not free you from its grasp. It must be destroyed.
  
I urge you to seek the Aetherium Forge and use its power. I fear for what might become of you otherwise.
  
  
If I were still capable of wielding my hammer, I would gladly join you on this quest. However, I fear my time on Nirn is nearing its end.
  
Nevertheless, given your proven accomplishments, I am confident you will succeed.
  
  
With hope,
  
An Old Man
  
  
  
**Requirements and Installation**
  
[The Whispering Door - Quest Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76606)﻿ - Optional, **BUT YOU SHOULD INSTALL THIS MOD**. Expands the questline and adds a way for good characters to acquire the blade.
  
[Aetherium Forge Destroys Items](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/114021)﻿ - V1.5+ Optional, **BUT YOU SHOULD INSTALL THIS MOD**. This mod adds the way I intend to have the player destroy the blade which is implied in the added quest log and everything. My mod has no built-in way to the destroy the Ebony Blade. The quest simply ends when you get to the Aetherium Forge.
  
[Stress and Fear - A Dynamic Sanity System](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/116522) - Optional. The curse addon of the mod requires this. If you aren't interested in the stress curse, you do not need the mod.
  
  
The quests and features in "Mephala's Curse" become enabled when you hold the Ebony Blade for the first time, when Mephala describes how to power up the blade. Be prepared for what comes after.
  
  
(If installed mid-game in a save where the Whispering Door questline has already been completed, the mod will start up automatically if the Blade has not yet been restored to full power.) 
  
  
**Compatibility**A patch is offered in the FOMOD installer to alter the Vigilant ending in [The Whispering Door - Quest Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76606)﻿.
  
With the patch, Mephala disapproves of the player giving the blade to the Vigilant, intervening directly and retaliating. This makes the ending fit closer thematically with what my mod is trying to do, not giving the player an easy-out. See video below:
  
  
A patch for [Requiem](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60888) is also in the FOMOD which balances the new daedra and spells.
