Do you know Grosta? The owner of the Heartwood Mill in the Rift has a small quest but it's broken and too short, so I fixed and added some part for the quest with spliced voice lines. The esp file is ESL flagged.
  
  
  
**[left]Problems -----------[/left]**
  
A. If you speak with Grosta first, the quest works well, but if you find out what happened to her husband first, the quest doesn't go well.
  
B. Grosta's son is just standing all daytime in front of the house.
  
C. There are no way to help Grosta afterwards.
  
  
You may say Unofficail Skyrim Special Edition Patch fix the quest, but I have a different view.
  
Yes, USSEP fixes the broken start of the quest, but the husband's name is displayed without any context. [spoiler alert] [UESP says it's a bug](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Flight_or_Fight)﻿, but it's not IMHO. And also, it doesn't fix the broken AI Package for Gralnach, the son of Grosta.
  
  
  
  
**[left]Solution -----------[/left]**
  
A. Added a clue to get what happened, and fixed the quest flow.
  
B. Added new AI packages.
  
C. Added another misc quest to help Grosta.
  
  
After the vanilla quest, you can help Grosta in several ways.
  
i. Getting lumber deals from somewhere in Skyrim, and those have **no quest markers.**
  
ii. Buy Sawn Logs from Grosta
  
iii. Directly invest some amount of gold.
  
  
And after you successfully help her, she will give you a key of the house and you can use bedroll in there.
  
Also, she will keep paying back small amount of gold later on.
  
  
**Bonus**- Fixed the door of the Grosta's house, not working with [Simply Knock](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14098) and sometimes NPC were stuck in the house.
  
- I added a patch for [NPCs Names Distributor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73081), to avoid really random name displayed for the husband. 
  
  
**Installation ----------**
  
  
Load Order
  
1. USSEP (if you use it)
  
2. This mod
  
3. Any mods touches interior of the house (if you use it.)
  
    It can be lighting/embers mods.
  
4. Interior Patch (if you need)
  
  
**Mid Game Install
  
Of course I recommend to install for a new game, but...**
  
It's okay to install this mod if you haven't spoken to Grosta AND haven't get into the Broken Helm Hollow.
  
  
If you already done the quest, you will need to use console command below.
  

```
setstage MAA_Grosta 0
  
setstage FreeFormHeartwoodMill 200
```

  
It should work but Quest Objectives can be messed.
  
  
**Compatibility -------**
  
  
Some mods edits the interior of the house may have conflict.
  
The optional file "Grosta's House Interior Patch" is tested to work with below, and should work with almost all of the mods.
  
- [Skyrim Landscape and Water Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26138)
  
- [Fires and Embers Clipping Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/75146) & its SLaWF Patch
  
- [Snazzy Furniture and Clutter Overhaul (SFCO3) - Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/113045)
  
  
What it does in behind the scene.
  
SpoilerThis patch moves all the interior objects to different position. So newly added objects by other mod won't show up inside of the house. So the changes of your fancy interior mod won't show up with this patch, except those are using Base Object Swapper and similar replacement mods.
  
  
Texture mods should work without problem.
  
  
Please [report any compatibility issue](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/10521) you encounter with conflicting mods info.
  
I will try to make a patch.
