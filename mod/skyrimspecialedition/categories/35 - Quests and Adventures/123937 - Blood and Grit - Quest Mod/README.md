**Blood and Grit

  
[b][size=5][u]Introduction:**[/u][/b][/size][size=2]
  
[/size]Blood and Grit centres around one NPC, Rhico, a travelling hunter who has taken up the hobby of brawling. He'll challenge the player to various unarmed duels and as the player completes more of these tasks, they'll be able to learn more about his past and the reasons for him picking up this passtime. The mod goes over some fairly heavy topics, all of which are not covered in the base game, and likely other mods. It should offer a unique emotional experience for players who want a break from the much grander issues facing the Dragonborn in other quest mods.**[u][size=5][b]Features****:**

* **Unique questline.** Rhico's questline goes over many topics that are experienced by many in the real world, yet are never mentioned in Skyrim's base game, along with many mods. Covering these issues in this format should offer the player with not only an engaging quest, but may also leave a lasting impression on the player. Furthermore, Rhico will allow the player to have their own voice by asking various questions, which when answered will be called back to later, allowing for a sense of roleplay not found in many quests.
**Fully Voiced.** Rhico is voiced by the incredible [size=2][MeekVoice](https://www.castingcall.club/meekvoice), a VA with countless hours of experience and someone I've worked with in the past to create Mysteries of the Dwemer. He did an excellent job with this difficult and lengthy script and really makes Rhico feel alive.[/size]

The vanilla brawling system is deeply flawed, and so I had to create my own version. This mostly works but does have its limitations. The main one being that you CANNOT have a follower accompany you on Rhico's quest. It's incredibly annoying, I know, I tried everything to fix this but I couldn't find a way. If you bring a follower, they will join in with the brawl and beat Rhico to a pulp, so just dismiss them and make sure they're gone from the area before you fight Rhico.
