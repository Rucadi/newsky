Sirenroot: Deluge of Deceit is a dialogue-heavy dungeon dive into Ayleid ruins with puzzles, platforming, and a focus on water mechanics.
  
With influences from Tomb Raider and Dragon Age, you'll jump, climb, dive, solve puzzles and fight undead-
  
 as well as control other characters, persuade, look for clues, and determine the fate of others.

Light pours out from behind the roots, hinting at a flooded tunnel below.
  
You and a team of divers are hired by the Black-Briars to investigate the cave, and salvage the alchemical ingredient.
  
It appears a simple job at first, but as the cavern's structure falls apart around you, the team finds themselves buried in the ruins below.* [/font]

* A 2-5 hour long quest with multiple endings, and many options for the player's dialogue.
A large puzzle dungeon with a focus on **verticality**[color=#ffffff], **assisted platforming**, **diving sections**, **water control** and **[color=#9fc5e8]shortcuts**[/color][/color].
  
* **Cutscenes**[color=#ffffff], **climbing**, and **non-player character control**[/color] make the quest feel like no other.
**~1000 sentences** of voiced dialogue by a talented cast of voice actors.
  
* Unique NPCs: with defined personalities and pasts, they react to your choice of words. Character sections have **multiple completion routes.**
These **NPCs may live or die, according to the player's choices. Don't reload. The others will react.**
  
* Lead NPCs are also 'standalone' visually, with hand-sculpted faces, unique skin, hair and outfits. Even unique animations!
**Turn up the in-game music!** A newly produced joint [14 track OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBgfWpj12As)﻿ featuring [young scrolls](https://www.youtube.com/@youngscrolls/featured)﻿, for cutscenes, cells & secrets.
  
* Use of the new Ayleid tileset from the 1.6 update, alongside 100+ new mesh assets.

**Optional Requirement:** [The Cause](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Cause)
  

  
* Some Ayleid assets, like doors, use sounds from The Cause. These will default to another base Skyrim sound/silence if you do not have it.

No level or quest requirements.\*
  
Enemies scale with your level. The narrative is best suited to early (~level 3-15) adventurers.
  
Speak to Frissa Black-Briar at Elgrim's Elixirs in Riften.
  
  
For detailed quest information, here is [the full walkthrough article.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/5264)
  
*\*There are a fair amount of long underwater sections.
  
Being prepared with waterbreathing can help, but is not necessary unless you have mods that slow down swimming.*

Click the spoiler below for details like **troubleshooting, compatibility,** and more about the mod.

**TROUBLESHOOTING / INSTALLATION**
  
[spoiler]
  
  
**Q: Can I install this on an existing save?** 
  
Sure. Don't uninstall it after you've saved though.
  
  
  
**Q: I'm crashing when I open the game!**
  
You probably don't have the latest version of Update.esm. Delete it and re-verify. (You're probably missing the new assets too. See you in the next two troubleshooting questions!)
  
 
  
  
**Q: Assets are missing after the collapse! Purple stuff, missing dungeon areas!**
  
One of two things are possible:
  
1. Whatever platform you're running on (steam, etc.) didn't update your assets correctly from an older version.
  
2. Your game version is prior to the 1.6+ update, and thus does does not have access to the Ayleid tileset.
  
  
If your game is downgraded, backup these files to paste back in later:
  
SkyrimSE.exe
  
bink2w64.dll / binkw64.dll
  
  
Delete these from your data folder, (backup if you want,) and re-verify files through Steam, etc.
  
Update.esm
  
Skyrim - Meshes0.bsa
  
Skyrim - Textures3.bsa
  
Skyrim - Patch.bsa (you may not have this, that's fine.)
  
Skyrim - Misc.bsa
  
  
Add your backup files.
  
  
**Q: I can't open chests!**
  
Try [this file.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58373?tab=description) (Don't delete stuff as they said, actually download their main file.)
  
  
  
**Q: Buttons aren't working at all!**
  
Whatever platform you're running on (steam, etc.) didn't update your scripts correctly.
  
Look at the above steps for 'missing assets.'
  
  
  
**Q: I do not want to 'update' my game in anyway that's out of my control!
  
Q: or I'm on VR!
  
How can I still play your mod?**
  
Note, I do not recommend this. I cannot confirm if this would 100% work. And it's annoying to do.
  
You'll need access (somehow, maybe another installation) to an AE game.
  
You'll need these updated files specifically:
  
Update.esm
  
Skyrim - Meshes0.bsa
  
Skyrim - Textures3.bsa
  
Skyrim - Patch.bsa (maybe not?)
  
Skyrim - Misc.bsa
  
  
Use the new Update.esm.
  
Extract these folders from the .bsas. You can use [this to do so.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/974)
  
meshes\creationclub\\_shared\dungeons\ayleidruins
  
textures\creationclub\\_shared\dungeons\ayleidruins
  
Scripts\(all "ccbgs.." related scripts.)
  
  
You can package this into a mod for your mod manager, or just dump it into your data folder.
  
  
  
  
**Gameplay**
  
Spoiler
  
  

  
* There is no level requirement, combat encounters range from level 1 and up. Pulls from existing leveled lists in your game.
Follower support is bare bones. You can *try* to have them tag along- but it's not designed for it. There will be a lot of teleporting. They might get lost.
  
* You do not need to be an Argonian/have water breathing skills. I recommend an [Oxygen meter](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64532)﻿﻿ mod.
This mod does not account for sprint jumping or double jumping. All 'difficult' platforming sections are possible in vanilla with the smallest races.
  
* Ambient lighting is *dramatically* low, nearly pitch-black.
    
  [list]
I have spent a large amount of time testing lighting not only for visuals, but for gameplay reasons- not only for leading to progression, but also to push to the engine light limit (4 shadow casting lights in field of vision, 7 lights maximum 'touching' a single mesh) while accommodating for a single extra light. (like a torch/spell.) Feel free to use one should you feel it is necessary, though you might find having a torch out means you may not be see how the lights guide your way.
  

[/list]
  
  
  
**VISUALS & PERFORMANCE**
  
Spoiler
  
  
Visual Recommendations
  

  
* I recommend [Ayleid-related ENB Lights](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62415?tab=description)﻿﻿, [Ayleid retextures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58792?tab=description), and [upscaled architecture textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58801?tab=description)﻿﻿. (See the file at the bottom.)
I also recommend [fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32117)﻿ for certain [mesh](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63862) ﻿types, as many designs are heavy with meshes that are (for some reason) broken in vanilla.
  
* I have designed underwater sections with vanilla 'vision' in mind, but I do think clearer water makes it look nicer.
Some lighting mods heavily affect the look of dust & light beam effects. Personally, I threw [this](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2407?)﻿ on top of Lux to retain the vanilla beam look.
  
* This mod has large caves. With lots of rocks & shaping, some cave retextures look.. unsightly. I recommend [Skyland](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34179) ﻿﻿or [Underground](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14365)﻿.

  
Technical Performance
  

  
* Any new textures are 'middle of line' in comparison with standard retextures, ex: 2K faces & clothes + 1K normals, 2K architecture..
An HD pack is available in the optional files. I recommend this if your card has above 4GB VRAM.
  
* Occlusion planes and room bounds are set up. There isn't any more clutter than you'd expect in other dungeon mods. Cells are fairly small.
No intense scripting, everything is single fire.
  

  
  
  
**COMPATIBILITY**
  
Spoiler
  
  
**Improved Camera SE:**
  
Default .ini settings conflict with camera scripting in Sirenroot. To fix this, change..
  
  
SKSE\Plugins\ImprovedCameraSE\Profiles\Default.ini
  

```
[EVENTS]
  
bScripted=1
  
bThirdPerson=1
```

  
**Followers:** I'd only bring ones that you can recall with spells, etc. They'll probably get lost in the dungeon.
  
 
  
**Dialogue:** The quest mod is fairly isolated. There are no edits to existing dialogue systems with vanilla NPCs, only added on top through the plugin's quests.
  
  
**Cell Edits:** There may be possible conflicts with anything that touches the connected water-to-land area with Riften's lake, right by Merryfair Farm. It's quite far away from the city. Please let me know. Frissa Black-Briar was also placed inside Elgrim's Elixirs.
  
(Make sure your water mods and LOD stuff loads after this mod.)
  
  
The Sirenroot quest objects are only enabled in the area once the quest has started.
  
Riften dock overhauls should be fine.
  
  
**Lighting:** (Mods like Lux, ELFX, RLO, etc..)
  
Likely not necessary to make patches. Lighting is hand placed for level design reasons, and cells use custom lighting templates.
  
(a patch might be useful if it looks really off with your ENB, but otherwise would change the intended look.)
  
  
**Mobility:** The mod was not designed with mods like Better Jumping (allows double jumping) or Skyrim's Paraglider in mind.
  
Increased mobility mods, and even Whirlwind Sprint should not break anything- I took extra care to make sure event/script triggers occur in the proper order should things be skipped, but overall, I would let those mods take a back seat here. Puzzles!
  
  
  
  
**FAQ & Author Notes**
  
Spoiler
  
  
**Q: Is this a horror mod? Should I play it with the lights off? Content warnings?**
  
Some moments can be tense danger-wise, but it's mostly atmospheric tension/panic caused by gameplay reasons. (Long time underwater, timers.) No jumpscares or [floating ghosts that chase you under a lake of ice](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4155). The mod isn't scary, but I did want to give an eerie/dread feeling overall. The most emotions characters can show are: being angry at the player, or pleading desperately for help. You won't find anything particularly more grim than base Skyrim.
  
  
**Q: How long is the mod? Is there a lot of dialogue?**
  
I'd say 4-6 hours max if you take time with puzzles, like to ask every question, and don't skip lines. You could speedrun it in 40 minutes.
  
A lot of the time spent in dialogue contributes to how long the mod can possibly be- It's quite dialogue heavy.
  
  
I made sure to gently pad in-between longer dialogue moments with exploration/a puzzle/combat. However, a lot of scenes are optional. You can get 35% through the quest, completely ignore each character's main section, which is 40% of the content, and happily blitz your way to the end. This, obviously, changes the outcome of the quest though.
  
  
**Q: How is the roleplaying? Can I play as a chaotic evil character who kills everyone?**
  
Uh. I had considered a 'immediately attack lead characters the first time you met them' dialogue thing, but ultimately it was too much work when it came to scripting and checking who and who isn't alive in specific cases.
  
  
The player ultimately has these choices: Help, or refuse to help/ignore the problem.
  
  
There is a fair chunk of flavour dialogue (and responses!) when it comes to how aggressively your character may feel about situations as they come, but 'decisions' tend to be more straightforward. I'd like to try more flexibility with player morality an a project that isn't my second time ever lol
  
  
**Q: How similar is this to base game quests/other mods?**
  
It's pretty different, intentionally so. I just wanted to make something new and cool. You could call it gimmicky. I like doing new things!
  
  
**Q: You mentioned Clockwork above. How similar is this to Clockwork/other mods?**
  
I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a touch inspired by Clockwork. There are definitely big similarities in both of our stories and themes.
  
The main focus of Sirenroot is the multiple choice outcomes and the theme of deceiving the player.
  
  
A friend of mine also told me that my mod is very similar in themes to Maelstrom. (available on Loverslab.) I haven't played it though!
  
  
**Q: Does this have any followers?**
  
Nope.
  
  
**Q: Can I romance any of the characters?**
  
Nope.
  
  
**Q: You know MxR & PotasticPanda. Why didn't you ask Jeannie to voice a character?**
  
im shy
  
  
**Q: How long did it take to make this?**
  
8 months, on & off. I started in July 2022. There were a couple times where I didn't touch it for a full 40 days. So.. 4 months of daily work?
  
  
**Q: The Ayleidoon dialogue isn't accurate to the established grammatical structure in the lore.**
  
what would you do if ok so he said yes would go?
  
  
**Q: Is there anything you would change about the mod now that it's been released? Future content?**
  
(Minor spoilers.) Puzzle pacing is a bit odd. There was one rule self-imposed that I had broken: Introduce an element in a basic way to let the player understand it, then use the elements in a more complex way later. There needed to be a prep puzzle prior to Tilael's puzzle. I'd swap the timed swimming puzzle in the Morbalseli cell with the block climbing + timed lever puzzle in the cell right after the daydream, as I think that one is more difficult. I'd also add more padding in between the conversations. I think Cayrice could have used another minor section. A bit more reactivity near the end from the lead NPCs.
  
  
On the technical side, my papyrus & CK work has improved quite a bit. I did some bad practice stuff when it came to persistence. (It's fine though, 'tis just a mod.) There were some weird workarounds in scripts that weren't necessary because I wasn't aware of ways to do certain functions, but every script in Sirenroot is single-fire, so it's not an issue.
  
  
...
  
  
Story-wise, if I had the finances and time, I'd love to do a "director's cut."
  
I had much more stuck in my brain to flesh out the story of the ruins & the antagonist, but I wanted to release the project.
  
  
**Some things I had planned, but cut, major spoilers:**
  

  
* Ghosts of the previous dead adventurers
More violent/deceitful interactions with Larelleis
  
* Finding a vampire from the old adventuring team, and rescuing them

  
When it comes to the lead characters,

  
* Having lapses of judgement while affected by Larelleis and unknowingly sabotaging you
More elaborate 'careful' attitude/route with Tilael in her mirror puzzle rather than flavour + a consequence
  
* Literally travelling alongside Peletius & helping him loot his location if you rush to him immediately
Failing Cayrice's route would still cause her to come to the main hall and betray you later, ala. Yineel
  
* Two possible 'pre-boss fight' situations:
A risky puzzle door situation right after the portal, where you must choose team members to assist (eg. there are two switches deep underwater in separate locations. Do you choose Peletius & Yineel to activate them, knowing the former lacks his amulet and the latter still has an assassin on his tail? etc.)
  
* You enter the dreamy trance realm once again, and encounter each team member's vulnerable memories in a Fallout 4 Kellogg sequence
Tilael sees her Altmer & Dunmer adoptive parents argue over continuing to raise her. She feels a mix of missing them while also feeling vindicated
  
* Peletius sees his demanding father before he passes, and comments on how far he's come since then
Cayrice sees herself being congratulated by Synod scholars and her children. (Fine Cayrice) regrets bringing you here, (Possessed Cayrice) turns on you
  
* Yineel sees himself sparing a witness after a headhunting contract. (Safe) shows his regret, (No assassin) says this is private, (Possessed) turns on you

  
Outside of Lake Honrich,
  

  
* Depending on if you had soul-trapped Larelleis, a dream the next time you sleep where she possesses a team member
A quest per surviving lead character. (Admittedly, it would be bad to just not have content if they die. Good thing I haven't done it!)
  
* Tilael recovers a Maormer artifact, and you join her in a Elder-Scrolls-esque flashback to the first Era
Peletius brings you along an expedition to an island near Stros M'kai
  
* Cayrice invites you to Cyrodiil to have dinner with her family, but Dominion politics intervene
Yineel asks you to accompany him to confront the people holding a grudge against him
  

  
  
**Q: What did you learn from making this project?**
  
For future work, I'd make sure to plan out cells, puzzles and story further in advance. I struggled a bit with artist's block when it came time to make rooms and puzzles, which heavily slowed me down. As I mentioned 'prep' puzzles in the question above: I had reworked a few puzzles several times, and planning would have let me avoid that. This applies to pacing as well- place down the rooms first, decorate after. Creating 'vertical slices' makes reordering incredibly difficult.
  
  
A stronger focus in direction and intention for the mod was needed. I wanted a water dungeon at first, but then I introduced characters, which made me think about adding consequential dialogue, and then the project expanded in far too many directions as I kept going. I'm satisfied with the final product, but the lack of planning and intention made development tough.
