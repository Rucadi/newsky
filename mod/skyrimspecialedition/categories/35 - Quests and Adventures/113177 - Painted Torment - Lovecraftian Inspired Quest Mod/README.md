**Painted Torment﻿****Introduction:**
  
Painted Torment is a quest mod based around one NPC, Vane, and his pursuit of perfection when creating his magnum opus. The player will be tasked by Vane to gather various ingredients from all over Skyrim for Vane to crush into specific pigments. While a simple premise, the quest features a much deeper story for both Vane and the painting he is creating. The mod itself is inspired by various stories of H.P Lovecraft, and should offer an engaging horror experience not found in many other mods.
  

  

  
**Features****:**
  
  

  
* **Unique questline.** Inspired by quests like A Brush with Death from Oblivion and the work of H.P Lovecraft, the mod features a rich and unique story barely touched upon within the base game. It should provide players with an interesting experience not found in many similar mods.
**Custom Location.** I haven't shown the new location to avoid spoilers, but within the questline a new location can be explored. It is custom made for this quest by the incredible [size=2][size=2][JenzAmaka](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/185677)[/size] and should offer an *interesting* experience ;))[/size]
  
* **Fully voiced.**The mod features extremely high-quality voice acting done by a very talented individual, [talkingNsuch](https://www.castingcall.club/talkingnsuch)﻿. His voice work completely brings Vane to life and conveys a level of emotion not found in many other mods.

  
**Showcase:**
  
  
**FAQ:**Can the mod be downloaded mid-game?
  

  
* **Yes, it's completely fine to install mid-game.**

Is it ESLed?
  

  
* **It unfortunately can't be, as it exceeds the ESL limit. Sorry!**

Is the mod clean?
  

  
* **Yes, I have only edited the necessary cells, there should be no conflicts due to dirty edits.**

How do I start the quest?
  

  
* **You need to visit Vane's cabin and then speak to him. There are no quest markers, so don't worry when they don't appear.**

He's just sitting there after I said goodbye, is that normal?
  

  
* **Yep! Just wait a few days and the quest will progress.**

Can I make a patch for the mod?
  

  
* **I'd love if people made patches for any incompatibilities that arise, if** **you could send these to me I'll upload them onto the mod page**

Can it be ported to Xbox?
  

  
* **[size=2]The original porter who would do all of my mods can no longer do it. If you're up to it and agree to give credit along with including my showcases on the page, I have no problems with you porting it.**[/size]

  
**Bugs/Incompatibilities:**
