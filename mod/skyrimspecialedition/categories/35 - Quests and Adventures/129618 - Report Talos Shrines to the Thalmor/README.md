**"If You See Any Signs of Talos Worship..."**
  
  
Ever wondered why the Thalmor tolerate a Talos shrine in the middle of Markarth? Need an easy way to make some extra gold? Looking for more opportunities to roleplay as a narc and/or fascist bootlicker? This is the mod for you! 
  
  
**Report Talos Shrines to the Thalmor** does what it says on the tin--allows you to tattle on worshippers of all nine divines. Start the quest by reading the proclamation next to the Talos shrine in Markarth, or by speaking to Ondolemar directly. If you turn him down, nothing will change. If you agree to work with him, however, then whenever you encounter a shrine to Talos after that, you'll get a miscellaneous quest objective telling you to go report it. Once you do, Ondolemar will reward you with a leveled amount of gold.
  
  
This mod also makes changes to the world based on your reports--if you go back to the shrine later, you may find Thalmor soldiers attacking the worshippers, a proclamation decreeing the site illegal, or even rubble where the shrine used to be. This will vary depending on the shrine's location and any related plotlines--e.g. the Thalmor can't do much about the Temple of Talos in Windhelm, but they can and will destroy an unguarded statue in a remote wilderness.
  
  
100% voiced, with spliced vanilla dialogue. Cleaned with SSEdit. ESL-flagged.
  
  
  
**Vanilla Quest Interactions:**
  
  
**Diplomatic Immunity:** Reporting a shrine to Ondolemar will make him friendly to you, which you can then leverage to make him cause a scene at the embassy party.
  
  
**Elisef's Tribute:** In vanilla, Agent Lorcalin is supposed to appear and attack you as soon as you get close to the statue. I've adjusted Lorcalin's logic so that simply *approaching* won't cause him to appear, but activating the shrine or placing Torygg's horn will. I've also slightly rewritten the note he carries, to acknowledge the work of informants such as yourself.
  
  
**Ill Met By Moonlight:** The vanilla game deactivates the Talos shrine in Bloated Man's Grotto during Hircine's quest, and in some cases it Just Works (TM) and never reappears. If you want to both report this shrine *and* do Ill Met By Moonlight, then you should visit the grotto and get the objective "Report the shrine to Ondolemar" BEFORE you kill the Great Beast.
  
  
**Search and Seizure:** If you ever wished there were more quests like this one, this is the mod for you!
  
  
**The Civil War (Imperial Side)**: After the Empire wins, a proclamation is posted in Windhelm forbidding Talos worship.
  
  
**The Civil War (Stormcloak Side):** Obviously this quest is only possible as long as Ondolemar is alive and the Stormcloaks haven't won the civil war. They also can't have taken the city of Markarth yet--in the vanilla game, Ondolemar is executed as soon as the Stormcloaks arrive there.
  
  
**Other**: This only allows you to report shrines that already exist in the base game. **You cannot report any shrines that you yourself created or that are installed in a player home.** (And why would you want to, anyway?)
  
  
Aside from the quests noted above, this shouldn't cause any issues if you install it mid-playthrough.
  
  
  
**Compatibility With Other Mods:**
  
  

  
* [Environs - The Shrines of Talos](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85141?tab=description)﻿: Totally compatible, and also has the possibility to lead to some interesting interactions! (For example, you can meet worshippers at the Ilinalta shrine early on in the game, go report them, and come back later to find all of them dead.)
[Buying Proudspire Manor as a Thalmor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41227)﻿: Confirmed compatible. Agent Lorcalin will be hanging around the White River Gorge shrine whenever you find your way there.
  
* [Thalmorized Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29787)﻿: Confirmed compatible. Adds more possible Thalmor encounters to the world.
[Aldmeri Domain Strengthened](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/75271/)﻿: Not 100% compatible, but I did find a workaround. There's a strange bug where your initial conversation with Ondolemar may not trigger the next stage of the RTST quest if ADS is installed; I tried to make a patch but unfortunately fixing it was beyond my (admittedly limited) abilities. If you want to use my mod alongside ADS, then **as soon as you've agreed to help Ondolemar find Talos shrines, open the console and enter "setstage RTST01 20".** The objective should appear and you ought to be able to play normally from that point.
  
* [Second Great War](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17204)﻿: As of version 1.1, compatible without any patch necessary. However, RTST does still require Ondolemar to be alive, and that's only possible in Second Great War if the Imperials win the Civil War AND you side with the Thalmor at the start of the invasion. If you want any other lineup for your Great War, you'll have to complete RTST first.
[Search and Seizure﻿ - Quest Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67066)﻿: Confirmed compatible.
  
* If there's a mod that adds new Talos shrines to the world, you won't be able to report them without some kind of patch.
If there are any other mods that you're curious about compatibility for, feel free to test them out and let me know!
  

  
  
**Individual Shrine Details:**
  
I'm listing what changes (if any) occur at each shrine after you report them, just for convenience's sake. They're within spoiler tags, though, because I recommend getting in there, snitching on the believers, and finding out for yourself!
  
  
**Autumnwatch Tower (Froki's Peak):** SpoilerAfter this shrine is reported, you'll encounter a Justiciar in the process of slaughtering some worshippers. Intervene or not, as you see fit--but be careful not to worship there while the Justiciar is nearby. Activating the shrine may turn her hostile.
  
  
**Glaciers north of Alftand (Winterhold):** SpoilerSame as above; you'll find Thalmor murdering unarmed pilgrims. The soldiers will leave you alone, unless you prove to be a heretic too.
  
  
**Riften:** SpoilerAfter your report, a note is posted forbidding Talos worship. Somebody--or a few somebodies--graffitied it.
  
  
**Whiterun:** SpoilerA note is posted forbidding Talos worship. Nothing else changes. (Balgruuf will tolerate minor legalisms, but won't allow the Thalmor to enforce anything more rigorous. Heimskr will be left alone, assuming the player hasn't gotten annoyed enough to kill him yet.)
  
  
**Eastmarch Overlook (west of Windhelm):** SpoilerA note was posted. Somebody graffitied it and tore it down.
  
  
**Ilinalta Foothills (site of Agent Sanyon's massacre):** SpoilerNothing changes. You'll confirm Sanyon's information, but potential worshippers have already been scared away. As mentioned above, this location is also affected by Environs. 
  
  
**Cradlecrush Pond:** SpoilerA dead Thalmor wizard appears on the ground in front of the shrine. She tried to shut it down, but the worshippers fought back.
  
  
**Temple of Talos, Windhelm:** SpoilerOndolemar won't give you a reward for that--everyone *knows* that there's Talos worship in Windhelm! However, if the Imperials win the Civil War, a proclamation forbidding Talos worship will be posted.
  
  
(I didn't do anything more because I know there are multiple other mods out there that make changes to this temple in the event of an Imperial victory--sometimes pretty extensive ones. Those felt out of scope for this mod, but I wanted to maintain compatibility.)
  
  
**White River Gorge:** SpoilerNothing changes at the shrine as a result of your report. However, Agent Lorcalin may be lurking nearby, watching to make sure that you're a useful asset and not a filthy Talos worshipper. He'll only appear and attack if you activate the shrine or place Torygg's horn.
  
  
**Bloated Man's Grotto:** SpoilerA proclamation is posted as result of your report. I recommend reporting this shrine BEFORE doing Ill Met By Moonlight, as it may be permanently removed after the quest.
  
  
**Pilgrim's Trench (near the Sea of Ghosts):** SpoilerA dead justiciar appears next to the shrine. If the Stormclocks didn't get him, the cold probably did.
  
  
**Northwest of the College of Winterhold (Ilas-Tei's last stand)**: SpoilerThe shrine is destroyed thanks to your report. The vanilla skeever encounter and Ilas-tei's body remain untouched.
  
  
**Weynon Stones:** SpoilerAfter you make your report, the shrine and statue will be reduced to rubble, and a proclamation will be posted forbidding Talos worship. The vanilla ice wraith encounter remains untouched. 
  
  
  
**Update Log:**

  
* **Version 1.1**: Logic has been tweaked so that the quest can only proceed if the shrine is actually present. This should reduce conflicts with other mods. Also, the voice files for Ondolemar have been repackaged, so they should take up less space now.
**Version 1.2**: Removed an accidental wild edit that affected the masterambushscript. Also improved the logic that enables the proclamation in Windhelm, in order to increase compatibility with any Civil War mods you might be using.
