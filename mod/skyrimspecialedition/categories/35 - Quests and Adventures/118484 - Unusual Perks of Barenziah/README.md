Designed to reward the arduous task of collecting the Stones of Barenziah, this mod grants a perk point for each Stone you find scattered across Skyrim. Upon obtaining the illustrious Crown of Barenziah, receive an additional six perk points—one for the stone and five for the crown itself. For adventurers who already possess some or all of these precious stones or have even completed the quest, perk points will be granted retrospectively upon installation—up to all 30 if the quest is already complete. Whether you’re just starting or have already conquered this challenge, this mod adds an extra layer of reward to your journey through the land of Skyrim.
