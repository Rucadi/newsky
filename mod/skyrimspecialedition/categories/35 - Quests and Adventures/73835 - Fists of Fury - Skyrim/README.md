[![](https://i.imgur.com/nJG8wwG.png)](https://www.twitch.tv/missilemann)**

  
Inspired by the Witcher 3 quest of the same name, go and brawl some of Skyrim's toughest opponents in a brawling tournament being held. 
  
  
**Currently Features**

  
* 3 Brawling quests. One in Windhelm, Riften, and Morthal
A small arena down in the Ratway with spectators and fighters.
  
* A brawling camp that will have Windhelm's tournament once the quest starts.
Fight the three other contenders and defeat each hold's champion.
  
* Ability to spar with the other brawlers during certain times after the quest is completed.
Can spar with Gian between 5pm and 7pm
  
* Ratway Arena can be used as an inn
NPCs have post quest packages to make them feel alive post quest, including the fighters training and sparing with each other.
  
* Makes tweaks to the brawling package to make it slightly more bearable.

  
**How To Start**

In order to start the quest, you need to win a number vanilla brawls, after a day you will get sent a letter.
  
By default the number of wins require is three, but you can change this by typing in the console "set FOFBrawlWinsRequired to X"
  
X being any number above 1 (If you put a number below 1, it will just be treated as 1)

  
  
**Addons**

  
* [Hand to Hand](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59790)﻿: Adds some perks from Hand to Hand - An Adamant Addon to each fighter using a SPID file. Requires SPID obviously. This will make the fights A LOT tougher so make sure to prepare more.

* [Fearsome Fists](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Fearsome_Fists)﻿: Adds gauntlets from it to a small number of NPC's. Not everyone has one, only a few.
AE Integration: Includes everything from the Fearsome Fists patch plus includes some other armors from Creation Club content.
  

SpoilerDrackis - Given Brawler's Leather Gauntlets (In both versions) and Netch Leather Chestplate and Boots (Only in AE Patch)
  
Windhelm Fighter was given CC Iron Armor (AE Integration
  
Windhelm Champion was given Brawler's Steel Plate Gauntlets (Both Versions)
  
A Staff has been given the Silver Staff model from CC Staves (AE Integration)
  
  
Currently AE Patch requires Fearsome Fists, Netch Leather armor, Alternate Iron Armor, Alternate Daedric Plate Armor, and CC Staves.
  
More CC Stuff will be added as requirements as the mod updates.
  
  
Redguard Elite Armaments Tweak: All this does is make Azadi not spawn until after you've defeated a Champion. I only made this for my sanity.
  
  
**Future Plans**

  
* Other holds: I plan to do at least two or three other holds. I'm not sure if I will do all 9 holds. I have ideas for one or two holds currently. Nothing being worked on currently though.
The next major update will be a 2.0 update and will require a new save if updating. No ETA on when I will start working on this or when it will be released.
  

  

**﻿Compatibility**

  
* Only incompatibilities would be anything that changes the same area in the Ratway Vaults, the area east of Windhelm by the border, and anything that edits Maul's initial Riften Dialogue.
As for the Windhelm Camp, I made sure it works with Daedric Shrines AIO/Azura without a patch, and have provided a patches for Northern Roads and Teldryn Serious.
  

  

**F.A.Q.**

 ﻿Q: The brawls don't start/don't finish.
  
 ﻿A: I use the vanilla brawling system. I'm not sure why but for some reason it hangs up randomly. 
  
  
 ﻿Q: Where are the gloves of the pugilist?
  
 ﻿A: They are part of the Riften quest and you get it for completing that quest.

**﻿Recommendations**

[Modern Brawl Bug Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1473) or any mod that has it included like Simon's [Blade and Blunt](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34549).
  
If using Fearsome Fists, I recommend either [MichealDawn's](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62710) or [Jelidity's](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59460) Fearsome Fists mods to give them innate unarmed damage increase.
