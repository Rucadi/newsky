**Description**
  
  
**This mod has been merged in [Andrealphus Scene Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/115647/).**
  
  
During the Dark Brotherhood's introduction scene, where Babette tells the story of how she killed someone, the whole brotherhood bursts out laughing in this terribly forced, awkward and somewhat cringe-worthy way.
  
  
In a similar way, there's another laugh in the cut scene, near the Whiterun stables, where Uthgerd informs Skulvar Sable-Hilt about Cicero. The latter is cut content, however certain mods might restore it. (such as [Cutting Room Floor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/276), but there might be others.) This tweak does not directly require or depend on mods that restore that content, but it does need those mods to have the scene appear.
  
  
As it got old quite fast for me, I decided to just condition out the lines, so they will no longer be used.
  
  
Aftwards, some other people requested me to release it, so here it is.
  
  
**Details**
  
  
Dark Brotherhood introduction:
  
Spoiler
  

  
* ~~Arnbjorn: "Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!"~~
~~Veezara: "Ha ha ha ha! Again! Again! Do the part where he tries to buy you some candy."~~ 
  
* Babette: "Okay, okay. Wait. Here we go. "Ooh, you are such a pretty little girl. Would the sweetie like a sweetie? Oh yes, how about some chocolate?" Oh yes, please, kind sir. My mama and papa left me all alone, and I'm so very hungry. I know a shortcut to the candy shop. Through this alley. Oh ya, very good. Very good. My it is dark down here. Oh, but you are so beautiful. Such a lovely smile. Your teeth... your teeth! No! Aggghh!!"
Gabriella: "Oh Babette, but you are so wicked."
  
* Nazir: "What about you, Festus? How did that last contract turn out?"
Arnbjorn: "Oh, yes, please, old man. Regale us with your tales of wizardry..."
  
* Festus Krex: "Ah, the young and stupid. Always mocking the experienced and brilliant. My contract went very well, I'll have you know. Tried a new spell. Little something I've been working on in my spare time. Came "this" close to turning that priest inside out. Damned messy."
Gabriella: "And what of your latest, Arnbjorn. Something about a Khajiit? Merchant was it?"
  
* Babette: "Oh, a big doggy chasing a little kitty! How adorable!"
~~Nazir: "Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!"~~
  
* ~~Festus: "Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!"~~
 ~~Veezara: "Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!"~~
  
* Arnbjorn: "I am not adorable, it was not funny, and he wasn't a merchant. He was a Khajiit monk, a master of the Whispering Fang style. But now he's dead... and I have a new loincloth."

  
  
  
Uthgerd and Skulvar:
  
Spoiler
  

  
* Uthgerd: "By Ysmir, it's true. A jester - funny suit and all. Just north, by the Loreius Farm. Fool had a coffin in a cart, with a broken wheel. Like to see him laugh his way out that."
~~Skulvar: "Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!"~~
  
* ~~Uthgerd: "Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!"~~
Skulvar: "Well, sounds like you've had quite the journey, Uthgerd. But you were gone longer than usual. I got to thinking maybe you weren't coming back..."
  
* Uthgerd: "You sound like my ma. Figured I was lying dead in a field somewhere, is that it?".
Skulvar: "Thought did cross my mind, yeah. War brewing, talk of a riot in Helgen, and now jesters? Skyrim's gone mad, girl. You need to be careful out there."
  
* ~~Uthgerd: "Careful, huh? Thanks, Skulvar. I'll remember that. Ha ha ha ha ha ha!"~~

  
  
  
**FAQ**
  
  
Q: Why would you remove these lines? They are hilarious!
  
A: After hearing them for the millionth time, they got annoying for me. People requested me to release this. If you don't like it, that's fair enough. Just ignore this mod and move along.
  
  
Q: ESPFE?
  
A: Yes.
  
  
Q: Does installing/updating/uninstalling on an existing save work?
  
A: As far as I know, it should. However, it's good practice to keep a backup save prior to doing this, just in case.
  
  
Q: Is this compatible with <insert mod>?
  
A: I don't know by heart. You might need to check yourself.
  
  
Q: Will you make a patch for <insert mod>?
  
A: Only if it's a mod I use myself or plan on using, I have enough time and I actually like the idea. Otherwise, feel free to do it yourself. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: I have a suggestion to improve the mod. Can you do it?
  
A: Maybe, if I have time and I like the idea, I'll consider it.
  
  
Q: Will you port this to <insert platform>?
  
A: No, I myself only support the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If someone else wants to port it, feel free. (see permission) If you decide to port it, you yourself take full responsibility to offer support to said port. I will not provide no support for any ports by third parties.
  
  
Q: I use a ported version of this mod on <insert platform> and I have a problem. Can you help?
  
A: I don't provide any support for third party ports on other platforms than the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If you have issues, you should adress the person that ported it.
  
  
Q: Does this work on Skyrim 1.6+, aka "Anniversary Edition"?
  
A: Yes, it should.
  
  
Q: Why don't your mods use MCMs and instead use this janky console command system to set globals?
  
A: I am not a fan of MCMs. You can set the globals by making a patch in xEdit. I have no plans of changing this. If you want to add an MCM, feel free. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: Why don't you use FOMODs?
  
A: That would require reuploading the entire mod, in question, even if I only make a small change. My internet is limited and reuploading the files each time will take a huge chunk of my monthly volume.
