If you are trying to roleplay as an evil character, the first Dawnguard quest doesn't really make sense. Why would your evil character decide to pay a visit to Isran ?
  
  
**Features:**
  
  
This mod does a few things to improve the Dawnguard start. There is now 2 new ways to start the Dawnguard questline. After the Hall of the Vigilant is destroyed, you can either look for clues to find out the reasons for the vampire attack, or go directly to Dimhollow Crypt. The available dialogue options when talking to Serana will depend on whether or not you have already talked to Isran.
  
  
Unlike other mods that might add another way to start the DG questline, this mod will still allow the player to join the Dawnguard if they choose to do so, either directly after freeing Serana, or after refusing Harkon's gift.
  
  
Also made some tweaks to a few other things.
  

  
* 1 or 2 typo fixes in dialogues
The "Heard they're reforming the Dawnguard" rumor only happen in Riften.
  
* Prevents you from picking up items in Castle Volkihar during your first encounter with Harkon.
The armor set given by Gunmar to the player will now depend on your highest armor skill.
  

  
**Compatibility:**
  
  
Mods that alter some of the Dawnguard quests or their scripts are incompatible.
  
  

  
* Timing is Everything: Compatible

  
Load my mod after TiE
  
  

  
* Dawnguard as Vampire: Compatible

  
Load order between the 2 mods doesn't matter.
  
  

  
* The Choice is Yours: Patch available

  
.esl patch provided to fix 1 record changed by both mods. Just load it after both mods.
  
  

  
* Dawnguard - Tweaks and Enhancement: Incompatible

  
I might do a compatibility patch after taking a closer look to the source scripts in that mod.
  
  

  
* Path to Volkihar: Incompatible

  
Redundant. Both mods are trying to do the same thing.
  
  
  
**Known Issues:**
  
  

  
* If you visit Fort Dawnguard with Serana after freeing her, but have never talked to Isran before, Serana won't enter Dayspring Canyon and do her usual "I don't like the look of this place, I'll wait outside" dialogue. I'm not sure why this happens, but the impact is minimal since you can still tell Isran that Serana is waiting outside and he'll tell you to take her to her father.
