**A Dizzying Fall - Quest Mod**

**Introduction:**
  
A Dizzying Fall is an incredibly short mod that adds in a wounded Khajiit named Turo. Conversing with the NPC will have him sharing the lofty goal that caused him to become so injured. The mod is heavily inspired by the myth of Icarus but pictures his goal in a very different light. This short conversation also incorporates some Khajiit lore to make it feel more in place within Skyrim's world.
  
  
**Features:**

  
* **Unique idea.** The conversation is incredibly different from all quests in the vanilla game and ones featured in other mods, including my own. Turo is an ordinary character with extraordinary goals, which creates a very interesting dynamic for the player to learn and explore. While the encounter isn't very long, I believe the writing is some of my best and should offer a different experience than the ones felt in the aforementioned quests.

  
* **Fully voiced.** I specifically contacted [size=2][robbobert](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5284088) for this mod as I knew he was capable of delivering an incredible performance and that's exactly what he did! He did a great job with the delivery of his lines and really brings Turo and his dying words to life![/size]
