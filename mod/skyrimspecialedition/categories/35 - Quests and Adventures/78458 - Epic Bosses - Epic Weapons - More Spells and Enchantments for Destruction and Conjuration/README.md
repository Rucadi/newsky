This mod adds multiple spells, enchantments and boss fights to the game. Many bosses can be summoned and have the spell tomes in their inventory, along with the weapons, armour, and the spell tomes for most of the spells they use. Many of them are also loaded with valuable items, and some carry journals which tell their story and also level up a skill upon reading them. Many of the bosses use [unique weapons](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1743439487-948776484.png) and [armour](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1743435553-1140742078.png) with [unique models](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1743434698-1774087774.png) and [effects](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1743439632-967476335.png), and you can claim these items after beating the bosses. Epic bosses, with epic rewards.

**How to start:**
  
  
**When you load your save or start the game with this mod enabled, a book will suddenly appear in your inventory called "List of Threats**". Read it and it will tell a story about the bosses as well as their locations. After finally beating the deadliest boss of them all, the question of how and why the book appeared in your inventory will be answered. This book can also be crafted at both the tanning rack and the forge, in case you lose it. There is also an abridged version with notes that simply lists the boss and location, with some note about items or spells. Abridged version is also added to your inventory and is also craftable. 
  
  
**For convenience and/or in case you missed items:**

The items can all be found in a [chest found in the qasmoke cell](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1718168754-1462875119.png); simply open the console and type "coc qasmoke" without the quotations. This will take you to a room full of chests, including the one containing these items. After getting whatever you need from this room, type "coc riverwood" to get out. 
  
  
  
  
**[font=Tahoma]The Bosses:[/font]**
  
  
Spoiler 
  
  
**Cannibal Chef:** The Cannibal Chef is [located a little to the East of Folgunthur, in the swamps to the South of Solitude](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1692980226-760882053.png). He is equipped with uniquely enchanted weapons which can make fighting him difficult if you're careless, and is a decent boss for a medium strength player. The weapons can be disenchanted to make use of his enchantments. He is the weakest boss on the list. 
  
  
**Corrupted Executioner:** He is located in [a small open barrow, a short distance to the East of Fort Snowhawk](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1692980175-2069313924.png), in the swamps South of Solitude. He wields a two-handed axe with high damage output and dangerous enchantments, making him a significant threat at close range. His unique gear can be disenchanted or simply used and has some unique enchantments. He is more threatening than the Cannibal Chef, but he is still an early boss. 
  
  
**Ghostly Woman:** A [vicious ghost](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1698082991-1262680493.png) found in [the woods to the West of Half-Moon Mill, not far from the lakeside](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1698082542-1427146521.png). She wields a [custom axe](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1698082372-866554456.png) which is rather threatening and has a unique visual effect; it appears to be a wood cutting axe until it suddenly reveals itself as something much more. 
  
  
**Masked Slasher:** She is [located in the woods to the North of Falkreath, East of Falkreath Watchtower, right by the road](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1693396086-704579520.png). Primarily she is fast and has a dagger with an Absorb Health enchantment. She is inspired by slasher film villains of the more tricky and eccentric persuasion. She has multiple means of dodging attacks and generally being hard to pin down. She is very efficient at avoiding attacks, and meanwhile her dagger will drain your health. She is a threat indeed unless you can kill her quickly. 
  
  
**Huge Masked Man:** Inspired by slasher film villains of the more physically superhuman persuasion, this individual is [a huge man in a white mask](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1753884446-1320494770.png), who can be [found in the woods to the North of Falkreath](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1698082524-347432110.png). He is slow-moving, but he has an enormous amount of health, and can deal a lot of damage with his close-range weapon, and almost any NPC who tries to attack him will be sent running by a fear spell enchantment attached to his mask. Escaping him is easy but killing him is not. Note: his mask has clipping issues when worn by a beast race. 
  
  
**Invisible Assassin:** An almost invisible assassin found in [Brood Cavern, South-West of Morthal](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1718171028-376432433.png). She is fast, very difficult to see and wields a [unique dagger](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1743426961-196254830.png) that inflicts bleeding damage as well as poison damage, and also absorbs health.

**Electric Slaughterfish:** A very [strange slaughterfish](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1718169083-895140715.png), bright blue and emitting deadly electricity.

**Enormous Black Spider:** Another [spider](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1718168496-1720864917.png) found with the Freakish Spider, not as big, but more venomous.

It has a custom poison ability, moves very fast, and is generally as threatening as it looks. This is Blackreach's natural apex predator, and although its position on the top is challenged and even usurped by unnatural presences down there, it is still a highly threatening monster. 
  
  
**Wolf Spirit:** A large [ghostly wolf found leading a pack](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1698083262-1384457652.png) of regular wolves [in the woods North and West of Falkreath, not far from the Roadside Ruins](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1698083316-2005716905.png). In life, it was the apex predator of the Falkreath woods, until [something else](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1693389001-791909692.png) appeared and took its place at the top along with its life. Once a proud predator, now a vengeful spirit, and always a dangerous beast. 
  
  
**Monstrous Giant Bear:** A [bear the size of a mammoth](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1696264911-2080712114.png), capable of dishing out blows that shake the earth, and inflicting immense damage with attacks that also inflict wounds that continue to damage your health. Its natural food is mammoths and giants, but it's more than happy to eat men, mer and beastfolk for appetizers. Found in the woods North of Falkreath, West of Falkreath Watchtower. It is not only strong, but fast as well. This is the apex predator of the woods. 
  
  
**Strange Ghostly Troll:** A [large troll ghost](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1698083273-953687988.png) found in the Forgotten Vale, roaming on top of the frozen lake under the balcony of Auriel's temple. Is something of a throwback to ancient trolls, and has the power to show for it. Larger and stronger than a giant, and ready to destroy anything foolish enough to come near it. 
  
  
**Giant Slaughterfish:** A [slaughterfish which would be at home in a monster movie](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1693389412-2099146617.png), except that it would probably win and eat all the heroes. Similar to the Giant Slaughterfish in Oblivion, but far larger, and inflicts enormous damage, with attacks that also inflict wounds that continue to damage your health, a tactic used by sharks to great effect in real life. It is a terror to sailors and creatures alike, smashing ships and swallowing horkers whole. [Found in the Sea of Ghosts, North of Broken Oar Grotto](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1698083334-1331176290.png). 
  
  
**Massive Blue Crab:** A [huge blue crab large enough to pick up a horker](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1693388886-1596014610.png) in its pincer, not too dissimilar from the Emperor Crab, and wielding frost magic. Only responsible for a few sunken boats, unlike the Giant Slaughterfish. However, it becomes hostile very quickly if approached. Even being near this creature is dangerous, as it chills the air and water around it to deadly temperatures, and its attacks deliver an even deeper chill, accompanied by its already immense striking power. Found just North and West of Broken Oar Grotto, not far from the land. Prepare to face both magic and sheer power, because this monster possesses both. 
  
  
**Massive Black Crab:** A huge black crab very similar to its blue relative, except that it uses poison and fire instead of ice, and is [better suited to hiding due to its darker colour](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1700924949-560843379.png). It is [found slightly to the West of where the Massive Blue Crab is, slightly North and a short distance West of Broken Oar Grotto](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1700924956-1186787996.png). 
  
  
**Massive Red Crab:** A vampiric variant of the huge crabs. Technically a bit less powerful than its cousins, but makes up for it by having an [army of smaller vampiric mudcrabs](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1743426550-63657990.png). [Found West of Dawnstar](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1743426981-201361564.png).

The monster of the lake it lives in. Not only powerful, but [stealthy](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1723379120-556344838.png) as well. Found in Lake Illinalta.

He is a dangerous man who has travelled through multiple planes of Oblivion, and he has the abilities and equipment to show for it. 
  
  
**Fiery Horse:** A [large skeletal horse with red colouring and bright flames billowing from it](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1700925080-183095204.png). Has powerful and explosive attacks and is available as a summon and steed if you can beat it. It is found slightly to the [South of the Altar of Thrond, to the North of Highpoint Tower](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1700925039-1624226427.png).

Contrary to [his appearance](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1718172368-2008662872.png), he is a Daedra worshipper who travels the realms of Nirn and Oblivion constantly seeking more power as well as beings to use that power on.

She can be found in the [War Quarters in Blackreach](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:War_Quarters). The War Quarters is a small building located near the Blackreach Arena, just next to the path. She uses most of the destruction spells added by this mod, and as a reward for beating her you can acquire the spell tomes for them and also the spell tome for summoning her, as these spell tomes are in her inventory. She has many useful perks, wears a set of Daedric Armour, and she has heavy armour skill and perks to use the armour properly. She easily brings down Dremora Lords and even Keepers from the Soul Cairn. 
  
  
**Flaming Werewolf:** A [special kind of werewolf](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1694092063-905715056.png) with a surprisingly sad past. Once a happy man in full control of his lycanthropy, he has been reduced to a mindless killer, praying to the gods who no longer listen to please end his life. Sadness aside, this beast is savage and powerful, dealing strong and fiery blows with explosive power. [Found on the island of Solstheim, a ways to the North of Fort Frostmoth](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1700708172-702642970.png). 
  
  
**Vampiric Blood Emperor:** An ancient vampire who has achieved complete dominance over blood. Wields devastating blood draining spells as well as a [blood-red sword](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1714407347-323492656.png) which possesses the same dominance over blood, allowing it to drain blood from its targets at an alarming rate. This vampire is found in [Mara's Eye Den, under Mara's Eye Pond, South-West of Windhelm](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1709103735-1466363522.png). 
  
  
**Strange Dragon Priest:** A [unique dragon priest](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1718168551-1658700014.png) who has mastered destruction magic to such a degree that he has learned to break energy down to its simplest and most powerful form, and freely manipulate it. He wields devastating raw energy spells that benefit from all six Augmented element perks, and a spell that drains life energy from his enemies. He is found in [the Abandoned Prison](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1709103841-1659081692.png). 
  
  
**Undead King:** An undead being, [found on an island in the Sea of Ghosts, far to the West, just slightly to the South and East of Castle Volkihar,](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1694092203-872270278.png) on an island surrounded by rocky cliffs. [He is guarded by numerous skeleton guards](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1694092053-810530379.png), who are themselves no ordinary skeletons; a single one can defeat a Dremora Lord. The Undead King himself is an entirely new level of terror. He is stronger than all of his guards combined, and then some. [Perpetually surrounded in a deadly blizzard](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1748359070-2031382542.png), and dealing freezing strikes which feel like the full fury of winter's wrath, this monster is truly a deadly opponent. 
  
  
**Diabolical Spirit:** An [otherworldly entity lacking any noticeable body and wreathed in fire and darkness](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1743427388-493017750.png). The mere presence of this being is a death sentence for all but the strongest of heroes, and the devastating fire attacks with [his mace](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1743426483-1701102101.png) can make even the mightiest fall. As if this wasn't terrifying enough, he can also [bring other versions of himself to his side, forcing you to fight several of him at once](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/78458/78458-1743427031-160622688.png). He is guarded by ten spirits not too different from himself, as well as several unique bodyguards, each stronger than a Dremora Lord in its own right, but to compare their strength to his is to compare a single drop to the entire ocean; this entity is a monster beyond all reckoning, preparing to make the entire world his own. He is found in Blackreach City, under the dwarven gong used to summon the dragon [Vulthuryol](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Vulthuryol), or in simpler terms, the giant glowing orb. This creature is the ultimate boss of this mod, with even the Undead King being barely strong enough to slow him down. This monster is a terrifying challenge.
