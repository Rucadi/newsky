[size=6]**Depths of the Soul**

**Introduction:**
  
Depths of the Soul centres around Pike, a dungeon delving merchant who sells vital goods for the ruins ahead. Pike is not a simple or one-dimensional vendor and offers a real motivation for his line of work. Purchasing his good and interacting with him will allow the player to uncover the complex and troubled past that he harbours.
  
  
**Features****:**
  

  
* **Unique questline.** Learn Pike's troubled and mysterious past as he divulges more and more information each encounter. Along with uncovering this mystery, the player will have the opportunity to express themselves emotionally and even open up to this callous NPC.

  
* **[size=2][b]Interesting NPC.**[/b][/size][size=2]Vendors within Skyrim are often only there to serve the player and offer no other means [/size][size=2]of contributing to the world aside from this fact. Pike instead offers a [/size][size=2]much more realistic and immersive approach to this system where he has his own ambitions and wants, and with your help he can attempt to reach them.[/size]

* [size=2]**Fully voiced.**The mod features some incredible voice acting done by [size=2][size=2][size=2][size=2][Juniper Berry](https://huberd.carrd.co/)
[/size][/size][/size]! With 160 lines of fully voiced dialogue, they did a fantastic job at capturing this difficult character.[/size]

How can I find him?
