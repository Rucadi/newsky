**Details**This is a port of [Savos Aren's Regrets LE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/108000) which was backported from Savos Aren's Regrets SE, which got deleted for reasons unknown to me. Original by vagonumero12 was backported by dodolkecik to LE and now ported to SE by me again. Original permissions by vagonumero12 were open, stating:[size=3]
  
> No need to ask for permission to upload the mod to Bethesda.net or any other place, convert it to consoles or backport it to Skyrim LE. Do with it as you wish, except selling it.

[/size]I'm not the original author, I just ported this to SE, converted form43 to form44, compacted formids, repacked the BSA and flagged the ESP as ESL. I brought this back to SE since it was dearly missed here. I do intent to fully support this mod, so if there are any bugs please tell me and I will try to fix them.

[size=4]**Info from the original modpage:**[/size][/size][/size]**> [size=3]This mod restores cut content from the quest "The Staff of Magnus". The cut content consists of 7 scenes with (modern) Savos ghost, that will play after the visions scene of the past. They are all fully voiced in the user language.
>   
>   
> Incompatibilities: the mod is incompatible with any mod that edits the "The Staff of Magnus" quest (MG07).
>   
>   
> Known mod to edit MG07: Cutting Room Floor.
>   
> Cutting Room Floor only edits MG07 to keep the college guard in the bridge. If you load my mod after CRF, the only CRF functionality you will lose is that. If you load my mod before CRF, then weirdness will happen :)
>   
>   
> So, if you have CRF, I suggest to make sure that my mod gets loaded after it, regardless of what LOOT or any other tool says.
>   
>   
> Precautions:
>   
> don't install the mod if the quest "The Staff of Magnus" is already running. Note that the quest starts before being shown in the journal. To be safe, check with console command: "getquestrunning MG07". If the result is 1, then don't install my mod in that save.**
