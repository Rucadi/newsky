*"The Digitals say we come from another star, but so many have forgotten. I have not, for my lineage granted me audience with Memory, and I have spoken with the Wheels of Lull. I have seen proof, as any who come Up during Landfall Season, when the winds die down enough Above that all may make pilgrimage under the banner of Vehk and Vehk. Though many Above have renounced Memory, they too remember."*
  
  
Far, far below Nirn, past the lava flows and the still-mining machines of the dwarves, lies the great Clockwork City of Sotha Sil. Two centuries ago, an individual stepped through its nonexistent gates, forever changing it and its residents. From his actions came the Chronographers, the fabricant time-keepers, and watchers of the world. Since those two centuries they have lived in the great voidyards and helipads of their ruined city, silently guarding the world from danger.
  
But now, deep beneath the Throat of the World, in the most destitute of their outposts, something dangerous is stirring, and the rejected and broken Chronographers of Lull-Mor find that they have no choice but to seek outside help, and once again bring a mortal hero into the depths of the Clockwork City, to stop a mad mystic and his army of twisted experiments from unmaking the very foundations of the world! So once again, descend into the Expanse of Sotha Sil, and once again, turn the Wheels of Lull.
  
 
  
The Wheels of Lull is an enormous, sprawling expansion sized quest mod that serves not just only as a sequel to Sotha Sil Expanded, but ties together almost all my previous Skyrim quest mods, including Aethernautics, Mzark, and even Brhuce Hammar. In it, the player is recruited into the ranks of a rejected Chronographer platoon and shunted off to the Clockwork City outpost of Lull-Mor, a precariously perched outpost at the edge of Sotha Sil's domain.
  
Much like Sotha Sil Expanded, the mod gives a focus on puzzle and problem-solving. Featuring five enormous dungeons, with mini-bosses, unique treasures, and plenty of puzzles, you'll have your work cut out for you. The player will find themselves exploring strange new landscapes, from the deepest oceans, to underground forests, to giant foundries, and going up against strange new monsters, while wielding several new weapons, from the Harquebuses of Chronographers, to the great Unwinder of Goveri. They will find themselves dressing in Chronographer robes. WoL also serves as an introduction to the stranger side of TES lore, diving into the strange and ridiculous world of TES metaphysics, and will teach players about the Towers, Landfall, and the eponymous Wheels of Lull.
  
  
**Features:**
  

  
* An expansive main quest, stretched out over seven parts, with puzzles, infiltration, poltergeists, mad science, and butter.
Five dungeons within the main quest, complete with fleshed-out boss battles, and massive, unique locations, focusing on nonlinear design, reminiscent of the Legend of Zelda
  
* A new town, complete with extensive characters, moving parts, and little fabricants bugs.
Over seven sidequests within Lull-Mor, once again involving puzzle-solving, obstacle courses, and the player's wits, rather than combat. Take to the deep sea, warp through magical gates, and discover the horrors of
  
* New weapons, from clockwork drills, beam swords, lightning rods, and of course, the favorite of all Chronographers, the Harquebus, early era rifles that accelerate magical bolts.
Several new armors and equipment, from chronographer robes to life-saving security packs, to heavy suits of powered clockwork armor.
  
* A new race, the deranged and experimentuous fabricants, the living machine-mer of Sotha Sil!
Characters from both SSE and past games reappearing, as well as ones only spoken of in the deepest whispers of lore.
  
* *\*New 5.1.0* - SkyUI Mod Configuration Menu (MCM) to adjust various mechanics in the mod to your liking.
*\*New 5.1.0* - Fully navmeshed and follower friendly

**The Trainwiz ChronoC0da:**[/u]Wheels of Lull is actually part of an overarching series of mods, beginning with Sotha Sil Expanded for Morrowind. 
  
The following is an official list of the order the mods occur in:
  

  
1. [Blackreach Railroad](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/435)
[Brhuce Hammar: Legacy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47605)
  
2. [Aethernautics: A Space Travel Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/436?)
[The Lost Wonders of Mzark](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40674)
  
3. [Fyr Manor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51917)
[Dwemer Spectres](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8016)
  
4. [The Wheels of Lull (you are here)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/748/)
     
   ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿

  
**Optional Requirements/Suggested Mods:**

  
* **[Skyrim Script Extender](http://skse.silverlock.org/)﻿** - As of v5.1.0, some (though very few) SKSE script functions are used. These don't drastically effect gameplay and will just create harmless papyrus errors if you don't have it. Also required for SkyUI. Honestly, why wouldn't you at this point...
**[SkyUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12604)﻿** - Enables use of Mod Configuration Menu.
  
* **[Better Jumping SE/AE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18967)﻿﻿ -** It's well known that this mod requires some jumping (we're working on improving collision of objects you currently jump over), and this mod helps a lot with that. SKSE plugin that's configurable in an .ini file. Mayor thoroughly enjoys using it on entire playthroughs.

**Installation and Playing:**
  
  
Install using Vortex, Mod Organizer 2, Kortex Mod Manager - or any mod manager capable of running FOMOD installers.
  
  

  
* To start the mod, you must first be level 20. Yes, there are level requirements. You must be level 20 to start, level 35 to finish. *This was changed in version 5.1.0, all requirements went up 4-5 levels.*
Level requirements: Deep Down requires level 20, Mer in the High Castle requires 25, Brass Forest requires level 30, and Bottom of the World requires level 35.
  
* When you meet these requirements, travel to any settlement that is open, that is, any settlement aside from the main five cities. A strange-looking mer will approach you, and your quest will begin.
This mod does not require shouts, but I've found they help enormously. What really helps though, is exploring your environment and getting to know the Chronographers, as many will offer advice or equipment on your quest. Don't be afraid to explore!
  
* You do not need to have played Sotha Sil Expanded or my other mods to understand the plot of this mod, but events and characters will make more sense if you have.
