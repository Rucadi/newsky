**Behind and Beyond - Quest Mod**

**Introduction:**
  
Behind and Beyond is a short quest mod pulled from another of my mods, Memorable Dragons. This short adventure aims to remedy the lack of friendly and interesting dragons within Skyrim. The mod accomplishes this by adding in a new dragon, Mindokhinpaal who, unlike his kin, he does not seek violence and will instead send the player all over Skyrim with challenging riddles. Upon their completion, the player will be able to learn about not only the dragon's past and the various mortals he has met but also the history of the locations you will journey to.
  
  
**Features:**

  
* **Unique idea.** The concept of this quest hadn't been done at the time it was released and it continues to be the only mod with this unique premise. By solving Mindokhinpaal's riddles you'll learn all about Skyrim's past and the figures that shaped it into what it is today, all in an entertaining and challenging experience.
[size=2]**Unique models.** The dragon, Mindokhinpaal, has a unique appearance taken from the DDC3 mod which reinforces his status as a unique and peaceful entity. The quest reward you'll eventually receive, also has a unique model made by [billyro](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/billyro?gameId=1704)﻿ along with a special enchantment.[/size]
  

  
* **Fully voiced.** Behind and Beyond, while originally made nearly two years ago still features incredibly high quality voice acting by [size=2][size=2][BigMacHornet](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/23634254)[/size]! He also helped to write this mod and make it what it is today![/size]

  
**Showcase:**
  
  
  
**FAQ:**Can the mod be downloaded mid-game?
  

  
* **Yes, it's completely fine to install mid-game.**

Is it ESLed?
  

  
* **It is thanks to CharderoTheLupe!**

Is the mod clean?
  

  
* **Yes, I have only edited the necessary cells, there should be no conflicts due to dirty edits.**

How do I start the quest?
  

  
* **You must either progress through the Main Quest until you reach the end of Ustengrav. OR if you've gotten past that part, simply pulling the chain lever to access Jurgen's tomb will enable the dragon. He can then be met at Dead Man’s Respite.**

Why did you remake this mod?
  

  
* **If you're familiar with my work, you may know that I do not like Memorable Dragons due to a variety of reasons. The main one being its buggy nature and the sub-par quality of writing featured in it. This release was brought about as I wanted users to have the opportunity to play a quest that still holds up to my standards, without having to download Memorable Dragons. I may do the same for some of the other quests in the mod but I am still unsure.**

Will this mod work with Memorable Dragons?
  

  
* **No, it won't. As stated here and on the original mod page, I do not like that mod and I do not recommend people to play with it. This release is a way to still bring friendly dragons to Skyrim without having to deal with the rest of the bugs.**

What does this mod fix from the old quest?
  

  
* **This version fixes bugs encountered with enemies attacking the dragon and stopping his flight, fixes a bug with the dragon's appearance not working, fixes a bug with the weapon mesh not working properly and many others.**

What if I can't figure out the riddles?
  

  
* **Check the Docs tab for that information.**

Can I make a patch for the mod?
  

  
* **I'd love if people made patches for any incompatibilities that arise, if** **you could send these to me I'll upload them onto the mod page**

Can it be ported to Xbox?
  

  
* **[b][size=2]The original porter who would do all of my mods can no longer do it. If you're up to it and agree to give credit along with including my showcases on the page, I have no problems with you porting it.**[/b][/size]

How can I show my support?
  

  
* **You can endorse the mod and vote it for mod of the month, if you like the** **content. And if you'd like to support me, check out my YouTube and** **Patreon!**

  
**Bugs/Incompatibilities:**

  
* If you're running any version PRIOR to the update, please download [BEES](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441)﻿
