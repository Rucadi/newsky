Fully-voiced add-on for [Jarl Balgruuf Dilemma](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41132) by simtam.
  
  
Features
  
  

  
* You can now actively persuade Balgruuf to join the Imperials, in addition to the base option from JBD of persuading him to join the Stormcloaks.
FOMOD installer to select Balgruuf's "default" behaviour (you can still persuade him to choose either side during the discussion scene), rather than automatically siding with the Imperials.[list]
  
* *"Default Random"* - Balgruuf will join a side in the Civil War at random (50% chance) if you do not convince him through dialogue.
*"Default Always Imperial"* - you can convince him through dialogue to go Stormcloak, but Balgruuf will always side Imperial (like vanilla) by default.
  
* *"Default Always Stormcloak"*  - you can convince him to go Imperial, but he will always side Stormcloak by default.
*"Default Always Allied"* - you can convince him to choose either side, but he will always side with you by default.
  
* *"Default Always Opposed"* - you can convince him to choose either side, but he will always side against you by default.

  
[\*]If Balgruuf joins the Imperials, Message to Whiterun and Battle for Whiterun progress normally, as they do in vanilla Skyrim.
  
[\*]If Balgruuf joins the Stormcloaks:

  
* Message to Whiterun no longer ends immediately (as it does in JBD), and the dialogue scene with Proventus and Irileth will come to a natural conclusion.
Additional objectives and dialogue have been added to Message to Whiterun where you must inform General Tullius of Balgruuf's decision to side with Ulfric.
  
* A full scene has been added between General Tullius and Legate Rikke when you return from Whiterun if you're playing for the Imperials.
A full scene has been added between Balgruuf and Hjornskar Head-Smasher when you return from Solitude if you're playing for the Stormcloaks.
  
* A full Battle for Whiterun defense quest is now available for the Stormcloaks, including new scenes with Galmar (before the battle), and Balgruuf (after the battle).
An updated Battle for Whiterun attack quest for the Imperials, originally unlocked with JBD, including a new scene with Rikke (before the battle), and additional dialogue between Balgruuf and Hrongar (after the battle).
  

  
[\*]Dragon Rising has been re-added as a prerequisite, since Hrongar and Vignar don't have dialogue for that quest, and therefore can't replace Balgruuf before that quest is done.

  
* Please use [Whiterun without Main Quest](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/87903/) to restore this functionality with a fully-compatible way to separate the Civil War from the Main Quest.

  
[\*]Commander Sinmir is now properly titled "Commander" after he takes over the Whiterun guard from Commander Caius (and he will keep the title even if Caius returns).
  
[\*]The "hidden" Whiterun Imperial Camp (near Rorikstead) is present in the world before Jarl Balgruuf picks a side in the Civil War (from my Oldrim mod [Neutral Whiterun Imperial Camp](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/91934)﻿).
  
[\*]Various minor grammatical tweaks to Jarl Balgruuf Dilemma dialogue text, NPC titles, and objective text.
  
[\*]Various tweaks and fixes by JBD scripts to enable the siege quests to work are superseded by direct edits to vanilla scripts instead.
  
[\*]A few tweaks to the progress of objectives and stages for all Civil War Siege quests for consistency (shared across my Civil War mods).
