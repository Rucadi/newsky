Some small tweaks to the quest Missing In Action so it makes more sense. The quest always felt like it has pacing issues, from the very first time I played Skyrim many years ago.
  
  
Vanilla:
  
- Marketplace scene with Frilia and the two Battleborns has no conditions so it always plays when you enter Whiterun for the first time (after watching two or three other scripted scenes)
  
- The peaceful route requires getting an Imperial Order from General Tullius, the condition for which is that you must have joined the Legion.
  
  
My tweaks:
  
- Marketplace scene with Frilia and the two Battleborns only plays after completing Diplomatic Immunity.
  
- The peaceful route requires getting an Imperial Order from General Tullius, the condition for which is that you are Thane of Solitude.
  
- The line that Eorlund says about Frilia thinking Thorald is alive only plays after completing Diplomatic Immunity.
  
  
Diplomatic Immunity seemed like a good condition, partly because one of the guests during that mission says: ""Well, there might be nothing to it, but I've heard that the feud between the Gray-Manes and the Battle-Borns in Whiterun has grown ugly. Fralia Gray-Mane is convinced that the Battle-Borns have abducted one of her sons." Almost feels like this was the actual intended kick-off for the quest..
  
  
In my console testing with setstage everything worked. I'm using Favor252 (Thane of Haafingar) stage 20 => for the condition check with General Tullius. Stage 20 of Favor252 doesn't technically complete the quest (you still need to return to Elisif after buying Proudspire manor) so if anyone has a better suggestion I'm open for it.
  
  
Compatible with USSEP / Cutting Room Floor. Load my file after, obviously.
  
  
Inspired by [Missing in Action Delayed](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67893) and [Missing in Action Delayed - Level and Quest Requirement](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/87931)﻿, but both those mods didn't do exactly what I wanted.
