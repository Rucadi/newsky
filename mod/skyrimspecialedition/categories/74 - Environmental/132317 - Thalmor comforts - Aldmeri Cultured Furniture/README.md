Concept
  
Kelretu's resource pack contains Aldmeri themed furniture, and as a fan of mods that enhance the various cultures from around Tamriel I decided to mod in these lovely pieces of furnishings in location occupied by Skyrim's most well known Altmer organization: the Thalmor. These elves come to Skyrim in righteous zeal in stamping out Talos worhip, maintain the Concordat and influence the events of Skyrim in their favor. There is no reason they cannot do these things in comfort, so they brought shipments of lavish furniture from their homeland to do their duties in comfort.
  
  
For the locations in cities effected by the Civil War, like Understone Keep and the Justiciars Headquarters, there will be changes when the Stormcloaks take over the city. The Thalmor supplies will be confiscated in Understone Keep, and the Stormcloaks will requisition the Justiciar Headquarters for supplies and aid to help Solitude rebuild.
  
  
Effected Cells
  
Several locations that have a heavy Thalmor presence and are their bases of operations which also show of their wealth and influence. These have most if not all of their furniture replaced.
  
*(These locations have their furniture changed and moved to allocate for change in size. Sometimes navmesh have been edited as well.)*

The Thalmor have several agents spread around Skyrim, like Ancano and Ondolemar, who brought some of their supplies to the places they occupy. These locations have a chest for the agent(s) that are located there:

Compatibility
  

  
* JK Understone Keep - The added chest does not interfere
Elven Supremacy: The containers automatically are populated with Sancars. I am researching updating Ancano and Ondolemars chests to use them as well. For now I think that they also need some regular septims during their operations.
  

  
Future plans
  
I am investigating making the Thalmor Headquarters reactive to Civil War events, with a Stormcloak victory clearing out the tower in Castle Dour and replacing it with supplies. Similarly once Ondolemar or Ancano are dead their travel chests might also be removed. I will not touch the Embassy or Northwatch Keep, as those locations are purposefully not linked to Civil War outcomes in the same way.
