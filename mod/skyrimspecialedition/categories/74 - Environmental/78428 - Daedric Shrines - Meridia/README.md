Original voice actor is great, but If you want to something new I recommend this mod - [Meridia Revised - A New Voice](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86483) . I think it fits my statue better.﻿
  
  
**p.s. Please upload your fancy images ;) Always happy to see how my statues look on different setups.**
  
  
**Tools****: Sculpted in zbrush, textured in substance 3d painter.**
