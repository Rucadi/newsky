[font=Tahoma]MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING THE LATEST VERSION OF PILGRIM
  
  
I recommend starting a new game with this because it edits some persistent references[/font]

INFO[/font]

[Pilgrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54099)﻿ introduces Daedric shrines in various parts of the world. For consistencies sake I've replaced some shrines with their counterpart from ﻿ [Daedric Shrines - All in One](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78772)﻿ while also making them interactable to receive Pilgrim blessings. I've also added\tweaked around clutter to make it just a bit more fitting in my opinion. 
  
  
I've included an optional version for those of you who wish to use [Statue of Sithis](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73735)﻿
  
  
I've also included "Molag Bal - Not a Replacer patch" from [Daedric Shrines - All in One - My Patches by Xtudo](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78809)because I think it's placement is better than my previous attempt. Thank you for your permission, Xtudo!
