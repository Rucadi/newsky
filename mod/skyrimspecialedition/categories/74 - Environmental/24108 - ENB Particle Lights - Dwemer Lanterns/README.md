# ENB Particle Lights - Dwemer Lanterns

I'm crazy about the new Complex Particle Lights in ENBSeries.  It looks amazing on pretty much anything that glows, so I added them to all of the Dwemer lanterns, chandeliers, wall-lights, etc. that you find in Dwemer dungeons.
  
  
It's a subtle effect, but for us detail freaks, every little thing matters!  Check the ON\OFF shots in the images to see. This uses a single "static" particle and should be very performance-friendly.
  
  
This only alters meshes, so it's compatible with any texture replacers that do not also alter the same meshes.
  
  
KNOWN CONFLICTS:
  

  
* Ancient Dwemer Metal (it alters the meshes to apply a shiny cubemap.)  You can overwrite ADM with these if you don't mind losing some shine on a couple objects.

This requires a more recent version of ENBSeries for Skyrim Special Edition that has the complex particle lights effect.
