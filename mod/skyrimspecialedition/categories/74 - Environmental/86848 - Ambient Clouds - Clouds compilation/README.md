**Mod options**:
  

  
* pick what you want in the installer. From different all-in-one merges, to **purist merges**, **less dense** versions, and all versions of each individual files that ever were.

  
Purist merge: purely environmental module that ticks all boxes
  
Less dense: 50% less density/visibility. Lighter clouds.
  
  
There is no performance impact with this mod.
  
  
This mod adds fogs, mists, and unique atmospheric effects when clustered together to many locations around the map and points of interest. Either for ornamental purposes, rougher climate impression, hidding bare rock lods and landscapes, illusion of scale and depth, ambience with a touch of fantasy.
  
You can choose from the installer a purist version.
  
  
The clouds colours change with weather and time. Enb or non enb play a major part in the desired effect. For vanilla I recommend the less dense versions.
  
Less dense options are clouds with 50% less visibility
  
  
The clouds are static, however they have expansive movement. The clouds cycle, they move, disappear, and appear in the same place.
  
Won´t block views.
  
No performance impact.
  
  
**L**od friendly
  
Clouds are full lod - you do not need to generate or re-generate lod for this.
  
They are visible from far away.
  
  
  
**L**oad order - Fully compatible. Use with any weather mod, fogs or mists.  Load interior lighting and water mods after this.
  
  
**RECOMMENDED to use with** [CS Particle Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/147270/)
