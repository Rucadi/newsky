# Cathedral - 3D Thicket and Dead Shrub

A 3d replacer for the horrendous dead thickets and shrubs. Only ~500 triangles, which is about double the vanilla count, but given that these models have absolutely no overdraw, they likely perform the same. Either way, 544 triangles is extremely low and will not affect performance.
