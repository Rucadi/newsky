This mod adds rainbows and moonbows to the game.
  
  
Rainbows appear if the weather changes from rainy to sunny within an hour between 7:00am and 10:30am or between 1:30pm and 5:00pm, with a default probability of 25% that can be adjusted using the console command:
  

```
set RainbowChance to [percentage]
```

  
Moonbows appear on nights with a full moon (happened 3 days every 24 days) if the weather meets the conditions between 8:00pm and 10:00pm or between 2:00am and 4:00am, with a default probability of 25% that can be adjusted using the console command: 
  

```
set MoonbowChance to [percentage]
```

  
The main differences between this mod and the original [Rainbows SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73085)﻿ are:
  

  
* The script has been remade (the original version is buggy and not very efficient).
The mod uses models from the [Wonders of Weather](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13044) (the original version's models were converted from LE and lacked a necessary component, which caused invisibility).
  
* ~~The mod uses 4K upscaled textures from [Rainbows 4K SE - Cleaned and Upscaled Textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74525)﻿.~~
The textures from [Rainbows 4K SE - Cleaned and Upscaled Textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74525) are removed according to [XilaMonstrr](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/126616023)'s request. Now I use textures upscaled from the original [Wonders of Weather](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13044) by myself. The options including 1K, 2K, 4K and even 8K. (Note that you don't need to worry high resolution textures will smash your potato since there will be only one rainbow at the same time. However, high resolution textures do take more disk spaces.)

Here are the steps to make the rainbows appear manually:
  

  
* Set the prossibility to 100%, go to an exterior open space and wait the proper time
Open console and type

```
﻿fw 10a242
```

  
* Close console and wait a few seconds
Open console and type

```
﻿fw 81a
```

  
* Close console and you should see the rainbow/moonbow on the opposite position of the sun/moon.

  
Compability:
  

  
* Not compatible with the original version [Rainbows SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73085)﻿ and [Wonders of Weather](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13044)
Should be compatible with any other mods including weathers, enbs, etc.
  
* Retexture mods of the original version need a few changes on the file path

  
This mod is ESL flagged so it does not count into the esp count limit.
  
  
Mid-Game Switch:
  
Users of [Rainbows SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73085)﻿ can switch to this mod midgame, just disable the old one and enable this and **use resaver to clean your save**, I did so in my own save and it works.
