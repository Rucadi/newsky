Made this for my game and wanted to share. Mix this with nice Gildergreen and flower mods and it's super cozy.
  
  
Hedges are from [Witcher Plants Resource Pack - Hedge and Rhododendrons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/132962) by Elrian.
  
  
They have autumn and winter variants for [Seasons of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62861). If you don't have SoS, you should still see the green/default hedge version. The snowy version is just me trying to add snowflakes via Photoshop. They fit in with my game (ENB is Silent Horizons 2). 
  
  
I did move a mountain flower that was positioned near a trellis/stream so it wouldn't clip with the hedges. Otherwise no other changes made. 
  
  
You can't walk through the hedges but I did see Danica jump spots to get water from the stream outside the temple (I think it's immersive interactions). She completed her task and kept going with her day so I'm not too worried.
  
  
I also am not sure how things go with the siege. I saw some damaged parts of the city overlying the hedges. I'm assuming things will just clip through at that point but these are bushy hedges and it makes sense for a beam of wood or similar to stick through them.

Anyway, let me know if there are any concerns.
  
  
Enjoy :)
