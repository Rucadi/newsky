**BLENDED ROADS LESS BUMPINESS**
  
﻿

[font=Tahoma]This is such a silly idea that I didn't believe it would work hahaha...
  
All I did was use Base Object Swapper to move some road chunks down a bit to reduce bumpiness.
  
As it is done with BoS, there are **no landscape edits**, which makes it compatible with basically everything, including new lands mods.
  
  
**NOTE THAT**: This tweak does not **REMOVE** road bumpiness, it only **REDUCES** it.
  
  
It was applied to the problematic chunks globally, not individually, so in some areas you may notice one or two pebbles from the road being cut by the ground *(it's practically imperceptible anyways)*.
  
  
I did the tests with Blended Roads ***(really blended option)***.
  
I know it works with the standard version of Blended Roads, but I haven't tested it and I can't guarantee that the quality will be the same.
  
  
**According to users, it is also compatible with:**

RECOMMENDATION:
  
  
[Skyrim Road Reconstruction Project](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/103163)﻿: It also moves the chunks down, but individually, which is better.
  
 It is still being developed, so it does not cover all areas with road bumps.
