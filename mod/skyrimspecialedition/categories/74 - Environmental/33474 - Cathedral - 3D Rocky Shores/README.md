**Design**
  

  
* The rock models are distributed to the world as a "grass type."
The rock models have relatively low polygon counts but are still chamfered to give a smooth appearance.
  
* These rocks employ my [slope-restriction technique](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/brl9tl/so_i_discovered_how_to_inhibit_grass_from_growing/)﻿ so they will not bury campsites along the shore.

  
**Performance**
  

  
* Expect 0-2 FPS loss if you have a low-end to mid-range PC.

  
**Recommended Mods**
  

  
* [Cathedral Landscapes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21954)﻿ is recommended for matching the underlying landscape texture to the rocks, but it is not required.
