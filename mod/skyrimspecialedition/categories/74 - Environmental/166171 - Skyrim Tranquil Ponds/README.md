[font=Verdana]This mod adds lovely ponds that are scattered here and there throughout the Skyrim worldspace 
  
adding a bit of variety to the environment.
  
Skyrim Tranquil Ponds should not conflict with other mods, but if you encounter any issues, 
  
please report them in the comments section. I will create any necessary patches.
  
The FOMOD includes a CC Fishing integration plugin, allowing you to fish in peace while enjoying the relaxing scenery.
  
The mod is DynDOLOD-ready, so all you need to do is launch TexGen and DynDOLOD as usual.
  
Installation is pretty simple. Just use your favourite mod manager and place the plugin wherever you like, but make sure its before mods such as Realistic Water Two.
  
  
Skyrim Tranquil Ponds is compatible with any version of Skyrim
