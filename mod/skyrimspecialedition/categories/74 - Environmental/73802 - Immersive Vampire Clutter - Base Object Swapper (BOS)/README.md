# Immersive Vampire Clutter - Base Object Swapper (BOS)

Dawnguard introduced many vampire-related assets: blood puddles, blood kegs, blood potions, bloodied clothes, bloody tankards an so on, but we don't see any of it outside of Castle Volkihar. This mod fixes it by replacing vanilla clutter with their Dawnguard counterparts only in vampire lairs.
  
  
Even though this mod mainly replaces clutter, it also swaps some armors, drinks, food, ingredients, ingots, ores, potions and weapons for vampire themed counterparts. That way, you may find Dawnguard armors and weapons laying around instead of the standard Steel equipment, or maybe some poisonous flowers instead of the typical mountain flowers.
  
  
This mod only replaces items for *vampire lairs*. By that, I mean vampire themed castles, dungeons and houses (including player homes). It also includes some (but not all) mod places, like [Vigilant SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11849/) vampire dungeons.
  
  
If you have Creation Club content like Bloodchill Manor, Plague of the Dead, Rare Curios or Saints & Seducers, you may find extra clutter, ingredients and weapons. If you don't have some or any of them, the mod still works, but you won't find, for example, Daedra Venin, Mort Flesh or Poisoned Apples. It's not needed at all, it only adds some extra stuff.
  
  
List of items that this mod swaps:

  
* Alcohol for Blood Potions
Animal meat for Human Flesh or Mort Flesh
  
* Animal parts for human bones
Barrels, casks and kegs for their blood counterparts
  
* Baskets for Bloodchill Manor baskets
Bowls, Candlesticks, Cups, Goblets, Jugs, Plates and Pottery for their bloodied counterparts
  
* Buckets for Blood Buckets
Combat dummies for Bloodchill Manor Dawnguard dummies
  
* Common clothes for bloodied or vampire clothing
Common flowers for Deathbells, Gleamblossoms and Nightshades

Rare pelts for Werewolf Pelts
