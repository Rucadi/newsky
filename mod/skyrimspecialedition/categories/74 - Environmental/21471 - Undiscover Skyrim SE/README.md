The first main file of this mod removes the "DISCOVERED" part of the text popup that shows whenever you discover a new location.
  
The second main file does the same, but also removes the sound that plays when you discover a new location. Use only one main file.
  
There is also an optional file that just removes the sound, if you so desire.
  
  
- **Install** manually or with a mod manager, it's just one .esp file.
  
- **Uninstall** at any point by deleting the mod like you would any other.
  
- **Compatible** with every other mod in existence.
  
- **Load Order** doesn't matter, the mod is marked as an ESL which means it won't even take up a slot in your plugin list.
