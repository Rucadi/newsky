**This is a patch for [Origins Of Forest - 3D Forest Grass](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45719) - the original mod is needed.**
  
  
This patch reduces the sizes of some of the very large plants introduced by the mod. Giving you the same varieties and amounts but changing it from a jungle into a more moderate thicket.
  
  
The two attached pictures are no proper 1:1 comparison since the placement of individual plants is a bit random each time, but you get the idea.
  
  
It does so by making some few changes to the size parameters of the grass definitions in the original mod.
  
  
It does *not*:
  

  
* make any changes around which plants will be growing where
alter the meshes or the textures
  
* alter any grass ini-settings you might have

  
Currently compatible with versions 1.2.1 - 1.2.2 - 1.3 (any color option).
  
  

  
* ESL-flagged
Can be installed and removed any time mid-game.
  

  
Enjoy.
