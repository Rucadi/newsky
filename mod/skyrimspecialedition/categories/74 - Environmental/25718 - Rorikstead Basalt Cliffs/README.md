DESCRIPTION
  
  
Adds basalt cliffs and pine trees around Rorikstead, giving the town a unique atmosphere. It now feels like a distinct region of the Whiterun Hold with its proper environment.
  
  
  
COMPATIBILITY
  
  
I have tested this mod with [JK's Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6289)﻿ and [Arthmoor's Rorikstead](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16881)﻿, both are compatible out of the box. I've followed the vanilla structure of the cliffs for maximum compatibility, so it should work perfectly with any Rorikstead overhaul which doesn't touch the mountains around the town.
  
  
Version 1.2 : compatible with the Farming creation from the Creation Club. Added a few cliffs around the farm for consistency.
