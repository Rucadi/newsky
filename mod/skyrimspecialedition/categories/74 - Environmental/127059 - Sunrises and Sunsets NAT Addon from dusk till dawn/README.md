This is a personal mod that i decided to share
  
As i started to use NOLVUS ( NAT + Rudy, works also with Cabbage)
  
 i've implemented part of my Scandinavian Seasons idea into NAT 
  
This mod will add different and Unique Sunrises and sunsets  
  
- Dusks and Dawns to all meteo types
  
 ( clean, cloudy, fog, rain, snow, vulcanic )
  
This mod will only work with Nat-Enb (weather ) installed (master )
  
ESP Flagged Esl so will not take space in your load order
  
Added Support for NAT.CS ( community shaders Users )
