# Cathedral - 3D Pine Grass
- Author: The Community
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42032


**Performance:**
  
Significantly better performance than all other grass mods, including Cathedral Landscapes, allowing for higher density and more areas with grass. At default settings (imingrasssize=50), the performance is matched to Cathedral Landscapes (imingrasssize=60), which was matched to unmodded Skyrim. You can understand how I was able to accomplish this by reading one of my previous reddit posts on [grass performance studies](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/ik8hcz/a_review_of_grass_performance_studies_resolution/). 
  
  
**Compatibility:**
  
-Overwrite other grass mods with this mod.
  
-Overwrite Cathedral - 3D mountain flowers with this mod.
  
-Landscape fixes for grass mods is compatible but not necessary, as this mod implements its own fix. Explanation [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/brl9tl/so_i_discovered_how_to_inhibit_grass_from_growing/).
  
-Created for and tested in VR.
