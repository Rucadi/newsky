[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]**Overview**
  
[/font][font=Lucida Sans Unicode]I was playtesting my new mod list and I stopped by Ivarstead. Whilst taking a look at the river I noticed the river starting from the muddy embankment. This is just not realistic! The main river in Skyrim starting by magic. This river flows both North and East, in the east there is a large lake which has two outflows with waterfalls as well as continuing on to Riften.
  
  
I could not find any mod that corrects this immersion breaking oversight so decided to do something about it. (Yes I am now aware that another mod adds a single waterfall, judging by the images what I have done is more extensive and I feel more realistic).
  
  
I have made this for myself and wanted to share it with the community. Based on some comments already I am less inclined to do that in the future - you have been warned.
  
  
  
**What does The Falls of Ivarstead contain?**
  
  
The Falls of Ivarstead is a simple mod that **adds several waterfalls** to the mountains behind Ivarstead. These falls now feed the river in both directions, creating a realistic source, powerful enough to feed a fast flowing rivers and lakes. **Effects have been added to the river** to show a faster flows. The river now has the effect of moving swiftly towards the two outlets of Lake Geir.
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
  
Mods that adds or changes anything in the river around Ivarstead may need patching - they will work but you may notice clipping.
  
  

  
* Compatible with texture mods
Compatible with any water mods (load them after this file).
  
* Compatible with Majestic Mountains.
New with version two some enhanced compatibility no longer needs patch for JK's Skyrim.
  
* Should be compatible with mods that alter land near the river

  
  
With Natural Waterfalls you may not get their updated assets, thanks [Skotnikov](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/8808702) for reporting it. 
  
  
Not compatible with:
  
  

  
* [font=Lucida Sans Unicode][Ivarstead Source](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/118825?tab=description) as it makes similar changes in roughly the same location.[/font]
[font=Lucida Sans Unicode][Thuldor's Ivarstead](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99494?tab=description) - makes significant changes around the river. (Version two might be more compatible)[/font]
  

  
Old game version
  
  
If you are playing on an old version ie pre-anniversary then you will need to use  [BEES (Backported Extended ESL Support)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441) or edit the version number of the mods in your load order.
  
  
Installation
  
  
The files are marked as ESLs so will not take a plugin slot.
  
  
Install with a mod manger to the data folder.
  
  
Safe to install midgame
  
  
Does not contain scripts so it might be safe to uninstall midgame.
  
  
Updating from version 1
  
Don't as I have built this from scratch that means it will not contain the same FormIDs.
  
  
**Future plans**
  
  
I intend to check other locations and if it makes sense add water sources.
  
  
**Patches?**
  
  
I do not have any intention of patching other city mods as I simply do not use them. I am happy for others to create patches providing this mod is required as a master, I am also happy to host other patches.
  
  
Other stuff
  
  
Inspiration
  
  
I came up with this idea on my own. I have been told that there is some video on YouTube looking at Skyrim Rivers - I have not seen this nor used any other mod in creation or inspiration.
  
  
 Comments
  
  
I welcome constructive feedback, bug reports, or highlighting conflicts - I can't promise to be able to help or make patches for everything but I will try where possible. I will highlight any incompatibilities on the description.
  
  
Troll, offensive or inappropriate comments will be removed and the user will be banned from my content.
  
  
Further comments on the originality of this mod will be deleted. Quite frankly I created this for myself and wanted to share it - I am now less inclined to do so in future.[/font][/font]
