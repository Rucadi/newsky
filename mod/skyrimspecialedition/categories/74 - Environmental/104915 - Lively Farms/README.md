Have you ever wondered where tomatoes, apples and carrots come from? Even though they are present as consumable foods, they never appear in farmers' fields. Lively Farms brings more variety to farms by adding pear and apple trees, growing carrots and tomato plants. With pears now you can create new sweets,
  
all perfectly integrated into the Skyrim food crafting system.
  
  
If you have [Producers of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61123)﻿ installed and the patch provided by Lively Farms FOMOD, farmers will sell you the crops/fruit they actually grow in their farm.
  
  
You can choose between two versions, the classic one and the new "dynamic loot no physics". In the latter the fruits can be collected as if they were harvestable plants,
  
if you use the [Dynamic Looting and Harvesting Animations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/114547)﻿ mod by GiraPomba it will be possible to have dynamic animations for harvesting all the fruits from Lively Farms (apples, pears, tomatoes and carrots).
