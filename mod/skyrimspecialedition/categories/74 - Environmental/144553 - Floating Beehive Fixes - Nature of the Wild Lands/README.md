Floating beehives have been bothering me since installing Nature of the Wild Lands so I decided to fix it for my game and I'm sharing it here in case anyone else is interested. 
  
  
There are several different files on offer, as I broke the beehives up by tree type in case folks are using a mix of different tree mods. The vast majority of beehives are on Pine-type trees, with one or two each on Reach trees, TundraDriftwood trees, Pine Shrubs, and Aspen trees. Download and install the files you need to fix your Nature of the Wild Lands beehives.
  
  
**Requirements**
  
This mod requires [Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805).
  
  
**What beehives are fixed?**
  
All vanilla beehives and vacant beehives that are supposed to be attached to a tree. There are several which hang from cave roofs or structures that needed no adjustments. Mod-added beehives will not be adjusted by this mod and would require their own BOS file patch. A patch for the three beehives added by [Cutting Room Floor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/276) is available, as well as a patch for [Beyond Skyrim: Bruma](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10917) beehives.
  
  
**Will you do other tree mods too?**
  
Maybe! Some of them might not need adjustment if they are close in size and shape to vanilla trees. If you use a different tree mod and you have floating vanilla beehives, let me know in the comments which tree type they are floating on and which mod. Check the stickied post for additional tree mods that are done. Also done are floating external bone chime traps [Bone Chimes Begone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/158222).
  
  
**I installed a file and I still have floating beehives!**
  
I tested all files on a new game and all of the beehives moved to the appropriate places. If you still see floating beehives, make sure it's installed correctly, and you're not getting an error in your BOS error log, or you don't have another BOS file or mod touching beehives (texture and/or model replacers without a .esp are fine). Also, if you have a mod that changes the treescale beyond what is in the base mod, or have manually changed treescales, the beehives will no longer align. These files can be installed/uninstalled on existing games with no issues. If everything is installed correctly, open the console, click the misbehaving beehive, and type in "recycleactor" which should force it to the correct position.
  
  
**Can I combine the BOS files I need into one file for my game?**
  
Sure can!
  
  
**Thanks**
