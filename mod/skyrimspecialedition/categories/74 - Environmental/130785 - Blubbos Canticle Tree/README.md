I created this tree to replace the Canticle tree. Because of the BSTriLodshape mesh in the original file, I changed the texture of the original tree to make the branches invisible and modeled the new tree over it.
  
Unfortunately I don't know how to re-integrate the BSTriLodShape after the blender export, so I did this away. This way the quest trigger remains and it looks like an independent tree.
  
  
I have been working on it for a few weeks and now I am happy with it and share it with you.
  
  
This small mod is stand-alone.
  
  
 It is not necessary for my regular Trees Variations mod, I have added a separate update with it.
  
  
(except for the Trees Variations noVanilla version, please also use the stand-alone version here).
