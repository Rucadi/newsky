# Seasonal Diverse Tundra Shrubs - Cathedral 3D and Mari's Flora

This mod came to be as a happy byproduct of the (rather large) seasonal flora mod I'm currently working on. While I was working on tundra shrubs and scrubs, DrJacopo happened to release his beautiful remake of vanilla tundra shrubs AND a scrub replacer - and I didn't want to choose between those and the work I'd done so far.
  
  
[size=3]Besides, more variety is always appreciated, right?
  
  
  
[/size]**What it does**
  
This mod combines assets from 3 different mods to give a more varied look to tundra shrubs. [size=3]I have tweaked pretty much every texture and mesh to my own taste and for greater harmony with Seasonal Landscapes' aesthetic, so nothing should stand out as too saturated or too bright.The green tundra shrub variants which looked a bit out of place in a brown autumn setting now appear as 3D Stonecrop, which has more subtle green foliage.
  
  
  
UPDATE
  
[size=3][color=#00ffff]No longer requires Seasonal Landscapes[/size]
  
Two colour options are now available[/color]:
  
  
**Spring Greens** - Green shrubs are much more common in spring and summer, also lighter green in spring. Fewer red shrubs in general. Spring and summer are more differentiated. Slightly more variation in winter also. See screenshots for a better idea.
  
  
**Original Colours** - See older screenshots. Please note, [size=3][size=3]shrubs stay the same colours in spring and summer.[/size][/size]
  
  
Use one main file, not both.
  
  
  
As for those pesky tundra s**C**rubs (which the Cathedral 3D Stonecrop mod originally replaces), I have made another mod to deal with those, linked below under "Recommended". Both this mod and the recommended mod were made side by side and are intended to be used together; the preview screenshots show both together.

**Credits**
  
I couldn't have made this without the generous permissions of the asset creators:
  
  
**-** DrJacopo - [Cathedral 3D Tundra Shrubs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/108747) and [Cathedral 3D Stonecrop](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/110726)
  
**-** ICFur - [Cathedral 3D Tundra Shrubs - Alternate Textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/108892)
  
**-** Mari - [Mari's Flora](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45952) textures
  
  
**None of the above are required for this mod to work**, but please consider downloading and endorsing them for their hard work.
  
[size=3](Small caveat: if you install [Cathedral 3D Stonecrop](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/110726)﻿ alongside this mod, you will be seeing it even more frequently - maybe not your cup of tea)
  
[/size]
  
  
**Optimization**
  
ICFur's textures have been reduced to 512px (down from 2k), so they will eat far less VRAM. Due to DrJacopo's UV mapping design, there was no need in my opinion for such big textures. Mari's shrub variant still uses 2k textures, as these are based on vanilla design.
