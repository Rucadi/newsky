Hi everyone!
  
  
This mod overhauls Skyrim's rock cairns (regular and EVIL!) to be less blocky, more rocky (sorry about the rhyme), and with less obvious errors (seams) in the mesh's UVs. You could say it SMIMs the cairns. 
  
  
I've also replaced the vanilla skeleton pieces with bones from PraedythXVI's excellent[SkeletonReplacer HD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52845). I removed some less threatening bones (feet...so many feet...)and replaced them with more bloody and (in my opinion) scary bones (hips, shoulder blades, bloody skulls, etc.) The bones now sit on the rocks correctly too.
  
  
I've also replaced the vanilla blood splatters with ones that fit the cairns better and use textures from [odinsmods](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/64024781) awesome [Sanguine](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55282).Check out the pics in the gallery.
  
  
This is a mesh replacer only and therefore should work with any texture replacers you use. Install and uninstall at any point without any ill effects for your save.
  
  
Update 1.3 contains a mesh created by Kless Gyzen. It is used in accordance with a CC0 licence and was provided by Polyhaven.com.
