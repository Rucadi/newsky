# Better Blended Mushrooms
- Author: aelix
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

All mushroom meshes use landscape textures which results in visibly mismatched textures in mines and caves. This mod aims to fix that by replacing all types of mushrooms in interior locations with versions that use the correct corresponding textures.
  
  
Thanks to [Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805), this can be done with **zero** edits to vanilla records.
  
  
**Installation**
  
Download and install through your favorite mod manager. It is completely safe to install and uninstall this mod mid-save. This mod is ESL-flagged and will not take up a slot in your plugin limit. This mod requires [Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805).

**Compatibility**
  
This mod does not directly conflict with any other mod. However, using any mod that replaces meshes for mushrooms (such as [Realistic HD Mushrooms Remastered](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21996)) will result in the replaced mushrooms not matching the unaffected mushrooms.
  
  
This mod is compatible with all texture replacers, as the new meshes only change the texture paths. This mod was tested both with vanilla textures and with the textures included in [Caves HQ](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22277?tab=description) and [MD's Photoreal Mines](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32240).
  
  
This mod currently only affects vanilla locations.
