This mod hand places these new waterplants into the game.
  
  
**It requires the "\_ResourcePack.esl" file from the 1130 update!**
  
  
  
With the recent Skyrim 1130 update, Bethesda provided us with some new assets in the "\_ResourcePack.esl" file.
  
Some of those assets, were new Water Lilies and Duckweed which I've made use of.
  
  
  
I've always been a big fan of [Waterplants](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6092)﻿ by Halifax0815, and this mod takes heavy inspiration from that. The addition of water lilies in various bodies of water just adds some variety and life to the game. Most locations I've used are in similar locations to the ones in [Waterplants](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6092)﻿, with some additional locations as well.
  
**What's the difference between this and [Waterplants](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6092)?**
  
The lilies in "Waterplants" are quite large, more closely matching giant lily pads instead of your common lily pads. The water lilies I've places are much smaller than the ones in "Waterplants" (about 1/3 the size), so their appearance more closely resembles water lilies you might actually see in real life.
  
This means the clusters of lilies are smaller overall and more subtle.
  
I've also added some extra lilies to places where I felt they would fit in nicely.
  
These lilies and duckweed are also natively animated, so there's no need for an additional download.
  
  
In the pictures, you can see some direct side-by-side comparisons of these two mods and decide for yourself which you prefer.
  
  

  
* Lake Ilinalta in Falkreath has default sized lilies, but they like to cluster together in larger bunches. Being close together, they also have collected Duckweed under them.
Lake Honrich in Riften has slightly larger lilies (1.5x scale) due to the warmer climate. Being larger, they also don't bunch up quite as much and collect less Duckweed under them.
  
* Whiterun, Riften, and Markarth also have had some floral additions places inside the city proper.

  
For Seasons support, check out the [Seasonal Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/118601) by [Fallven](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Fallven/about-me?gameId=1704)﻿.﻿
  
  
  
  
The fomod installer allows you to pick one of two versions, optional BOS swap files, and a seperate addon to place additional critter spawn markers near lily pad clusters.
  
  
Optional BOS files let you:
  

  
* Randomize the colours you'll see.
Use alternative textures in the Rift from [Flora Additions - Waterplants - Seasonal Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/118601) ﻿without needing Seasons.
  
* Completely disable plant additions within the Rift.

  
  
You can choose the **Default** version, or the **Dense** version.
  

  
* **Default** version places 629 Lilies, 255 Duckweed, and about 208 landing markers for butterflies.
**Dense** version places 1564 Lilies, 1040 Duckweed, and about 519 landing markers for butterflies.
  

  
To properly make use of the critter landing markers, I also recommend using in combination with [Butterflies Unchained](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29538).﻿
  
  
  
  
This mod is ESL flagged and was made with latest CK, which means your game has to be updated to the current version as it also relies on the Resource Pack provided by Bethesda. It's also been reported to work if you've downgraded and use [Backported Extended ESL Support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441)
