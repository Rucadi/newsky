**~ Introduction ~**
  
This mod was created because of how uninteresting and uninspired the vanilla Sleeping Tree experience and location was (Sleeping Tree Camp). It was such a disappointment and so underwhelming!
  
  
No longer! This Sleeping Tree Overhaul aims to bring you an interesting and awe inspiring location full of tiny little details, character, uniqueness, and magical mystery. 
  
  
The ancient and mystifying Hist tree has a foreboding sound that draws you to its presence. The tree is now truly worthy of an Argonian’s reverence. 
  
  
  
**~ Features****~**
  
- a truly unique sleeping Hist tree model
  
- a larger pond of water
  
- hanging vines, hanging tribal lanterns
  
- subtle swarms of insects flying around the lanterns
  
- hanging Hist flowers and wind chime
  
- glowing underwater roots
  
- mysterious low swirling fog
  
- carved cairns and rune circle
  
- a place to sit cross legged to honor tree 
  
- ESL flagged
  
- LOD included
  
- a custom sound fx that adds an eerie and foreboding creaking sound fx coming from the Hist tree. This conveys it’s mystery and its otherworldly sentience. **~****Compatibility ~**Compatible with nearly everything. There’s very few overhauls if any that I know of that enhance the Sleeping Tree Camp location. Not compatible of course with other Sleeping Tree model replacers. The Giants camp was not touched at all. No NavMesh edits either. There’s a few patches and optional files that exist for minor adjustments -
  
- LoS II patch (by ToosTruss)
  
- Grandiose Giants patch (by ToosTruus)
  
- Embers XD patch (by ToosTruus)
  
- Traverse the Ulvenwald patch (by clearing)
  
- Dead looking (leafless) tree mesh
  
- Magical Purple Glow Effect tree mesh
  
- Seasonal Patch (by Fallven)
  
- Xelzaz consistency patch
  
  
  
**~ FAQ ~**
  
**ESL flagged? Safe to install mid-game?**
  
Yes.
  
  
**Can I still access the spigot for sap?**
  
Yes, it’s subtly hidden under some hanging moss. 
  
  
**LOD / Dyndolod?**
  
As this is one big unique tree, I currently have Full LOD enabled on the model in the plugin. The mesh is reasonable with its triangle count. Therefore just add to Load Order, no need to rerun Dyndolod. 
  
  
**Skyrim LE version?**
  
If anyone wants to backport this to LE, please go for it. You have my permission.
