If you've ever had the misfortune to look down in Whiterun market, you will have seen this

This is Bethesda's 'tundra scrub'. It is a static object with a pretty terrible texture and mesh.
  
And if you use Seasonal Landscapes, you will have the same eyesore but recolored for each season.
  
ICFur made some lovely tundra scrub replacers with 3 color options (green, orange, red - plus snowy versions), which also move in the wind like other plants.
  
  
Using ICFur's animated tundra scrubs as a base, I made this mod for Seasonal Landscapes with a distinct appearance for each season:
  
  
**Spring**
  
Light green foliage, small flowers (sweet alyssum and forget-me-not)

**Summer**
  
Deeper green foliage, no additional flowers

**Autumn**
  
Orange-brown foliage that blends well with autumn tundra

**Winter**
  
Snowy, desaturated brownish foliage with fewer leaves

Personally, I don't want no scrubs~ visible in winter because I prefer the more bleak and barren appearance. If you also prefer it this way, the winter scrubs can easily be disabled with a quick edit to the text file "Seasonal Animated Spiffed Up Tundra Scrubs\_WIN.ini" found in Seasons folder of this mod - instructions are in the text file.
