[GKB Waves](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19077) is an awesome mod that adds waves to seashore in skyrim. I use this mod to complement [Water for ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37061) mod. It is just unfortunate that this mod does'nt cover all skyrim seashore (only up to solitude)  and the mod itself hasn't updated for almost 4 years. So i decided to make this and share it here.
  
  
I have added waves to almost all skyrim seashore from solitude onward to the east area where i think there should be waves and i have added waves to soltsheim replacing the vanilla wave.
  
i tried to make this as realistic as possible, but you might not find this perfect to represent real waves. Nevertheless this looks quite good at least for me
  
  
**UPDATE 3.1 Smoother transition between waves**
  
  
  
**UPDATE 2.0** Waves with sound to make it 99% more immersive!
