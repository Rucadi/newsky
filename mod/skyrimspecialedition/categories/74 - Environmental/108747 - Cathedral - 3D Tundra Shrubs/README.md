**Description**[/color][/size]
  
All 10 models of the vanilla tundra shrubs, but in 3D. The color, saturation, and brightness have been matched to the vanilla models.  
  
  
**On Performance**
  
The geometry is only 6x more complex than the vanilla models. Performance will not be affected unless you have a mod that adds hundreds to thousands of these plants to a small area.
