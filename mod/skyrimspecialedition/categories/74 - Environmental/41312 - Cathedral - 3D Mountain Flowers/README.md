# Cathedral - 3D Mountain Flowers
- Author: Jonny Wang
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41312
**Description**
  
Replaces the ultra low quality vanilla mountain flowers with 3D flowers created from photographs of columbine flowers characteristic of high altitude and northern latitude flora. Columbines are found in TESIV and ESO, and are therefore lore friendly. 
  
  
**Performance**
  
 The textures are 2k and UV mapped to minimize overdraw; they have better performance than the lower resolution vanilla textures. The models themselves are about 2-3x higher polygon than the vanilla models, but given how extremely low polygon the vanilla models are, they are still relatively low polygon and unlikely to have measurable performance impact.  
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
From version 1.7 and up, this mod uses an ESL to replace mountain flowers in snowy regions with alternate snowy models. Allow other mods to overwrite this ESL. This mod is compatible with Skyrim 3D Plants using the optional compatibility patch, which must overwrite Skyrim 3D Plants. 
  
  
**Permissions**
  
Open permissions so long as you share your mod with open permissions as well.
