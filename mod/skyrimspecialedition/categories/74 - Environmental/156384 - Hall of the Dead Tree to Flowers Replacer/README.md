[font=Tahoma]There are two planters in the Hall of the Dead in Whiterun that have those ugly reach cliff trees in them. It always bothered me, especially when I use a tree replacer that uses much taller trees, such as [Blubbos Reach Tree Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65233), only to walk into the Hall of the Dead and notice that they are sticking through the roof.
  
  
So that's where this mod comes in. It replaces the trees with mountain flowers. Now we can honor the dead with pretty colorful flowers proper like.
  
  
I specifically made this plugin to be used with [Cathedral - 3D Mountain Flowers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41312) as a somewhat soft requirement, as I made scale and positional adjustments to the plugin so they would be seated and aligned more properly to look like they actually belong in the planters to begin with.
  
  
See pictures.
  
  
You can also use [Alternate Cathedral Mountain Flowers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/87951) as well, since it just replaces the textures of Cathedral - 3D Mountain Flowers.
  
  
I made 3 different versions to suit more people.
  
  
Red and Blue together
  
  
Both Blue
  
  
Both Red
  
  
Any other mountain flower replacer mod you use might be problematic and not fit properly, so keep that in mind if you try other options. That includes things like Base Object Swapper inis that affect both Blue and Red Mountain01 flowers.
