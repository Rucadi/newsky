This is a revised standalone version of the original mod [Master the Summit](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4520?tab=description) which I fixed, cleaned ,added several navmeshes ,moved some stuff , added missing paths and small bridges. 
  
  
Nearly every area has incomplete or missing navmeshes, including the grotto, where navmeshes are entirely absent.
  
Few bridges have been expanded or edited from their original placement in the old mod, including those in the grotto.
  
  
This is a standalone version that will completely replace the old mod. The patches included on this page are created using this new standalone version as a master. All other missing patches need to be made using this mod as so*USSEP - **Compatible** - Patch available
