What this mod does:[/font]
  
This mod replaces the vanilla dirt cliff meshes with lush, detailed vines from the High Quality Ivy mod. It brings a more natural, overgrown look to cliff faces across Skyrim SE, enhancing immersion and visual variety. A seasonal support system is also included, allowing vine colors to change with spring, summer, autumn, and winter.
  
  
What exactly does it modify:
  
[\*]Replaces all dirt cliff meshes with custom meshes that integrate High Quality Ivy vines.
  
[\*]Applies vine textures in multiple resolutions to maintain performance on a variety of systems depending on your choice in High Quality Ivy.
  
[\*]Adds seasonal switching script:
  

  
* **Autumn:** Warm orange and red tones
**Winter:** Frost-kissed, sparse vine
