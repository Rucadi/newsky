This little project started with me wanting to add in the [whip-poor-will's song](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/95887) I'd heard in Breath of the Wild. After release, I received some great responses in the comments and - now knowing how to add birds - decided to expand the project in earnest.
  
  
It's all set up exactly the same as the vanilla bird ambience, so the new sounds can be heard at random anywhere in their respective regions, layered with all the other regional sounds.
  
  
This also won't remove or alter any of the existing bird ambience - it just adds more, and thanks to Sound Record Distributor, it is completely conflict-free.
  
  
More to come!

I've grouped the new birds by region below, as well as by the time they're active.
  
  
Each bird's name is a link to where you can learn more about them. Next to the name is a preview to hear a sample of their song.

Flagged as ESL.
  
  
Now that I've got a grasp on how Skyrim's bird ambience works, I'd like to keep expanding this - it's simple enough and makes a big difference in-game.
  
  
Let me know if there's any specific birds you'd like to hear.
  
  
Birds are pretty fascinating, now that I'm really thinking about it.
