**PATCHES AND ADD-ONS**

  
* [PCAviator made an interior add-on for this.  Check it out here!](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27887?tab=files)
[Retrophyx made a patch for Quaint RavenRock so that can be used together with this AND the interior mod above! Get it here!](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/135518)﻿
  

  
**DESCRIPTION**
  
  
**Solstheim Lighthouse** adds a new Redoran style lighthouse with a custom made mesh (with custom collision) to the edge of the Solstheim island, at the inlet of the docks.  I couldn't find an existing resource, so I took a couple hours and whipped this up from scratch.  Don't forget to endorse if you like it!
  
  
I've been peppering some detail into Solstheim to prepare for an upcoming playthrough, and always thought that the island could use a lighthouse.  Solstheim is foggy, and laden with ash, so I can't imagine it's easy to navigate as a sailor coming to port.  Not to mention, its beaches are covered in those basalt columns, which would bash a ship apart with ease.  Sailors, rejoice!
  
  
**CONTENTS**
  
  

  
* **v1.2 Improved mesh with better UV unwrapping (no seams)**
**v1.2 Optional HD Texture for bricks in the optional files**
  
* **v1.2 ESL version**
New lighthouse mesh (with custom collision).  Uses vanilla textures so your Raven Rock / Bulwark textures will be used.
  
* Lighthouse, fire, and glow are flagged as "Is Full LOD" so they will be visible from great distances.
Decorated with fire, lights, banners, a rowboat, and a guard who will stand near the entrance 24/7.
  
* Functioning doors so you can go up to the top of the lighthouse.  This is done with a tiny snip of script that runs when you activate the door to avoid editing navmeshing.  Followers won't follow you but there's no space up there anyway.
2 vanilla edits to simply move an ash pile, and a basalt column out of the way where the lighthouse sits.
  

  
**While you're at it, grab this little Skaal fishing camp I just released as well, featuring a new Skaal tent mesh/textures.**

**F.A.Q.**
  
  
**Q: "Can you make this for Oldrim?"**
  
A: I don't have Oldrim/LE installed anymore but I'll see if I can, time permitting.
  
  
**Q: "Does this conflict with XYZ mod?"**
  
A: Unless something puts stuff exactly where the lighthouse is, then no.  Do let me know though.
  
  
**Q: "Can you add this and that?"**
  
A: Maybe.  This was just a simple little thing that I thought turned out pretty cool and might be useful to other.
  
  
**Q: "Did you know that the length from your wrist to the fold of your elbow is how long your feet are?"**A: Yep!  Pretty weird, man.
  
  
**ENJOY!  HAPPY NEW YEAR!**
