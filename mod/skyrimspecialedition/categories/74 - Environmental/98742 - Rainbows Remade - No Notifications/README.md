Requires [Rainbows Remade](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/88161)﻿!

A simple edit to Rainbows Remade's RBQuest script that simply removes the notifications that appear in the top right telling you that a rainbow is coming - the notifications that read "**The sky clears and the rainbow appears**" and "**The sky clears and the moonbow appears**", in addition to removing the initialization message on game load.
  
  
I simply wanted rainbows to exist in the world without being notified whenever one was occurring.
  
  
No ESP, just a script replacement.

Should be safe to install midgame even if you have Rainbows Remade active already.
  
  
I'd recommend saving indoors while no rainbows are active before installing to be safe - that's what I did.
