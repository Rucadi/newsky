***Overview Moons***
  
These three options effects the sizes of the moons. Works with vanilla moons and all moon texture mods you prefer.
  
You can choose between "Bigger Moons" or "Even Bigger Moons". You can even choose "Smaller Moons".
  
  
- Bigger Moons -
  
Masser and Secunda are 50% larger than Vanilla
  
  
- Even Bigger Moons -
  
Masser and Secunda are 100% larger than Vanilla
  
  
- Smaller Moons -
  
Masser and Secunda are 50% smaller than Vanilla
  
  
***Installation***
  
Mod Organizer 2 highly recommended.
  
Comes with a handy fomod as of 3.1 version.
  
  
***Compatibility***
  
Bigger Moons, Even Bigger Moons and Smaller Moons are compatible with all moon texture mods.
  
I suggest to have [Skygazer Moons SSE - Masser and Secunda HD Textures - WITH GLOW](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32057) installed
  
without glow option. If you install it with glow option it will alter the sizes from my mod.
  
With the latest [ENB Binaries](http://enbdev.com/download.html) installed you shouldn't even need "glow option".
  
Partially compatible with [Moon and Stars - Sky Overhaul SKSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73336) due to this Q/A below from said mod.﻿

***Overview Original Glowing Moons from Isoku***

Masser and Secunda now glow. The fuller the moon, the brighter the glow. Glow is more apparent behind clouds and/or near the horizon.
  
This is a script-free mod that works by expanding the texture dimensions of the moons to make room for a glow overlay. Normally this would result in smaller moons, but the esp file is used to restore the moons back to their original sizes.
