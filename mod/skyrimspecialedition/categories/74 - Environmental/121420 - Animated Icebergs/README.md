[font=Comic Sans MS]***[b]Icebergs are gently bobbing now. Using assets from*** [Isoku's](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/2463371) [Realistic Water Two](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/41076)**Legendary Edition.**
  
**Ofcourse, i have permission to use them. But credits to him for making these assets a long time ago.**

**Plugin is esl flagged and does not require Realistic Water to work.** 
  
**Mod is standalone and compatible with everything.**
  
**The mod only edits the icebergsmall01.nif and icebergsmall02.nif
  
and only the ice bergs that are floating in the sea.**
  
**The icebergs attached to land or any other static objects will not bob for obvious reasons.**
  
**Meshes will use the textures from ice mods you use. Addons available in fomod.**
  
**Mod also comes with it's own "cracking" sound FX and volume slider for it can be found in "settings" menu.**
  
  
**Now as optional, you can install "Animated Icebergs - Large Icebergs". Only logical selected large bergs are gently bobbing with this optional. For this, a new mesh had to be created.**
