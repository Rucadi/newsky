I've gone through all the grass texture files in [Cathedral Landscapes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21954) and [Cathedral - 3D Pine Grass](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42032), darkening and desaturating the files.
  
I have also included [wSkeever's Mipmap Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62477)
  
  
I have merged the Cathedral Landscapes grass-only plugin with the 3D Pine Grass plugin, fixed some water seams and cleaned in xEdit. So, this is a standalone grass mod.
  
  
I am including retexture-only files without an esp which can be used to overwrite the above two mods (in case you are using the full version of Cathedral Landscapes).
  
  
Now including an optional ini file, which you can delete if you don't like. It has these settings:
  
[Grass]
  
bAllowCreateGrass=1
  
bAllowLoadGrass=0
  
fGrassMaxStartFadeDistance=20000.0000
  
fGrassMinStartFadeDistance=0.0000
  
fGrassFadeRange=20000.0000
  
iMaxGrassTypesPerTexure=15
  
iMinGrassSize=60

We know from experience that modding is an extremely addictive past-time and can be a slippery slope from creating a simple load order to porting mods to going full boat and attempting to rebuild Skyrim from the ground up. That's why we believe in a community that integrates Xbox and PC gamers along with porting noobs and experienced mod authors. We all have more to learn, and modding Skyrim to its extreme is a community effort to say the least.
