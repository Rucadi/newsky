# Remove Hanging Moss From Trees

If you use a replacer that significantly changes the shape or size of the trees in the Reach or run a mod that removes all the Reach trees you may find a lot of Hanging Moss floating in mid-air. This mod removes that moss. All other moss in the game is left untouched.
  
  
  
HOW WAS IT ACHIEVED?
  
[EdmondNoir](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/36563980) made [this](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42649) mod. All I did was change each Hanging Moss record in his mod to Initially Disabled. This process took me 2 minutes. To create the original mod must have taken Edmond ages so click on his profile and give him a kudo and thank him for his hard work in the comments section.
  
Note: I've decided to give 100% of DP to Edmond for all his hard work on the original mod.
  
  
I USE SIMPLY BIGGER TREES - SHOULD I USE THIS MOD?
  
You may as well use the original mod linked above which repositions Hanging Moss to make it compatible with SBT. 
  
  
ESL?
  
Yep
  
  
HEY I FOUND SOME FLOATING MOSS!
  
If you have [More Informative Console](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19250) installed (you really should), open the console, click the moss and check the Ref Defined In. If it's in the base game (Skyrim, Update, Dawnguard, Dragonborn or Hearthfire), post the Ref Form ID in the comments and I will add it to the plugin.
  
  
  
BONE ALARM DISABLER
  
User Laromyr pointed out 3 Forsworn Bone Alarms that hang from Reach trees. These attach to the trees in a different place to the moss so they may (or may not) be floating for you depending on which tree replacer you are using. Because of this (and to avoid feature creep) I have created a second Optional plugin to disable these items. The plugin is ESL flagged ESP so won't take up a slot in your load order
  
  
Updated to version 1.1 - disabled a few more floating items (no longer just bone alarms)
