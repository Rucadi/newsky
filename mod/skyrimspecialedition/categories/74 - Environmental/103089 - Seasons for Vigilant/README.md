No, this mod does not bring seasons to Oblivion. But it *does* bring seasons to all Tamrielic locations added by Vigilant, where I also have made sure to make them work seamlessly with all Seasons mods out there, and even one mod that has not been published yet. This mod also serves as a showcase for things I am currently working with. I have planned for quite a while to add seasons to a bunch of mods which add new worlds to the game, while also aiming for a high quality and compatibility with other mods. Unfortunately, work has been held back a bit while trying to finish a big mod I am working with, but with the sudden interest in adding seasons to new worldspaces, I thought it was time to share some of my work. Here it is condensed into the rather limited areas covered by Vigilant.
  
  
**Features:**

  
* Seasons added to Stuhn Ravine, Witch's Pond, and Bruiant Estate.
Several landscape fixes to make the locations look natural with Seasons and fully compatible with [Seasonal Landscapes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66903).
  
* A blacklist removing snow from sheltered objects.
Seasonal variations of one mod-added plant.
  
* A patch for [Seasonal Landscapes - Unfrozen](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71967).
An option to add ice to the waterways in Vigilant's worlds. Requires [Turn of the Seasons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63623).
  
* A seasonal [Simplicity of Snow](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56235) patch.

  
**Details:***Landscape fixes:*

  
* Enabled grass in all Tamrielic worldspaces added by Vigilant, since this looks way more natural with mods such as Seasonal Landscapes and Seasonal Landscapes - Unfrozen.
Cleared grass from some of Vigilant's locations (both from the above worldspaces and Vanilla areas) for compatibility with Seasonal Landscapes and any other grass mods (inspired by, and recommended to use with [Landscape Fixes For Grass Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9005)).
  

  
* Cleared snow from sheltered and below-water surface areas during winter, by using dedicated texture assets, or appropriate ones for submerged areas.
A Seasonal Landscapes patch is included to make the new texture sets swap consistently with that mod.
  

  
*The blacklist:*A drawback with Seasons of Skyrim is that it adds snow to essentially every object in affected worldspaces, unless instructed to ignore certain objects. Clearly, e.g. sheltered and below-water objects should not be covered in snow. To prevent this, I have included a blacklist for such objects in both the new worldspaces and Stendarr's Beacon. However, some objects on the list are likely to still remain snowy, due to the way Seasons work (objects included in the autogenerated form swap file are not affected by the blacklist). I have developed a framework to circumvent this, but I think the scope of this mod is too small to warrant me to publish it right now. When I have completed my blacklist for all Vanilla locations, I will publish the framework, so stay tuned.
  
  
There are however a couple of objects on the blacklist that will (intentionally) not be fixed by the framework. For those I have included a SWAP file that uses Base Object Swapper to remove the snow.
  
  
I have not included assets contained in the blacklist at [Seasonal Landscape Additions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90846), so make sure to get that mod too. At least for the blacklist, but I recommend getting the other features as well.
  
  
*Unfrozen patch*:
  

  
* Swaps all snowy objects added by Vigilant with non-snowy variants during summer.
Clears grass from areas that should not have it, both in Stuhn Ravine, outside its entrance, and at Stendarr's Beacon (missed by the main Unfrozen mod).
  
* Adds a path to Stuhn ravine from the closest main road in the Vanilla worldspace (required IMO with all the grass in summer).
Patches for Helarchen Creek (redirects the above path) and Stendarr Replacer (makes the Unfrozen patch use the correct model) are included.
  

  
*Simplicity of Snow patch:*This is inspired by [Simplicity of Seasons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76645), a mod I unfortunately cannot recommend at this point due to its insane number of bugs (you have been warned). The patch contains several assets that have been partially cleared of snow in winter, due to them being sheltered etc. It also contains replacers for some of the regular meshes at the Temple of Stendarr. While recommended to use with Simplicity of Snow, it might work also with some other snow shaders, but don't turn to me if you run into issues.
  
  
Also included are a few object replacements, where snow has been cleared through Base Object Swapper for better blending with the new meshes.
  
  
The meshes included are mostly modified assets from Simplicity of Seasons, where I have fixed their issues. I have also included a few assets not covered by that mod. My goal is to fix all issues with Simplicity of Seasons that I find, expand on the work to cover all Vanilla areas, and add compability patches for a large number of mods (the mod author is aware of it). This is the project that has held me back, but since I have gotten quite far, I was able to include several of the assets I have worked with here (the assets provided are all Vanilla-based). A consequence is that several of the replacers will show up in Vanilla locations as well (mostly in Solitude). As such, I consider the patch included here a patch for my successor to Simplicity of Seasons, rather than to Simplicity of Seasons itself.
  
  
*The rest:*Two custom meshes are included in the main install:
  

  
* A new model for the Temple entrance, which has been cleared of ivy (it is located in one of the coldest regions of Skyrim after all). Compatible with Simplicity of Snow.
A seasonal kelp variant, since this water asset was placed on land at Bruaint Estate (I think it looks fine, just find it an odd choice). A patch for Mari's Flora is also included.
  

  
**DynDOLOD notice:**All Vigilant's worldspaces have been excluded by DynDOLOD by default, so if you want to generate seasonal lod, you need to edit the file *Edit Scripts/DynDOLOD/Configs/DynDOLOD\_SSE\_worldspace\_ignore.txt*, and either remove or comment out zAoMVigilantWorld, zAoMWitchWorld, and zCOBruiantWorld[color=#ffffff]. As far as I understand, Vigilant's worldspaces have been disabled since some assets or IDs were not following Bethesda's naming conventions, which has caused issues for some players. That said, I was not experiencing any problems at all generating LOD files for these worldspaces. I would rather suspect the issues are with the Coldharbour worldspaces, since these contain a lot of custom assets. But if you don't want to risk it, the worldsapaces affected by this mod are small, and you might[/color] do fine without seasonal LOD.
  
  
However, it would be good for me to know if people are experiencing problems with LOD generation that can be tracked to the worldspaces involved here, so feel free to tell me if you do (but rule out any other causes before reporting, please). If you try generate LOD for Vigilant's other worldspaces, you are on your own, though, and I will not help you with any issues you might face.
  
  
**Load order:**Make sure that assets from this mod win all conflicts (except possibly the one listed in the compatibility section). A modgroups file has been included to assist with the load order, but also make sure to follow the following rules:

  
* Seasons\_Vigilant.esp must load **after any mod** not included at this page that adds references to zAoMVigilantWorld or zAoMWitchWorld, including StendarrReplacer.esp and Lux - Vigilant patch.esp[color=#ffffff].[/color]
Seasons\_Vigilant.esp should load **after** Landscape Fixes For Grass Mods.esp (its fixes are included in this mod).
  
* Seasonal Landscapes - Unfrozen - Heljarchen Creek Patch.esp and [color=#ffffff][color=#ffd966]Seasonal Landscapes - Unfrozen - Ivy's Stendarr's Beacon patch.esp[/color][/color] must load **after** Seasonal Landscapes - Unfrozen - Vigilant.esp[color=#ffffff].[/color]
Seasons\_Vigilant - Ryn's Alchemists Shack patch.esp must load **after** Ryn's Alchemists Shack - LFfGM patch.esp and Ryn's Alchemist's Shack - Landscape Fixes for Grass Mods.esp, and should **not** be used together with Ryn's Alchemists Shack - LAWF patch.esp[color=#ffffff].[/color]
  

  
**Compatibility:**I have tried to make this as compatible as possible with other mods without sacrificing mod quality, and provided patches for any mod I have found conflicts with. However, since I have made extensive landscape edits, conflicts are likely to arise with other mods affecting the same areas. There are still a few conflicts I am aware of that I have not yet fixed:
  
  

  
* Mesh conflict with Drengin's Blue Palace - Mesh Only Replacer and any other mod using replacers for sbluepalace.nif. I am not planning to create a patch for it. The original Drengin's Blue Palace mod is using a custom name for the mesh, so it does not have that conflict.
Conflict with Xtudo's Temple of Stendarr's music replacement mod. That mod also edits the Worldspace data in Stuhn Ravine, and thus needs a patch. There is no way I am going to use a mod myself that adds Witcher tracks to Skyrim, but if there is a demand for it I might create a patch or ask Xtudo for it.
  
* Similarly to AgentW's Stendarr Replacer, Xtudo's Stendarr statue replacer would also need a patch for Unfrozen. Otherwise, you will get the Vanilla model during summer. Personally, I prefer AgentW's version, but if someone wants a patch for Xtudo's replacer, I might provide one (or ask Xtudo).
Not compatible with **Seasons of Vigilant**. That is another mod aiming at doing the same thing, but it does not contain all features covered by this mod (nor do I think he has resolved all issues that I have addressed). It might be better for compatibility with some mods not covered by my patches, but I think the difference is minor. On top of this, it adds Seasons to some of the Oblivion worldspaces, likely by accident.
