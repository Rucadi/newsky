Now with [Splashes of Storms](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72115) the splashes of rain from [Wonders of Weather](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13044) are replaced by it.
  
But still we need Shooting Stars in our games. At least i do. So i made a direct port of this wonderfull mod from Isoku, [Shooting Stars](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25022)
  
Ofcourse i have full permission to do so.

Shooting stars aka fragments of Aetherius appear in various sizes and fall from various positions in the sky at night (8:30pm to 6:00am). The general direction they fall in will change on a monthly basis.
  
Meteor showers (shooting star frequency increased) are guaranteed to occur during certain nights of the year. The dates they occur on coincide with the actual meteor shower dates of Earth.
  
  
3rd of Morning Star
  
21st of Rain's Hand
  
5th of Second Seed
  
11th of Last Seed
  
20th of Frostfall
  
17th of Sun's Dusk
  
13th of Evening Star
  
  
Meteor storms (shooting star frequency greatly increased) have an extremely low chance of occurring each night.
  
You may see them 2-3 times per in-game year.
