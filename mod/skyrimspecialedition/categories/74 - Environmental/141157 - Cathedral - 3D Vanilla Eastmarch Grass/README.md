-Crafted from the vanilla grass textures.
  
-Efficient 3D grass models.
  
-BC3 optimized textures to improve BSA efficiency, yielding a 5.7 MB file size.
  
-Does not touch \_nograss landscape records, so if you are using other grass mods, you will probably get a blend of both.
  
-Recommended imingrasssize of 50, though there should not be issues with tiling at lower densities (ie imingrasssize of 60).
