Changes ivy to being dead (or removes it entirely) in winter, for Seasons of Skyrim/Seasonal Landscapes/Unfrozen users.
  
  
It always bothered me running around in the winter months while using Seasons of Skyrim, but yet still seeing green (albeit covered in snow) ivy. The walls, the stone piles, and also the stuff growing on the fallen logs. So, I decided to do something about it.
  
  
This mod's installer has a few options to deal with ivy in the winter:
  
A.) Swap the ivy for dead vines and remove ivy that is on fallen trees/stumps (doesn't look very good but hey, it's something).
  
B.) Remove the ivy entirely and remove ivy that is on fallen trees/stumps.
  
C.) Swap the ivy for dead vines, but don't swap the stumps/fallen trees.
  
D.) Remove the ivy entirely, but don't swap the stumps/fallen trees.
  
  
This is all in the FOMOD in the main download, as an **ESL-Flagged ESP**.
  
  
AFAIK I got all the stuff that has ivy on it (maybe?), but if there's any vanilla meshes with ivy I missed let me know. I don't have any intention of patching various mods as they usually require me to fix meshes, and I cannot upload meshes from most other people's mods.
  
  
**Compatibility:**
  
I am replacing these meshes when using full version & **ONLY IN WINTER**: Ivy01, Ivy02, Ivy03, Stonewall01ivy, Stonewallendl01ivy, Stonewallendr01ivy, treepineforeststump02a, and treepineforeststump02b. The rest of the tree stump/log swaps are just changing out whatever vanilla model for a different vanilla model. This can all be seen in the seasons file included in the mod. If you are overriding those vanilla meshes, then they will get swapped with your overrides. The only texture that is being changed is the one for the dead ivy, and once again, only in the winter. No other texture paths have been altered.
  
  
Any other mods that add ivy will not be touched by this mod unless they are using the vanilla forms. If they have their own ivy, this mod won't be swapping it. That said, most do use the vanilla ones from what I have seen.
  
  
It's possible that this mod could conflict with another seasonal mod that changes out ivy in winter, but if you had that why would you download this?
  
  
**Requirements/Load Order:**
  
For older versions of Skyrim (anything before 1.6.1130): [Backported Extended ESL Support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441)
  
Outside of that, nothing & it shouldn't matter.
  
Without Seasons of Skyrim it will do nothing (obviously). Technically though it has no (modded) masters, and the load order shouldn't matter either as it only uses new forms.
