Ever wondered why all those barrels and crates in Raven Rock were completely clean in an ash-filled landscape?
  
What about those abandoned, half-destroyed farms? Telvanni towers?
  
No? Well, I did. And I did something about it.

QUESTIONS + TROUBLESHOOTING
  
  
***You missed something!***Please take a screenshot, or use More Informative Console and give me the RefID of the object, so I can take a look!
  
  
***You missed a LOT of somethings ...***This mod relies heavily on Location data, in some cases provided by USSEP. Please make sure location data (in particular around Raven Rock) is not being overwritten.
  
  
***Is it safe to update from Version 1.0?***
  
Most likely. As this mod uses Base Object Swapper to execute its changes, those changes are executed on game load and are not baked into your save files. Consequently, despite compacting the records for version 2.0, starting a new game shouldn't be necessary under normal circumstances. If you happen to have any third-party patches which edit the Material or Static records added in *Ashbound Revisited.esp*, however, those will require updating.
  
  
***Is it safe to update from Ashbound -- Solstheim Enhanced?***
  
I do not support updating from the old mod (Ashbound -- Solstheim Enhanced) mid-game, as you'd be ripping out a bunch of worldspace edits. Do so at your own risk. 
  
  
***What textures/ENB are used in the screenshots?***
  
[E.V.C. ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71743)[Ancient Pottery](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24039)
  
[Rally's Solstheim AiO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36893)
  
**Telvanni Reborn** for Tel Mithryn
  
[Y.A.L.O.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1839) for landscapes
  
  
  
  
KNOWN ISSUES/LIMITATIONS
  
  

  
* Some of the lootable urns were replaced with static versions (containers can't have ash applied to them). I gave them varying amounts of coverage so the ones I left lootable should still blend in well.
The mushroom trees can't be ashified. -quiet sobbing-
  

  
  
  
CREDITS
  
[AndrealphusVIII](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5646623)﻿ for reminding me there was a lot I didn't cover in the original Ashbound. While I did not directly incorporate their mod to ashify Imperial forts etc., I definitely referenced it for places I should check out!
