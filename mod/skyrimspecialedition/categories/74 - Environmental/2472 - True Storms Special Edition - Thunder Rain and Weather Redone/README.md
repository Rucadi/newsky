One of the top 10 mods of 2015 for Skyrim, and a top 5 mod of all-time for Fallout 4, with over 1 million downloads comes to Skyrim Special Edition!
  
  
**True Storms: Special Edition** is a complete overhaul of the storm systems in Skyrim SE/AE, including new heavy, light, and unique weathers, loads of new intense sound effects, interior sounds, particle effects, new rain, snow, and dust textures, heavy fogs and wind effects, new weathers for Solstheim including dust storms, and **much more!** Simple at its core, True Storms has a **BIG** impact on the atmosphere of Skyrim.  Retains vanilla style, but makes things much more dramatic and varied.
  
  
**True Storms Special Edition has been re-built for Skyrim SE / AE, and includes many new features over its original Skyrim Classic counterpart!**

**FEATURES**
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/9RU4wMB.gif)• HIGH PERFORMANCE. I re-made all fogs and other visual effects and have literally zero impact on my system.
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/9RU4wMB.gif)• Focused on vanilla look and feel, with more intensity, and variation. Great for lore-friendly, immersive gameplay.
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/9RU4wMB.gif)• Retains all of Bethesda's newly re-designed colors, volumetric lighting / god rays, etc.
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/9RU4wMB.gif)• 25+ all-new carefully crafted high quality sound effects for thunder, rain, wind, and interior sounds.
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/9RU4wMB.gif)• Heavy and light variants of each storm type - heavy rain storms and heavy blizzards are contrasted by light, pleasant variants.
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/9RU4wMB.gif)• Interior sound playback - listen to rain on the rooftops as you cozy up in your Hearthfire home.
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/9RU4wMB.gif)• Brand-new rain and snow textures / heavy particle shaders.
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/9RU4wMB.gif)• Heavy mist / rolling fog weathers and wind effects with no performance loss!
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/9RU4wMB.gif)• Lightly adjusted regions to include more diverse weather - experience rainfall on the coast, light snow in Whiterun.
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/9RU4wMB.gif)• Several brand-new weathers for Solstheim! Heavy dust storms, burning ash fall, rain, and harbor fogs.
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/9RU4wMB.gif)• Volume sliders in game audio settings to idependently control volume for thunder, rain, and interior sounds.
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/9RU4wMB.gif)• Solves an issue in vanilla where a single thunder sound is chosen during a storm and played repeatedly - now it’s properly random!
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/9RU4wMB.gif)• Sneak buffs during heavy storms for you and companions is in progress and coming in an update!

**INSTALLATION & LOAD ORDER**
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/9RU4wMB.gif)• Install and go! Use NMM or manual (drag-and-drop files from into /data/ folder, and add TrueStormsSE.esp in plugins.txt)
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/9RU4wMB.gif)• Everything is packed into BSA files for cleanliness and ease of installation.
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/9RU4wMB.gif)• Load order shouldn't really matter. Weather mods will overwrite each other without specific patches, so you should only use one at a time. There isn't much that will conflict at the moment, but I would put it after Wet and Cold if you're using that. More as this develops!

**COMPATIBILITY
  
  
[b]There are a multitude of patches available for nearly all of the popular weather mods, thanks to the wonderful community.  A search for "True Storms" here on Nexus will yield many results.**[/b]
  
  
• Darker Nights (100% compatible!  Patch part of Darker Nights v1.4!)
  
• Frostfall (100% compatible)
  
• Wet and Cold (90% compatible) -- we both add Solstheim weathers, so whatever loads last will 'win' til a patch is made but will work fine otherwise
  
• ELFX (90% compatible) -- ELFX mostly edits interiors, but if you're using ELFX Exteriors or Weathers, just load True Storms after in your load order
  
• Realistic Lighting Overhaul (90%) -- Interiors are fully compatible, but not the RLO weathers.  If you load True Storms after RLO you will get RLO's interiors, and my storms.
