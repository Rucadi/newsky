The Soul Cairn is a barren and exposed place...this mod changes that.  Dilon Reyth (Dovahzul for Death Trees) adds new spooky trees throughout the Soul Cairn and transforms it into a gnarled forest of spidery giants.

Their are three versions to choose from varying from tall, medium and small.  The tall trees are truly massive and tower overhead. Where their numbers increase, the forest can get kinda claustrophobic, nice!  The smaller version are more like IRL sized trees and still allows you great views across the crater, whilst the medium version is somewhere in between.
  
  
Dilon Reyth also contains optimized ultralods for DynDOLOD and the Dilon Reyth plugin is a light master (ESL ESM)

Install normally with a mod manager. Dilon Reyth does not contain any scripts, and is safe to install/unistall at any time.
  
  
From the main files in the downloads, choose only one file, either tall, medium or small.
  
  
To get the new tree ultralods, you will need to run DynDOLOD - make sure to select Tree Ultralod and include worldspace DLC01SoulCairn and DLC01Boneyard during DynDOLOD generation.
