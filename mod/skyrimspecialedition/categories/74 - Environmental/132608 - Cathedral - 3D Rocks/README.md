# Cathedral - 3D Rocks
- Author: DrJacopo

Description
  
Adds 3D boulders, stones, and pebbles to landscape that Bethesda intended to be rocky. This mod was inspired by high altitude environments while preserving the original art direction of the game.
  
  
  
Performance
  
The models are highly optimized, with vertex counts between 20 to 36 per stone. That said, this mod adds so much geometry to the terrain that there will be a measurable performance impact. On my 1660 Ti laptop, the performance cost is about 5 fps with CS, default density, and imingrasssize of 50. On my RTX 4090, there was no measurable performance impact. 
  
  
  
Compatibility
  
This mod is compatible with all grass mods. There may be harmless conflicts. If you wish for the changes from this mod to dominate, then overwrite your grass mods with this file.
  
  
If you wish to use this mod with my latest stand-alone grass mod, [*Cathedral - 3D Landscapes*](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80687), then you will still need the *"3D Grass Library - Meshes*" file from that page (until 3D-Landscapes receives it next update, at which point the rock meshes will be incorporated).

Troubleshooting
  
If the 3D rocks are not appearing, then please check that you have the required meshes from the Grass Library. If you use NGIO (No Grass in Objects) with grass cache, you will need to regenerate your grass cache.
