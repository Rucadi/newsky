I always loved Morthal but i dislike the snow added to Morthal. I like to see Morthal as a foggy, non snowy town. So i removed the snow from Morthal town. Only part i left alone is the burned building cause i think there the snow from No Snow Under the Roof fits very well. This mod also removes vanilla snow and reverts all walkways and other objects to not snowy. I think it is more fitting cause Morthal is next to a swamp.
