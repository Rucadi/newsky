***[font=Comic Sans MS]This mod is a reworked version of [Foggy Morthal and Swamp](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23571) and created from scratch.
  
  
I like the town Morthal very much for my own personal playthrough. But i do like to see it more like a Silent Hill kind of village. That is why i also created the mod [No Morthal Snow - Redone.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/95749) Ofcourse you don't need that mod along with this mod. But all pics are made with both installed.

So, what does this mod do?
  
It enhances the foggy weather in Morthal region including swamps and makes it always foggy. Also there will be no music playing in this region like at all.
  
This will give you Silent Hill feel when you are in the swamps of Hjaalmarch.
  
[/font]******[font=Comic Sans MS]That's it!
  
  
[/font]****[font=Comic Sans MS]**To have this mod even creepier than it already is i've made "SFfMR - The Sounds of Dawn Addon". This addon uses sounds of the mod The Sounds of Dawn from**[Clofas1](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/89830933?tab=user+files)**. Unfortunately not (yet) available on Nexus. Hope to see it on Nexus someday. The addon itself adds creepy critter, animal, distantFX, etc, etc that totally fits the vibe of Supreme Fog for Morthal Region and most can be heard deep in the night when all else is dead silent. But in a realistic way.**
  
  
**(This addon is incorporated as of version 1.5 of main mod)**
  
  
**Now as of version 1.5 completely independent from any weather mod. Place my mod and patches after any weather mod you use. Mod is still based on Obsidian weather but it does not require it. Hence the ENB ini fle. Plugin is esl flagged and comes with an YAML file.**

**- Main File**
  
**- Main File with Music**
  
**- Patch for Mists of Tamriel**
  
  
**Compatible with**[Sound Record Distributor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77815) **and** [Regional Sounds Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77829)**.**
  
  
**INSTALLATION:**
  
**Use prefered mod manager and activate the mod. Place plugin and patches after any weather mod of use.**
  
  
  
**ENJOY!!**[/font]*
  
  
***[font=Comic Sans MS]Highly recommended to use along side my mod would be [M.O.I.S.T. - Massive Outstandingly Insane Swamp Tree](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99083) from [AlaxoucheModding](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/57127132).
  
The trees from that mod fits perfectly and completes of how i see Morthal as a complete unigue scary region.[/font]***
