**Fabled Forests - Exclude Morthal Marsh**
  
  

Fabled Forests - Exclude Morthal Marsh is a simple patch for [Fabled Forests](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/94462) to disable all changes to the Morthal Swamps area and all cells modified by [Enhanced Landscapes - Dead Marsh Standalone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85480). ﻿The "Exclude Morthal" patch provided in the Fabled Forests fomod only disables the trees added within the city limits. The "'Exclude Morthal Marsh" patch disables all changes made by Fabled Forests to the entirely of the Morthal swamp area, improving compatibility with mods that overhaul the same region.

A version for users who do not use EL - Dead Marsh and want to disable ALL changes made by Fabled Forests to the marsh area is also provided. Note that this patch re-enables vanilla Reach Trees that were disabled by Fabled Forests. An optional *additional* patch is provided to revert these Reach Trees to their vanilla position and scale to play nice with mods that swap those trees with new models, such as [Massive Outstandingly Insane Swamp Tree](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99083).

All plugins are **ESL-flagged** so they won’t count toward your ESP limit.
  
  
**Load Order**
  
  

In order for your game to look like the screenshots, you will need to download Enhanced Landscapes - Dead Marsh Standalone separately and load it after this patch. Be sure to add a LOOT rule for all patches to load AFTER Fabled Forests and BEFORE Dead Marsh.

If you are using the Dead Marsh - Handplaced MOIST Trees file, you do NOT need the Revert Reach Trees optional. There is no dependency on Dead Marsh for this file, but no promises the trees will not clip with other assets if you're not using it.

**Recommendations**
  
  

* The Morthal Marsh module from [Ambient Clouds](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86848).
[Animated Small Blackreach Mushrooms](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86128) includes higher-poly assets plus added collision. You can delete everything except for mushroom04.nif and mushroom03.nif if you don't want the additional features.﻿ I've provided a high-poly version of the mushrooms without animations as an optional file.
  
* Any of the [Detailed Landscapes - Morthal Swamps](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93198)﻿﻿ BOS-based mods. I recommend changing the swap chance to something less than 100%.
You might want to check out [Morthal Barrow](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90737) if you're interested in new points of interest for the Morthal area plus a fun new quest.
  
* You might also want to check out [Unique Marsh Trees](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54479)﻿﻿ which makes the Reach trees in the marsh use unique models.
[Massive Outstandingly Insane Swamp Tree](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99083) adds some unique trees to the Morthal wilderness using Base Object Swapper.﻿
