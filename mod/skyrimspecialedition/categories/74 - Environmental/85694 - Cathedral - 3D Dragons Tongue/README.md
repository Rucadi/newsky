A performance friendly 3D replacer of the horrendous dragons tongue plant. This model is based on a combination of real world plants that resemble the vanilla dragons tongue. This model has over 3x as many flowers as vanilla model and only consists of 800 triangles (vanilla uses ~500). It also significantly reduces overdraw compared to the vanilla model thereby improving performance.
