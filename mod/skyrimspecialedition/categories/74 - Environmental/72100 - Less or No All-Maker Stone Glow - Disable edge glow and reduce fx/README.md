*I like my Skyrim fairly down to earth. Realistic and bleak. Not too much flashy magic and fx in peoples daily life. It's not that I want NO magic, but I want it to be something extraordinary when it shows up. I want wizards to essentially have super powers and I want their abilities to inspire awe. Anyway, for that reason I don't want a super flashy glaringly glowing stone just next to town, so I decided to do something about.***Description:**
  
This mod completely removes the edge glow on All-Maker stones. I don't know why, but [Glow Be Gone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34148?tab=description) doesn't fix the edge glow on All-Maker stones. Until it does, if ever, I had to fix it myself. The mod comes in three versions:

  
* **A.** Disables edge glow and reduces the other effects but keeps them in game. Essentially it removes the magic swirls and the floating stone ring, while keep the pillar of light, at slightly reduced power.
**B.** Disables edge glow AND REMOVES all the magic effects, making the standing-stones just that - regular old standing stones (on the surface, anyway). 
  
* **C.** Disables edge glow only - keeping vanilla swirls and pillar of light

  
  
**Installation & Load Order:**
  
Pick one version, A, B or C, not both!
  

  
* **A.** I would keep this low/late in the load order as it doesn't touch any world records but changes a mesh.
**B.** Load this early/high as it changes world objects (disabling the control ring) and thus also messes with the world space record and such. This version contains no meshes, so there's little risk of it being overwritten.
  
* **C.** Keep it low as it only modified the edge glow effect.

  
  
**Disclaimer:**
  
A fair bit of warning is necessary. As usual, I don't know what I'm doing - despite a decade of modding. Who know's what I've broken? That's the charm of modding I guess, add one thing - break two other. Add to this the fact that I've never ever played Dragonborn, so I have no idea if the effects are important or modified by the game in ways that could cause bugs. However, the way this is implemented, with no deletes and only disables or changed effects/meshes, I *hope* that it should work fine even if a script tries to change effect colors, for example. Please let me know if there's anything I should be aware of ;)
