Hand placed logs, trees and the occasional crate, sunken boat etc amongst the rapids and waterfalls of Skyrim's rivers. I primarily focused on the regions west of Falkreath as they are more heavily forested, but there also placed objects on the river eat of windhelm and in the Reach/solitude areas. 
  
  
This should autosort near the top of your load order, if not make sure it's close to the top of the order, before any water mods so that their changes can copy over my mod. There should be no conflicts this way, I tested in my own list of 1100+ mods using water for enb and had no issues.
  
  
Vanilla objects were used, so any mesh or texture replaces will apply to this mod as well.
