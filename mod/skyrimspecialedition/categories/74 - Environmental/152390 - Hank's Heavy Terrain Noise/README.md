# Hank's Heavy Terrain Noise

**A custom noise texture to replace the vanilla one. This mod is less subtle than vanilla and many of the other terrain noise textures available on Nexus.** 
  
  
This mod helps to make smooth looking landscape LOD areas less distracting, especially in grassy areas.**It is best to use this mod if you are not using grass LODs.
  
  
  
  

There are two versions; V2 is more subtle than the original.
  
The grass will look slightly better with the original and the snow will look slightly better with V2 - the difference is subtle.**
  
  
**Recommended for use with VR**. I have not tested this on flat-screen version. This mod works best on medium to low grass densities, or anything a bit patchy. It does not affect landscape or grass colour.
  
  
  
All CC very welcome - this is my first mod! :)
  
  
  
  
**A NOTE ON SNOW:**
  
  
This effect IS visible in **some** areas in the snow. However, I have done a fair bit of manual editing to mitigate most of the distraction caused by this. As a result, snow looks a little more textured in places, but still looks like snow, and LOD to texture changes are still subtle.
  
  
This mod is not designed to give a perfect result. Instead, it's about achieving a balance which I feel leads to the least amount of immersion breaking distractions over all, and drawing the eye as seldom as possible. 
  
  
There will still be odd LOD changes, delayed grass draws, etc that will make this mod far more apparent, but I have judged these annoyances to be far fewer in total and far less of an issue than perfectly smooth, featureless and grassless terrain LOD.
  
  
  
  
**Install** after any other terrain noise mods. You can install this mod at any time.
  
  
**Uninstall** is safe at any time
