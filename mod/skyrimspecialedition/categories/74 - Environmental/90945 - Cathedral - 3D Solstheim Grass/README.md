This is a 3D Grass overhaul of the Dragonborn DLC, Solstheim. The grasses are predominantly made from photos I took of Iceland's most common grasses. There are also ash covered forest plants found in the inner Solstheim forest. This mod does not affect the northern coast grasses which recycle grass types found from the mainland (ie snow grass, coastal grass, and volcanic tundra grass).
