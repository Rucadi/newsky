Description
  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  
  
 Sharp, ominous, and atmospheric. Obsidian Weathers and Seasons accentuates proximal detail while obscuring distant landscapes in mysterious rolling fogs and atmospheric scattering. Obsidian is a collaborative work; a hybridization of artistic styles that glorifies Skyrim for her beauty while preserving her dated modesty.

Seasons and Filter Options
  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  
  
Implements season based changes in lighting and climate. Naturally progress through the winter, spring, summer, and autumn. Experience torrential downpours in the month of Rain's Hand, the colorful days and nights of Sun's Height, and the ominous autumn cold of Frostfall. Requires the player to sleep in order for changes to take effect. Use the Obsidian power in order to enable Seasons FX or other image filters (fantasy, cold, bleak, and natural) or if you dislike the strong sunlight, enable Weaker Sunlight for a softer look.

Compatibility
  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

  
  

  
* Compatible with everything except weather mods
Not compatible with mods that make nights darker unless they're made specifically for Obsidian Weathers (these are fundamentally weather mods)
  
* Not compatible with storm mods without a patch (these are weather mods)
Uses only vanilla weather ID's ensuring full compatibility with mods like Frostfall, Wet and Cold, Wonders of Weather, and Beyond Skyrim
  
* Seasonal weathers require modification to region records and thus requires a patch for audio overhauls that add new region sounds
Compatible with all interior lighting overhauls (ie, ELE, RS, ELFX, RLO). Minor adjustments made to torches and magelight to balance darker nights.
