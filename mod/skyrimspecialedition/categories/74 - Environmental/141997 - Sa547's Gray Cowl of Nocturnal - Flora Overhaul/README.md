\* DESCRIPTION \*

This is the updated version of [sa547's Flora Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10141) mod. I had permissions to upload.
  
Requires [The Gray Cowl of Nocturnal - 10th anniversary](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/141327) mod.
  
The main difference with the old one is the Dead Forest and Doomed Camp does no longer exists because of the new player home I added in the 10th anniversary version. Also I added few new plants.
