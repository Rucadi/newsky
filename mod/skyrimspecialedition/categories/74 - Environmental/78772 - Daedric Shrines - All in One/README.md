**That's it fellow daedra worshipers, all 16 daercic shrines are done!
  
All statues were made from scratch (concepting, sculpting, texturing). Took almost a year to complete set, but it was a fun journey :)**
  
  
**This mod replaces some of existing Daedric shrines, also places new ones across the map for you to discover.
  
Statues itself don't give you blessing, but if you have religion mods installed there are compatibility patches.**

**Daedric Princes covered: Azura, Boethiah, Clavicus Vile, Hermaeus Mora, Hircine, Malacath, Mehrunes Dagon, Mephala, Meridia, Molag Bal, Namira, Nocturnal, Peryite, Sanguine, Sheogorath, Vaermina. 
  
Note about Jyggalag:** His existence is controversial, also I doubt he has worshippers  in Skyrim . But I made shrine for him - [download here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80679)﻿*
  
*-------------------------------
  
For best and bug free experience use this mod on **new save**.

  
I**f you are installing mod on existing save and you're experiencing issues with Vaermina or Peryite shrines, make sure to download bat file from files section and put it in game main folder (not in "Data" folder). Open in-game console and type bat DS.*[Various patches by Xtudo](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78809)
  

Meridia's original voice actor is great, but If you want to something new I recommend this mod - [Meridia Revised - A New Voice](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86483) . I think it fits my statue better.﻿
