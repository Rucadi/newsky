* [font=Tahoma]Fabled Forests fills the world with 45,000 tree alterations and placements from the combined placements of the amazing mods ﻿[Traverse the Ulvenwald](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57874)﻿ and [Nature of the Wild Lands](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63604)﻿. No region is left untouched (except some of the tundra)![/font]
[font=Tahoma]It replaces all trees in game with assets from [Happy Little Trees](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50961), except they're moody teenagers now.[/font]
  
* The installer comes your choice of 2 performance variants: **2K** and **1K** textures.
﻿The trees have random size distribution, with your pick of the following three mod flavours:
  

 ﻿**Fabled Forests (Author's Choice)**
  
 ﻿ Tall, lush, dense forests to get lost in. The sunlight shines through the canopies creating magnificent rays of light.
  
 ﻿[/font]**Fabled Forests of Mythic Proportions**
  
 ﻿ Even taller, more lush forests that block the sun and create an inescapable labyrinth. Keep your sword and torch handy!
  
 ﻿**Fabled Forests of Vanilla Proportions**[font=Tahoma] ﻿ ﻿All the tree placements, but with sizes closer to vanilla. For those who prefer a more classic feel.

* Install the mod using your mod manager of choice.
LOD generation is optional, but should be generated using DynDoLOD 3 for maximum enjoyments.
