Creates a dense and ancient 'rock forest' in the [Karth River](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Karth_River)
  
* Rock spires also placed along the tributary from Deep Folk Crossing to the Karth River; and along the tributary from Salvius Farm to the Karth River
Includes three distinct elevated and maze-like pathways somewhere in The Reach
  
* Encourages exploration
Provides safe crossings for survival mode - if you can find them!

**Inspiration and Credits**
  
[Markarth Reach Environment Upgrade - Modcompatible](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/45487?tab=description)﻿ developed the idea of the rock spires. Such a great idea! I completely recreated this mod's idea of the rock spires. No assets used from that mod in this one. No other features of [Markarth Reach Environment Upgrade - Modcompatible](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/45487?tab=description)﻿ used in my mod. Just spires! Give a shout-out to [beachboy 1969](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/beachboy1969?gameId=110) and thank them for the fabulous idea!
