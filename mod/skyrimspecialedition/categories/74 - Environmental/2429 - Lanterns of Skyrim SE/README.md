\* OVERVIEW \*

  
This mod add lanterns to main roads, villages, towns and settlements. To avoid immersion breaking I haven't placed tons of lanterns like "Christmas holidays lighting" in villages or like "Highways lighting" for main roads; way far from it.
  
For instance, lanterns in main roads are placed far from each other in wild areas and some main roads are intentionally not covered.
  
Please take note that some settlements have already lanterns from Vanilla setup. To prevent CTD and glitches, these vanilla lanterns are left completely untouched from me!

\* LOADING ORDER \*

  
[/color][/size]This mods edit many exterior cells of Skyrim, so the good loading order is:
  
  
- Skyrim
  
- Update
  
- Lanterns of Skyrim
  
- Unofficial Skyrim Patch (or USSEP)
  
- DLCs and Unofficial patches
  
- ... All other mods
  
  
This to allow the Unofficial Patch to properly edit the exterior cells data like the locations.
