**Madmen - A Forsworn Overhaul**
  
  
"You want to know who the Forsworn are? We are the people who must pillage our own land. Burn our own ground. We are the scourge of the Nords. The axe that falls in the dark. The scream before the gods claim your soul. We are the true sons and daughters of the Reach. The spirits and hags have lived here from the beginning, and they are on our side. Go back. Go back and tell your Empire that we will have our own kingdom again. And on that day, we will be the ones burying your dead in a land that is no longer yours."
  
- Cortoran, Forsworn warrior

Madmen is intended to be a complete overhaul of the Forsworn faction's enemies, including Hagravens and Witches. This mod introduces some much-needed identity to the Forsworn, featuring a large thematic shift away from "antler bandits", focusing instead on spiritual, shamanistic abilities for the Forsworn themselves, while the Hagravens and Witches practice darker, more sinister magics. Each new NPC added to the game has a completely unique appearance, all made by hand. With additional tiers of enemies, increased level caps, adjusted stats and perks, new spells, 4 new enemy types, and a greatly expanded loot pool of enchanted and magical items, Forsworn enemies will pose a significantly greater challenge in their own unique ways.

  
**Forsworn Identity, Magic, and Skills:**
  
  
Arguably the biggest issue with vanilla Forsworn is a lack of theme and identity to their enemies. We really only get to face archers, fighters, and typical mages, making it a difficult task to differentiate between bandits and Forsworn, despite massive lore differences. Forsworn are described as the ancestral inhabitants of the Reach and a branch of typical Bretons, practicing old magic, worshiping Daedra and communing with spirits, and performing horrifying magical rituals to gain power. We see some of this with the lore surrounding Briarhearts and Hagravens, but very little of this unique identity comes through in gameplay. Rectifying this was one of my primary goals when designing Madmen.
  
  
The Forsworn faction can effectively be broken down into multiple separate groups within that faction: Forsworn, Briarhearts, Witches, and Hagravens. The closer you get to Hagraven and Daedric influence, the darker the magic becomes. How this translates to gameplay is as follows:
  
  
Forsworn magic initially consists of Shock Destruction spells, Flesh Alteration spells, and Animal Familiar Conjuration spells. Briarheart magic incorporates Poison Restoration spells instead of Shock, but still maintains Flesh and Familiar spells. Witches use Poison, Alteration, and Necromancy, and finally Hagravens use Poison, Alteration, and can directly summon the Undead. There is some additional nuance when it comes to certain variants of Forsworn and Briarheart enemies, but this is the general progression for enemies through "regular, if somewhat unique" magic into "dark and twisted" magic. Specifics of what each enemy variant can do will be listed in a later section.
  
  
**Forsworn Racial Changes, Stats, and Scaling System:**To accompany the more unique approach to the spells and skills used by the Forsworn faction, changes have also been made to set the enemies apart on a functional level. All Forsworn and Briarheart (not Witch) enemies are now considered Reachfolk, an offshoot of the Breton race. While functionally still Bretons for the sake of compatibility, they receive unique racial bonuses when compared to their cousins. All Reachfolk have an innate 50% Shock Resistance, as well as a 10% chance to absorb hostile spells. The vanilla game really lacks enemies with a resistance to Shock magic, so this allows for an additional gameplay consideration when choosing your element, as well as keeping Reachfolk in-line with their traditionally magic-resistant heritage.
  
  
Hagravens are permanently altered from the rituals used to create them, and are now functionally Magicka black holes. They have a 25% chance to absorb hostile spells, but no innate resistances. Their claw attacks will also drain magicka from any enemy they hit, fueling their ability to continually cast spells.
  
  
In the vanilla game, there are only 5 tiers of Forsworn available to be encountered, despite a 6th tier hidden in the game data. Witches only have 2 tiers, and there is literally only one version of Hagraven in the entire game. This effectively works out to Forsworn enemies reaching a max level of 34 for non-bosses and 38 for bosses, Witches reaching a max level of 8, and Hagravens only ever spawning at level 20. I redesigned all existing tiers for these enemies, as well as added significantly more, in order to allow them to scale with the player throughout a playthrough and always represent a sizable challenge.
  
  
To accompany these higher levels and stats, enemies actually receive proper perk support, now. In vanilla, Forsworn enemies were lucky to get more than a handful of perks for their skills. Madmen ensures that Forsworn, Hagravens, and witches all have access to all perks that are appropriate to their class and overall theme, as long as that perk will not be useless or actively detrimental to the game experience. The flat "bonus x% damage" perks that were added to some enemies as compensation for not having actual perks have been removed, allowing for enemies with higher damage and survivanility that also present these strengths in unique manners.

**Enemy Variants:**
  
  
Alongside improved leveling and revamped stats, the playstyles and variety of enemies have been expanded. The central theme of the faction as a whole remains, but how this theme is expressed will now vary between enemies, [size=3]and players will have to adapt to their specific strengths and weaknesses to achieve victory.

**Forsworn Archetypes**
  
Spoiler
  
Archer (Ranged) - As in vanilla, these enemies wield bows and arrows to attack from afar, and rely on their dagger and light armor to protect
  
them in melee range.
  

  
* Primary Skills: Archery, Light Armor
Secondary Skills: Alteration, One-handed
  
* Non-boss variants only

  
Berserker (Melee) - These warriors dual wield one-handed weapons and fight with all the ferocity and recklessness such a style entails, and would gladly die rather than face capture. When falling below half health, they will enter a rage that increases both their damage dealt and taken.

  
* Primary Skills: Light Armor, One-handed
Secondary Skills: Alteration
  
* Boss and non-boss variants

  
Gravesinger (Mage) - "Blessed" by Molag Bal, these mages wield dark, corrupted magics, including Bloodroot Necromancy, which infests a corpse with twisted thorns that command the dead to obey.
  

  
* Primary Skills: Alteration, Conjuration, Restoration
Secondary Skills: Light Armor
  
* Non-boss variants only

  
Hagraven (Mage) - A twisted cross between woman and raven, these creatures delve into the darkest and most obscene of magics. Their very essence has been permanently altered by the ritual used to create them.
  

  
* Primary Skills: Alteration, Conjuration, Restoration

  
Shaman (Mage) - Mages that wear light armor and wield Shock magic for offense. Their ability to commune with the spirits of the Reach allow them to summon Animal Familiars to aid them in combat, and Briarheart Shamans are able to further enhance their summoned Familiars with protective spells.
  

  
* Primary Skills: Alteration, Conjuration, Destruction (Briarhearts use Restoration)
Secondary Skills: Light Armor
  
* Boss and non-boss variants

  
Skinchanger (Melee Hybrid) - Fearsome foes that have dedicated their lives to the study of magic and a fervent devotion to Hircine, these enemies can enhance their martial prowess with elemental cloaks and protective spells, then transform into vicious werebeasts to decimate their prey.
  

  
* Primary Skills: Alteration, Destruction (Briarhearts use Restoration)
Secondary Skills: Light Armor
  
* Boss and non-boss variants can be encountered after level 19

  
Spiritcaller (Ranged Hybrid) - Archers that supplement their marksmanship with the support of Animal Familiars, they are able to rain down arrows while their spirit occupies their foes.
  

  
* Primary Skills: Archery, Conjuration, Light Armor
Secondary Skills: Alteration
  
* Non-boss variants only

  
Witch (Mage) - Members of Hagraven covens, these women have been outcast by society. They practice their magics together, learn how to control the dead, and wait for the day that they may be chosen to become a higher being
  

  
* Primary Skills: Alteration, Conjuration, Restoration

  
Witchblade (Melee Hybrid) - Warrior and mage both, these fighters combine martial prowess with magical might in order to fight in any circumstance. Assisted by their Animal Familiars, they make fearsome and versatile enemies.
  

  
* Primary Skills: Alteration, Destruction (Briarhearts use Restoration), One-handed
Secondary Skills: Conjuration, Light Armor
  
* Boss and non-boss variants

**Animal Familiar and Undead Summons**Animal Familiars have a general progression of Wolf -> Sabre Cat -> Bear, and they will scale with additional armor, Magic Resist, Health/Magicka/Stamina, and damage as they level. Undead summons have variants for each tier, including archers, mages, and melee fighters. Some skeletons will use Forsworn equipment, while others will carry Ancient Nord gear. Their magic and any enchanted weapons will also differ, with Forsworn skeletons wielding Shock magic and weapons, while Nordic skeletons wield Frost. They will scale with additional armor, Magic Resist, Health/Magicka/Stamina, and damage as they level.**Item Changes and Additions:**
  
Forsworn aren't exactly known to have the greatest variety when it comes to their equipment. However, that equipment also serves to further solidify their unique theme and identity, so I didn't want to change this. As a compromise, non-boss Forsworn will continue to use their traditional equipment, with a few additions to further their visual flair.
  
  
Forsworn Daggers have been added to the game, and are carried by all Archers, Gravesingers, Shamans, and Spiritcallers, as well as the occasional Witch. Gravesingers, Shamans, and Witchblades have a chance to wear a new Forsworn Hood, adding some variety from the typical headdress. Appropriate death item lists have been distributed to all Forsworn, meaning that you will more often find small amounts of gold and maybe some food on warriors, while mages may carry potions, soul gems, or scrolls.
  
  
In addition to these pieces of regular equipment, all instances of staves carried by Forsworn or found in Forsworn loot are now replaced with unique Forsworn staves. There are Forsworn staves available for every single spell in the Vanilla game, and the Simonrim addon contains variants for every single appropriate Mysticism spell.
  
  
Briarheart enemies have also had their inventory expanded. They will now always carry enchanted weaponry, specifically new enchanted variants of Forsworn axes, daggers, and swords, all of which follow the typical distribution of enchantments given to Vanilla bosses. The Simonrim addon adds even more enchanted variants that bosses can use. Given that Briarhearts now scale to significantly higher levels than their vanilla counterparts, they also have a chance to carry high-level enchanted weapons, up to Ebony tier at level 46. They will always be heavily weighted towards enchanted Forsworn weapons, but they will have a chance to carry enchanted Elven weapons after level 27, enchanted Glass weapons after 36, and enchanted Ebony weapons after 46. For boss enemies that do not use weaponry, such as Briarheart Skinchangers and Hagravens, they will instead carry a large assortment of rare alchemical ingredients and soul gems.
  
  
These changes and additions to Forsworn equipment will ensure that players are well-rewarded for their adventures, while preserving the core identity of Forsworn as materially-poor but magically-rich, as established by lore.
  
  
Witch enemies have had their wardrobe massively expanded. Instead of only having Warlock robes and boots available, Witches can now wear an assortment of numerous Vanilla robes, some of which were never distributed anywhere else. Witches can wear hooded or hoodless variants of Black, Blue, Brown, Green, Grey, Necromancer, Red, and Warlock robes, and all robe variants can also carry appropriate vanilla enchantments.
  
  
When it comes to raw gold, Forsworn enemies and loot have always been very sparse, and I wanted to maintain that general scarcity to keep in-line with established lore, but also provide slight improvements to better reward the players for tackling significantly more powerful enemies. The gold dropped by Forsworn enemies has received extremely slight increases, simply just ensuring that a handful of gold will drop from enemies rather than only a chance. You'll still get what basically amounts to pennies, but you will find those pennies consistently.
  
  
Forsworn chests have had the upper limits on their gold distribution increased. Regular chests have had the upper limit of their gold increased from 125 at level 24, to 200 at level 36. Boss chests have had the upper limit of their gold increased from 150 at level 26, to 250 at level 46. All of these chests will also draw gold values from your current level or below, so you won't always obtain the same amount of gold upon reaching certain levels. You will find slightly more gold in Forsworn dungeons, but the real prize comes from claiming the enchanted staves and weapons from enemies.
  
  
**NPC Consistency Specifics**
  
  
With the introduction of these new types of enemies, unique classes, combat styles, and equipment need to be properly distributed to enemies. In order for certain classes to function properly and behave as designed, they need to inherit certain template flags, specifically AI data. In the majority of cases, a leveled NPC is placed in a location, they inherit all of the proper flags from their template to make my changes function correctly, and everything works out great. However, there are situations where that is not the case.
  
  
Hagraven spawns in particular need an almost complete overhaul. Since the vanilla game only included the one Hagraven type, the Leveled Modifier setting for all Hagraven spawns didn't do anything, so that setting was either ignored or set to arbitrary values. Madmen adjusts existing Leveled Modifiers for Hagraven spawns and also adds ones where they were missing.
  
  
In order to adjust for certain placed NPCs that follow different AI conventions for one reason or another (initially not hostile, warning aggro radius, involved with a different faction, etc etc) individual NPC record edits need to be made. I have tried to use as light of a hand as I can, but in order to provide the most comprehensive experience for users possible, there will be edits made to a small amount of individual Forsworn-associated NPC records, including enemy placement within certain dungeons. There is no way to avoid these additional edits while also providing proper consistency and variety within enemies. I will work to provide patches where possible, and welcome feedback on mods that users would consider high priority for consistency and compatibility patches.
  
  
**Addons**
  
In an attempt to provide a customizable experience that is approachable for as many users as possible, I have separated additional functionality into a handful of addons designed to allow players to choose what best fits their needs. Addons will be made available through either the main FOMOD installer for users who want a streamlines process, or individual files for users who want to manually pick and choose.
  
  
**Simonrim Addon** (requires Mysticism, Adamant, and Thaumaturgy)
  

  
* Distributes a comprehensive suite of perks, spells, and new enchantments to enemies as is appropriate

  
* Stand-outs include: ﻿[list]
Significantly expanded spell pool for all casters
  
* Vastly expanded enchantment pool for weapons and staves

  
[/list]
  
**Darenii's Spell Addons** (Abyss and Natura)
  

  
* The Abyss addon distributes Shadow spells to Hagravens, and adds Abyss scrolls, spell tomes, and Forsworn staves to Forsworn and Hagraven loot
The Natura addon distributes Stone, Water, Wind, and Locust spells to Forsworn and Witches, and adds Natura scrolls, spell tomes, and Forsworn staves to Forsworn, Witch, and Hagraven loot
  

  
**Expanded Enemy Coverage**

  
* This file addresses named NPCs that are associated with the Forsworn faction, but not directly enemies. These NPCs include the Forsworn agents and prisoners within Markarth, Silvia at the Darklight Tower, and Anise in her cabin

  
**Leveled List Difficulty**

  
* In the vanilla game, enemy spawns select what enemy to spawn between the highest leveled version appropriate to the spawn difficulty and all levels lower than that version
These addons simply change it so that enemy spawns only choose the highest leveled version appropriate to the spawn difficulty
  
* As an example: If you are level 19 and an enemy spawn point has a difficulty of 1.0, the vanilla game would select any enemies from level 19, 14, or 9 lists. With these addons, you will only encounter enemies from the level 19 list
This is an extremely minimal change that will bring a significant amount of difficulty, especially when facing large groups
  

  
**Compatibility and Conflicts**
  
  
This mod is intended to be an all-encompassing overhaul for Forsworn enemies, which includes their stats, perks, spells, behavior, and equipment. Madmen is not designed to be used alongside any other Forsworn overhauls.
  
  
Make sure to load this after mods that adjust combat style records, such as Blade and Blunt, to ensure that Madmen's changes take priority.
  
  
Given the high quantity of vanilla records adjusted, combined with an extreme amount of additional records, conflict and inconsistency between other mods are bound to occur. I will provide patches for mods that I use and know need conflict and consistency resolution, and those already brought to my attention. If additional patching is required for mods I am not aware of, I will do my best to provide them. I encourage users to attempt patching for themselves, and will be hosting additional patches provided by individuals whose skills I trust.
  
  
Facegen files are included for all new NPCs. If you're using mods that provide different facegen for Forsworn and Witches, WITHOUT RECORD EDITS, I would suggest loading those after Madmen. If your appearance mods DIRECTLY EDIT RECORDS, they will need to be patched.
  
  
**Available Patches**
  
Patches will be made available through either a FOMOD installer for users who want a streamlines process, or individual files for users who want to manually pick and choose. Descriptions of what each patch addresses will be made available in the FOMOD installer as well as on this mod page.

**Installation**
