Ever been fighting a dragon and it goes off to fight some random NPC or animal on the other side of the mountain?
  
 Well this mod aims to fix that. It's like [I'm Talking To You](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68442) but for dragons.
  
  
When you start fighting a dragon it will periodically check if you or your companions are the dragon's target. If you're not the dragon will stop fighting what it shouldn't be and fly back over to your party.
  
  
In the MCM menu, you can choose how often it checks if you're the target. Default is 20 seconds.
  
  
If any dragons react poorly to this mod, let me know in the posts and I'll add it to the blacklist.
