**Removes treasure loot from animals and creatures. This is also compatible with modded enemies that use this leveled list. (e.g. [Immersive Creatures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12680))
  
  
This mod only touches 1 leveled list and sets the chance of that list for treasures to 0%. Therefore it's compatible with everything, just load it after any mod that changes the creature treasure leveled list.**
