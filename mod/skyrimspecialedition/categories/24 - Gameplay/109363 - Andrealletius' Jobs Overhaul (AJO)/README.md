**Description**
  
  
This mod allows you to get employed by many business in Skyrim, to earn some gold and gain additional rewards.
  
  
You can get employed in the following jobs:
  
Spoiler

  
* Acolyte
Alchemist
  
* Blacksmith
Caretaker
  
* Court Wizard
Farm Hand
  
* Ferryman
Fletcher
  
* Guard
Innkeeper
  
* Librarian
Lumberjack
  
* Miner
Pawnbroker
  
* Stable Hand
Stall Merchant
  
* Tailor
  
  
This mod replaces "handing in" crops, ores or wood to farmers, miners and lumberjack. This works well with mods that add ownerships to crops, ores, etc. As such, you can still help farmers, miners and lumberjacks, without stealing their goods and selling it back to them. I always found this a terrible way to help them. Improving that was basically my main inspiration for this mod.
  
  
**How it works**
  
  
First, you need to talk to a potential employer and ask if they acually need help. The employer needs to be at their usual workplace.
  
Several employers will only give a job when their relevant quests have been done, for instance, the tutorial blacksmithing quest.
  
  
If they need help, you can work for them for 6 hours, provided you have the required tools. (If they don't need help, come back the following day, as they may be in need by then.)
  
  
If you do, the screen will go black briefly while you perform the job. (This will pass 6 in game hours.)
  
  
A random roll will be made, to determine how well you've performed.
  
  
Your success will vary on, based on various factors:
  
  
Spoiler

  
* Your level in the relevant skills (for instance, Alchemy, when helping Alchemists).
Your level in the relevant job. (viewable in the MCM)
  
* Your reputation with your employer. (viewable in the MCM)
The difficulty of said job and work conditions. (ill-tempered or rude employer, cold weather conditions, etc)
  
  
  
Each job has one or more associated skills. Your current level in these skills influence the success of the roll and may also increase afterwards, depending on the outcome.
  
I've included the formula after each skill, so for instance (1/10) means roughly around 1 tenth of the skill's level is added to the roll's outcome.
  
  
Spoiler
  

  
* Acolyte: Restoration (1/7.5)
Alchemist: Alchemy (1/7.5)
  
* Blacksmith: Smithing (1/7.5)
Caretaker: Restoration (1/10)
  
* Court Wizard: All magic skills including enchanting. (1/20 each) (You gain experience in a random magic skill.)
Farm Hand: Alchemy and 2H (1/15 each)
  
* Ferryman: 1H and Speech (1/15 each)
Fletcher: Archery (1/7.5)
  
* Guard: Speech, 1H, 2H, Heavy Armor, Light Armor, Archery, Block (1/20 each) (You gain experience in a random skill from this list.)
Innkeeper: Speech (1/10)
  
* Librarian: Speech (1/7.5)
Lumberjack: 1H and 2H (1/15 each)
  
* Miner: 1H and Smithing (1/15 each) -> If [Deepborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/151948) is installed, it uses Deepborn's mining skill instead.
Pawnbroker: Speech (1/7.5)
  
* Stall Merchant: Speech (1/7.5)
Stable Hand: Speech and Smithing (1/15 each)
  
* Tailor: Light Armor (1/7.5)

  
  
  
After your job is done, you can talk to your employer to get your reward. (for miners, you'll need to talk to their foreman instead.) For balance reasons, you cannot start working a new job the next day, if you haven't received your reward from the previous one yet.
  
  
Depending on your result, you'll get paid a certain amount. In addition, you'll gain reputation with your employer and experience in the relevant skills and job. Lastly, if you perform very well, you'll receive an additional reward.
  
  
You result can be:
  
  
Spoiler

  
* Very poorly: tool broken, big reputation penalty, minimum experience gain, no pay.
Poorly: small reputation penalty, very small experience gain, no pay
  
* Sufficiently: very small reputation gain, small experience gain, small payment
Well: small reputation gain, mediocre experience gain, mediocre payment
  
* Great: mediocre reputation gain, big experience gain, big payment
Amazing: big reputation gain, very big experience gain, very big payment, additional reward.
  
  
  
Job levels are capped at 20. (start at 1)
  
Reputation values are capped at a minimum of -100 and a maximum of 100.
  
  
Required tools:
  
Spoiler

  
* Acolyte: an amulet of the relevant diety, or a broom, if there aren't any amulets for said deity.
Alchemist: a broom (to clean up)
  
* Blacksmith: a blacksmith hammer, bellows or tongs
Caretaker: an amulet of Arkay
  
* Court Wizard: a filled Greater or Grand Soul Gem
Ferryman: an oar
  
* Farm Hand: a shovel or pitchfork
Guard: A uniform of the relevant guards
  
* Fletcher: An unenchanted and untempered iron or steel dagger
Innkeeper: a broom
  
* Librarian: a quill
Lumberjack: a woodcutter's axe
  
* Miner: a pickaxe
Pawnbroker: a broom
  
* Stable Hand: a hammer or pitchfork
Stall Merchant: a broom
  
* Tailor: an unenchanted and untempered iron or steel dagger
  
  
You can buy tools at pawnbrokers. You can also buy guard uniforms at the relevant hold's Blacksmith.
  
  
In case of Winterhold, you can buy a Winterhold guard uniform at [Birna's Oddments](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Birna%27s_Oddments).
  
In case of Morthal/Hjaalmarch, I've added a Guard quartermaster to the inn.
  
  
You can also disable these requirements using console commands. (mentioned down below at Customization)
  
  
Here's a list of potential employers. Do keep in mind that several NPCs have restrictions, like completing relevant quests, or when they take over from a deceased business owner.

**Requirements**
  
  

  
* [SKSE64](https://skse.silverlock.org/)
[SkyUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12604)
  
* [~~SPID~~](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869) (no longer a requirement for v1.5+ of AJO.)
[BEES](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441) (if you use an older version of SE/AE, pre 1.6.1130)
  

  
**Compatibility**
  
  
At some point hopefully, I'll adress businesses in other bigger mods to include them.
  
  
I have included an optional file for first person messages.
  
  
There's another synergy patch for my [Clue Scrolls](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80542) mod. If you perform amazing at a job, you have a large chance on getting a clue scroll as additional reward.
  
  
This mod is incompatible with:
  

  
* [Favor Jobs Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40145) -> both edit favor jobs for farmers, miners and lumberjack.

  
Make sure to load this mod AFTER [RDO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1187).
  
  
There's a patch available for CACO, Campfire and Crafting Requires Tools - Extended [on this page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120126). It uses FLM, so there is only one esp that removes the broom and edits the requirement message. The formlist is edited through a \_FLM.ini file.
  
  
This mod has inbuild compatibility with [Deepborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/151948) If Deepborn is installed, AJO will detect it and apply the following:
  

  
* Use the mining skill from Deepborn for mining jobs, instead of Smithing + One-Handed.
When completing a mining job, you'll gain some experience in the mining skill from Deepborn. The amount of experience is based off of the multiplier from Deepborn, and how well you performed at the job.
  
* The Commission Expert perks from Deepborn will be applied to any job payments from AJO for mining jobs.

  
  
**Customization**
  
  
You can use console commands to customize parts of this mod.
  
  
**Changing how often employers need help**
  
  
Spoiler
  

```
set AJO_NoNeedChance to X
```

  
X is the chance that employers won't need help. Default is 20.
  
  
  
**Changing payment rewards**
  
  
Spoiler
  
The following globals control the base values for payments:
  
  

  
* AJO\_Pay03\_Min: minimum payment (without modifiers) when performed "sufficiently" (default: 25)
AJO\_Pay03\_Max: maximum payment (without modifiers) when performed "sufficiently" (default: 100)
  
* AJO\_Pay04\_Min: minimum payment (without modifiers) when performed "well" (default: 100)
AJO\_Pay04\_Max: maximum payment (without modifiers) when performed "well" (default: 250)
  
* AJO\_Pay04\_Min: minimum payment (without modifiers) when performed "great" (default: 250)
AJO\_Pay05\_Max: maximum payment (without modifiers) when performed "great" (default: 500)
  
* AJO\_Pay06\_Min: minimum payment (without modifiers) when performed "amazing" (default: 500)
AJO\_Pay06\_Max: maximum payment (without modifiers) when performed "amazing" (default: 750)
  

  
  
You can change the values by using the following command:
  
  

```
set <globalname> to X
```

  
  
For instance, if you want to set the minimum amount of sufficiently to 30 you can use the following command:
  
  

```
set AJO_Pay03_Min to 30
```

  
  
Warning: The minimum amounts should always be lower than the maximum amounts, in the relevant categories.
  
So for instance AJO\_Pay03\_Min always needs to be lower than AJO\_Pay03\_Max.
  
If they aren't, it may cause CTDs. So be warned.
  
  
  
**Changing job roll success range**
  
  
Spoiler
  
You can use the following command to increase/decrease your success ranges:
  
  

```
set AJO_JobRollMax to X
```

  
X is the max amount of the job roll, without modifiers. (default value is 75)
  
  
  
**Toggling tool requirements**
  
  
Spoiler
  

```
set AJO_NoToolReqs to X
```

  
  
If set to 1, tool requirements are disabled. If set to 0, tool requirements are active. (default value is 0) There's also an optional file to disable tool requirements.
  
  
  
**Toggling shift requirements**
  
  
Spoiler
  

```
set AJO_NoShifts to X
```

  
  
If set to 1, shift requirements are disabled, this means you're not limited to receive jobs between 9 am and 3 pm. If set to 0, these requirements are active. (default value is 1)
  
  
  
Do NOT edit any of the other globals, as that can cause issues.
  
  
**FAQ**
  
  
Q: xEdit gives an error! Help!
  
A: Use a newer version of xEdit, or consider using the x64 counterpart of your current version of xEdit.
  
  
Q: Will you replace the black screens with actual quests/minigames?
  
A: Unless you know a good and viable way to do this, no, I'm not going to. Keep in mind that this mod is character's skill based, not player skill based.
  
  
Q: ESPFE?
  
A: Yes.
  
  
Q: Does installing/updating/uninstalling on an existing save work?
  
A: As far as I know, it should. However, it's good practice to keep a backup save prior to doing this, just in case.
  
  
Q: Is this compatible with <insert mod>?
  
A: I don't know by heart. You might need to check yourself.
  
  
Q: Will you make a patch for <insert mod>?
  
A: Only if it's a mod I use myself or plan on using it, I have enough time and I actually like the idea. Otherwise, feel free to do it yourself. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: I have a suggestion to improve the mod. Can you do it?
  
A: Maybe, if I have time and I like the idea, I'll consider it.
  
  
Q: Will you port this to <insert platform>?
  
A: No, I myself only support the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If someone else wants to port it, feel free. (see permission) If you decide to port it, you yourself take full responsibility to offer support to said port. I will not provide no support for any ports by third parties.
  
  
Q: I use a ported version of this mod on <insert platform> and I have a problem. Can you help?
  
A: I don't provide any support for third party ports on other platforms than the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If you have issues, you should adress the person that ported it.
