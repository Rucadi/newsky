# Xtended Stay - Rent Inn Room for Longer Time and Extend Time
- Author: lilebonymace
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78177


**Description**
  
  

  
* Changes the dialogue "I'd like to rent a room." so that after selecting it you choose the number of days (1-7, 14 or 30) to rent the room for.
Adds an ability to extend the time if you already rented the room, instead of the ability to try to rent room and get a response that you already rented it. Choose the dialogue "I'd like to stay here longer." and then choose the number of days. The choosen number of days is added to the remaining time. The remaining number of days is displayed in brackets at the end of this dialogue.
  

**Compatibility**
  

  
* Compatible with mods that change the room cost (even with those that do it dynamically, like location-based).
Conflicts with other mods that edit RentRoomScript.pex (this may include other mods changing how inns work) and the vanilla rental dialogues. Of course nothing must overwrite this mod.
  
* Mod-added inns that have unique room renting dialogues require a patch, ones that use vanilla dialogues don't require patches (easy to check in the game if it works).
Has a patch: [size=2][size=2][Inns Can Be Closed](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57407).[/size][/size]
