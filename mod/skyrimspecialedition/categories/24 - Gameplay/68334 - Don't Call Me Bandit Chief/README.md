# Don't Call Me Bandit Chief

No longer will the mini bosses you kill just be called "Bandit Chief". This mod features 70 immersion friendly names for male and female bandit chiefs each. I've also updated the mod so that orcs have their own name types, not Nordic names.
  
  
This includes bandit chiefs from random encounters as well as chiefs you are given a bounty for. Any character who's original name is "Bandit Chief" will have a name.
  
  
I did my best to keep the names immersive as possible but I'm no expert on Nordic names, so if one is horribly inaccurate let me know and I can change it.
  
  
  
This mod requires SKSE but is compatible with both AE and SE.
  
  
This mod is highly compatible. It should work with any mod, including mods like OBIS, without any problems. It doesn't alter any enemies or leveled lists. Install any time.
