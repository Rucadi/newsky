**Compatibility and Load Order**
  
  
Compatible with everything. No vanilla records were altered. Unlike [Elemental Weathers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76336) which requires compatibility patches to detect new weathers added by weather mods, this version only detects if there is rain or snow in the current weather. Meaning it requires no patches and will apply the same effects from rainy or snowy weather as in [Elemental Weathers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76336).
