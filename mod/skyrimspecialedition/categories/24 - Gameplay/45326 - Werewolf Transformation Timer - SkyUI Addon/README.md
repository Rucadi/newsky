# Werewolf Transformation Timer - SkyUI Addon
- Author: weds4
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45326


This mod adds a new icon and timer when the player enters beast form that shows how long is left in the current transformation. There are 4 different icon presets you can choose from, and you can customize the widget's size, transparency, location, and the text's color and size using the mod's MCM.
  
One of the presets for the icon matches the coloring used in ElSopa's [Colored SkyUI Active Effect Icons SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23897)﻿ so that users of that mod can color match if they wish.
  
  
  
This mod is verified compatible with Growl, Moonlight Tales, and Manbeast.
  
  
  
Known Issues:
  
When first installing on an in-progress playthrough, the widget might not show on the first transformation. The fix is to make a new save and then load it. Everything else should work fine.
