# Quest Start Tweaks

There are quite a lot of vanilla quests that have starting conditions which don't really make a lot of sense in a modded game, some not even in vanilla. Mods like [Timing is Everything](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25464), [Delayed Quest Starts](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72751) and [Missing in Action Delayed](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67893) fix a lot of these, but there were still a couple left that I felt were in need of a little tweaking.
  
  
**[size=6][font=Georgia]The Ebony Warrior[/font]**
  
  
**How it used to work:**
  
In the vanilla game the Ebony Warrior confronts you when you hit level 80. Back when this quest was originally added to the game it made a lot of sense, as the player level cap was 81. But since then the legendary skills were added and the number 80 lost its special meaning. This is even more true when using mods like [Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751) or [Skyrim Skill Uncapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8889) which completely change how levels are gained.
  
  
**How it works now:**
  
The level requirement has been removed, and the Ebony Warrior shows up after certain quests have been completed. If you want to know what these are check under the spoiler, or you can leave it as a surprise. Spoiler [Dragonslayer](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Dragonslayer)
  
[Kindred Judgment](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Kindred_Judgment)
  
[At the Summit of Apocrypha](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/At_the_Summit_of_Apocrypha)
  
Or in other words, Alduin, Harkon and Miraak are dead 
  
**Compatibility:**
  
The only conflicts are with mods that edit the Ebony Warrior start directly.

**[font=Georgia]Letter from the Jarl of Falkreath[/font]**
  
**How it used to work:**
  
This quest was added in the Hearthfire expansion to guide the player to the new content, the build your own house system. When certain conditions are met, the player receives a letter via the courier, inviting them to see the current Jarl of Falkreath. The vanilla conditions are as follows:
  
[/size]

  
* Reach level 9
Relationship rank below 2 with the Jarls of Falkreath, Hjaalmarch and Pale
  
* No bounty in Falkreath

This served as a good way to get players quickly to the new content when Hearthfire was released, but in the present day I always feel like the letter arrives way too early. The letter references the "fame of the player's exploits across Skyrim", yet in a typical playthrough I have barely left Whiterun when I hit level 9.
  
  
**[size=4]How it works now:**
  
These are the new conditions for the letter to be sent:[/size]

  
* Reach level 16
Relationship rank below 2 with the current Jarl of Falkreath
  
* Player has completed some prominent quests in the other hold capitals
No bounty in Falkreath
  

Bumping the level requirement from 9 to 16 moves the quest from the early game to mid game. The relationship rank restrictions for Hjaalmarch and Pale were removed as counterproductive, as the goal is to have the player do more around Skyrim before receiving the letter, not less. Several quest requirements were added to ensure the player has actually gained some fame in other parts of Skyrim, instead of just crafting iron daggers in Whiterun.
  
  
The exact quest requirements are in the spoiler. Spoiler [Dragon Rising](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Dragon_Rising)﻿

[The Man Who Cried Wolf](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/The_Man_Who_Cried_Wolf)
  
[Rise in the East](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Rise_in_the_East)﻿  Remember that you can always start the Falkreath favour quest by talking to the Jarl there. The letter is just added flavour, no need to wait for it if it's convenient to start the quest early.
  
  
**[size=4]Compatibility:**
  
Incompatible with any mods that edit the quest BYOHHouseBuilding or BYOHHouseBuildingScript.pex. Should be compatible with everything else.
  
[USSEP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266) - compatible, fixes are included.
  
[/size]
  
[size=4]**Closing remarks:**
  
All plugins are flagged ESL. A new game should not be required as long as you haven't triggered the quests yet (they can't be "untriggered" retroactively).
  
If you have other quests you would like to see tweaked, ask in the comments and I'll see what I can do.
