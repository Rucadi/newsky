If you use Starfrost in combination with Gourmet, the duration of food and alcohol buffs gets halved. This mod changes the MAG\_FoodPenaltyPerk variable back from 0.5 to 1.0.
  
  
Useful if you're playing on timescale 10 instead of the standard timescale 20, as it's strange having to eat every 1.67 in game hours to maintain the buffs.
  
  
Additionally, drugging yourself by consuming sleeping tree sap, skooma, or eversnow now lasts four times as long, as these buff durations can not be extended in any way that food and alcohol buffs can.
  
  
**food buffs:** 10 minutes --> 20 minutes (equals 3.33 in game hours on timescale 10)
  
**alcohol buffs:**5 minutes --> 10 minutes (equals 1.67 in game hours on timescale 10)
  
**drug buffs:**5 minutes --> 20 minutes (equals 3.33 in game hours on timescale 10)
