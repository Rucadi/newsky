**GATE TO SOVNGARDE - SMALL MODS AND RESOURCES**
  
[left][/left]

[left]﻿
  
I've developed a lot of mods for GTS that are not worth their own mod page, but that might be interest to some of you. All the files in MAIN FILES are useless to anyone not using the collection. Files in OPTIONAL can be used by anyone, just note the requirements for each.

* [left]﻿**Administer Potions to NPCs - Follower Dialogue**: This patch removes the spell of the original mod and adds the functionality via a follower dialogue. Requires Administer Potions and Poisons. Let these files overwrite the original files.[/left]
[left]**Animated Armoury for GTS** - Includes new books that enable the recipes for the new weapon types, but the patching for GTS is done in another plugin so this one is compatible even without the collection. Technically it does not require the original mod, but GTS downloads the original anyway to give the author some love. Please, do the same and download and endorse the original: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35978[/left]
  
* [left]**Auri Pls Dismount (Definitive Edition) -** My attempt at making sure Auri dismounts her mount so you don't crash while going through a door. My method is very violent, I just push Auri off her mount (lol), but nowadays this shouldn't be needed. The collection is not using this mod anymore though, there are better alternatives out there. Leaving it up in case it's helpful though.[/left]
[left]**Campfire Inventory Injector (I4) Icons**: Icons for the abilities, tents, etc.[/left]
  
* [left]**CC Plugins Universal Start Fix**: When using some alternate start mods, certain CC quests will NEVER ever start. Sounds like fun, huh? Jelidity created this universal fix to solve the issue, without editing any esps or anything. No requirements. Thanks to Jelidity for sharing![/left]
[left]**Delay Bleak Falls Barrow - Voiced**: This is based on an earlier version of At Your Own Pace by agd25. Jarl Balgruuf delays Bleakfalls Barrow in an immersive way, thanks to the power of my splicing. So much wow! No Requirements. It will not work with similar mods though.[/left]
  
* [left]**Description Framework for Alchemy Requires Bottles**: Requires Description Framework. It adds descriptions (duh).[/left]
[left]**Description Framework for Campfire**: Same as the one above.[/left]
  
* [left]**Description Framework for Headhunter**: Yep, same thing![/left]
[left]**Description Framework for Holidays**: You guessed it![/left]
  
* [left]~~**Dirt and Blood - Water Requirement**: This small patch makes "Dirt and Blood" use "Wade in Water Redone" to detect when the player is standing in water, and soap can only be used while standing in water. The wash ability can still be used at any point though, so this is only for the soap.~~ Added to the main mod.[/left]
[left]**Dirt and Blood Inventory Injector (I4) Icons**: Icons for DnB. Requires Inventory Injector and The Handy Icon Collection Collective[/left]
  
* [left]**Female Forsworn Wear Funny Helmets**: The Forsworn helmet doesn't change based on gender anymore.[/left]
[left]**Juniper's Frostflow Lighthouse - GTS Patch**: Requires the original, this is just a patch that tweaks a few small things, ESLfies the ESP, etc.Juniper's Frostflow Lighthouse is a hidden gem that more people should know about, especially if you're into dynamic worlds. Go check it out![/left]
  
* [left]**Mythos - GTS Patch**: Changes a few level conditions, rescues a character from a previous version. Patch between Mythos and GTS. Requires the collection + Mythos. Permissions: "You are free to make patches and don't need to ask for permission."[/left]
[left]**Orc Stalkers Fix**: In theory it helps with the problems of orcs stalking you, but in reality they still pop up unexpected from time to time. Those damn stalker orcs![/left]
  
* [left]**Project AHO - Less Jarring Structures**: This removes the outer rings of the big dwemer structures added by Project AHO. The dock station is still usable and looks good, but is now way less invasive on Skyrim's landscape. Just an ESPFE patch. Requires Project AHO + Bugfix patch.[/left]
[left]**Scion Inventory Injector (I4) Icons:** Requires Inventory Injector and The Handy Icon Collection Collective.[/left]
  
* [left]**Sleeping Heals Diseases:** Every time you go to sleep, you have a chance to heal your illnesses in the morning. No requirements.[/left]
[left]**The Breathing Abyss - Disabled Cabin Patch:** Original mod (The Breathing Abyss) + Ryn's Saarthal required. Main change is that this patch disables the cabin in the worldspace from the OG mod and moves the NPC to a nearby cabin added by Ryn's mod, along with other researchers and mages.[/left]
  
* [left]**Wounds Addon Patch**: A patch that tweaks a few things from Wounds by IronDusk33. Bandages can be applied directly for faster healing, but the original system is still required. Potions that autoheal injuries are gone. Running with a broken leg hurts you, etc.[/left]
[left]**Wounds Misc Objects (I4) Icons**: Requires Inventory Injector and The Handy Icon Collection Collective[/left]
  
* [left]**Delphine Attic Stuck Fix** - For some players, the end of "The Horn of Jurgen Windcaller" can get stuck. This is due to an issue with Interesting NPCs. This small patch makes sure the quest works, no matter what. Safe to install mid-game. I recommend installing this fix if you're using Interesting NPCs or other mods that involve the Riverwood innkeeper Orgnar, as it works great preventively. However, if you already have the issue in your game, then you need to install the patch first, and then type this in the console: "setstage mq106 5"[/left]
