The mod is similar to Extended Encounters, Immersive Creatures Events/Encounters Module and Immersive World Encounters. and IS COMPATIBLE with them.
  
  
Please post your findings.
  
  
Radiance seeks to make your Skyrim experience a little more immersive by adding new world encounters and events that reflect the world and your impact on it. This mod adds over 30 encounters, and with Radiance, you may:
  
  
- Bump into fellow adventurers you've helped in the wild, having adventures of their own!
  
- Suffer the consequences for your actions when your enemies seek revenge!
  
- See the resulting battles when you stir up major conflict throughout the world!
  
- More to come!
  
  
I do NOT have any videos of the mod at this time but the mod it is most similar to and completely compatible with is.

If I haven't updated in a while and you want to make changes to this mod, try dropping me a line at the Bethesda forums. If you don't hear back from me in a week, you have permission to release your own version as you see fit. I've included the script source files in Radiance.bsa for your convenience.
