# Streamlined Fishing

This mod aims to streamline the fishing minigame from the Anniversary update, making it so that you don't have to manually equip a fishing rod from your inventory when you start fishing.
  
  
When you activate the Fishing Supplies, you will either be given a menu prompt to select a fishing rod, or if you only have one, it will be equipped automatically. After each round of fishing, a "Cast Line" prompt will appear, which you can activate to keep fishing with your current rod. You can change your rod by activating the Fishing Supplies again.
