It has always sounded strange to me that Ysgramor would look at an elven Dragonborn so kindly, and an elven Dragonborn not feel any wrath towards Ysgramor.
  
  
This mod allows players who roleplay as a vengeful elf to fight Ysgramor and mark his end forever. Without Shor, the heroes of Sovngarde will not be able to resurrect, and Ysgramor will die his eternal death.

Q&A:
  
  
Q1. Why would anyone want to fight Ysgramor?
  
A1. Because some people roleplay as a vengeful elf and hate Ysgramor for killing the Falmer. More so, if they use mods to roleplay as a Falmer.
  
  
Q2. Would the other heroes of Sovngarde help Ysgramor?
  
A2. No, but the three who help you fight Alduin will help you, because turning them hostile causes complications.
  
  
Q3. Can only the elven players fight him?
  
A3. Any player may fight him, but it makes more sense for an elven player to fight him.
