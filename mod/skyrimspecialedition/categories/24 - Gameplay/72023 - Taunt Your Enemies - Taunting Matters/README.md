**Taunt Your Enemies**

**FEATURES FOR THE PLAYER**
  

  
* Ability (or hotkey) to taunt your enemies
Taunting comes with an animation and sound (menacing grunting!)
  
* Sounds differ per race: Khajiit might HISSSSSS at their enemies, Argonians might make lizzard noises, etc.
Taunting an enemy gives you 25% more damage for 8 seconds, but leaves you open for an enemy attack
  
* You might think this is a silly feature (and so I thought too) but I've been using it this week [for my own character and it's a lot of fun](https://www.twitch.tv/jayserpa/videos)﻿. It's hard to explain, it just adds more strategy to fights and it gives you something else to instinctively do during fights and I'm all for it.

  
**FEATURES FOR NPCs / GENERAL COMBAT**
  

  
* Enemies often use taunt animations in vanilla, but this serves no purpose for them, as it's just basically a free hit for you. The taunting of NPCs remains unchanged with this mod, but it now has an actual purpose.
After a taunt , enemies now get a 25% bonus to damage for 8 seconds, same as the player.
  

  
  
Mod comes with an MCM so you can configure/enable the hotkey, hide the ability in your menu and configure the sound.
  
  
  

**REQUIREMENTS**

  
* Taunting for the player **only has one requirement: [Bug Fixes SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33261)﻿**
The NPC features will only work if you have [Dynamic Animation Casting](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73293)﻿﻿ + [SPID](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869) ﻿installed.

**- Anything to watch out for in terms of compatibility?**No, the mod edits no vanilla records, so 0 clashes.
  
  
**- Is this compatible with mods that change the taunting animation?**Yes.
  
  
**- Can I use an ability/hotkey to activate this?**Yes, mod comes with an MCM for this reason.
  
  
**- Is the mouth animated while grunting?**
  
Yes, if you're using MFG (With Conditional Expressions for example). Mouth movement is disabled by default as usually you can't see the front of your character while in combat, but you can enable it in the MCM if you want.
  
  
**- How do I install DAC?**Same as DAR, you just install it like any other mod. Nothing special to do from your side. 
  
  
**- Is this marked ESL? Can I install this mid-game? ﻿**Yep! Yep!
  
  
**- What are you working on next?**
  
I have a cool mod for conjurers/necromancers in the works, which should release relatively soon. Stay tuned for that one. Once that one is out in August, there'll be a big poll on Patreon\* for you to vote on possible ideas for future mods. We'll see from there.
  
  
\*Please note that **none** of my mods are ever hidden behind a paywall. Nexus always comes first. Supporting me is a "thank you" more than anything else. Don't worry if you can't join Patreon, I still love you all the same. [*Or do I?*](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67930)**- I need MOAR!**
  
Feel free to check the summary of all my main releases these past 2 years! Yep, it's been 2 years since I published my first mod. It's been quite the journey. *Take a look and you might walk out with a couple new mods.*
