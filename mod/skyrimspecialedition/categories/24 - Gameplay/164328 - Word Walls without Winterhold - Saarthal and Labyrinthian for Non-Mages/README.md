Disconnects access to the Nordic ruins of [Saarthal](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Saarthal) and [Labyrinthian](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Labyrinthian) from the [College of Winterhold](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:College_of_Winterhold_(faction)) questline, allowing you to get to the [Ice Form](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ice_Form) and [Slow Time](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Slow_Time) dragon shouts, as well as the bosses [Jyrik Gauldurson](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Jyrik_Gauldurson) ([Forbidden Legend](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Forbidden_Legend)) and [Morokei](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Morokei_(creature)) ([Masks of the Dragon Priests](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dragon_Priest_Mask)) without ever joining the College.
  
  
**Can be installed any time, but only if you have not already joined the College.**
  
  
  
Saarthal
  
  
[Saarthal](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Saarthal) is now unlocked from the start of the game (the College's researchers no longer lock themselves inside...). A couple of new side passages have been added to bypass the College quest scenes - look for a hidden pull handle near where you would usually find the Saarthal Amulet to open a side passage in the main chamber.
  
  
Jyrik Gauldurson is no longer tied to the Eye of Magnus and can instead be found earlier in the ruin. If you come back later during the [Under Saarthal](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Under_Saarthal) quest, the Eye itself is now guarded by an unnamed custodian.
  
  
  
Labyrinthian
  
  
[Labyrinthian](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Labyrinthian) was sealed up by the College in recent memory, but perhaps there is still a way to unlock it hidden away in ancient history...
  
  
SpoilerA copy of the [Torc of Labyrinthian](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Torc_of_Labyrinthian) can now be found on a shelf in [Bromjunaar Sanctuary](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Bromjunaar_Sanctuary).
  
  
Once inside, all scenes related to the College quest are disabled, but the dungeon otherwise plays out as normal (minus the skeletal dragon). Morokei can now be found in the Word Wall chamber, and a hidden pull chain near the Word Wall will open up a quick exit route in the room with the [Ancient Helmet of the Unburned](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ancient_Helmet_of_the_Unburned).
  
  
If you come back later during [The Staff of Magnus](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Staff_of_Magnus), the quest plays out as normal (including the skeletal dragon), but Morokei has left one final surprise for you...
  
  
  
Other Features
  
  

  
* Both Saarthal and Labyrinthian will now respawn like most other dungeons (and are therefore no longer safe for storage).
The College questline can still be completed as normal, regardless of whether or not you've already been through the dungeons beforehand.
  

  
  
Compatibility
  
  

  
* **Patch Included** for [Savos Aren's Regrets](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57677).

  
  
This mod is designed to be as compatible as possible and so doesn't directly edit the Quest Fragment scripts of any related quests. Instead I've edited some parallel scripts including **MG07LabyrinthianDoorSCRIPT**, **MG07WaveTriggerScript** and **SF\_MG02TolfdirCombatScene**.
