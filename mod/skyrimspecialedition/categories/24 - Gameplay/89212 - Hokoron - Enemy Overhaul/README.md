Hokoron is intended to adjust several enemy types such that they continue to challenge the player throughout the later stages of the game. This mod accomplishes this by adding new, higher level variants for several enemy types and tweaking specific enemies.
  
  
**Features**
  

  
* Added high level variants for Hagravens, Wispmothers, Falmer, Dwarven Automatons, Rieklings, Ash Spawn, Gargoyles, Seekers, and Lurkers.
Hagravens now have Frost and Shock variants in addition to their vanilla, fire-wielding counterpart. They will also use more spells such as Expert Destruction spells, cloak spells, and atronach summons.
  
* Several fixes to bizarre scaling present in a few enemy types.
Fixed a vanilla bug where higher level Seekers weren't summoning clones.\*
  
* Lurkers' spit attack is now deadlier. They can also no longer be paralyzed.
Frost Giants can no longer be paralyzed.
  
* Restored an unused Gargoyle model for the new variant.
Rieklings deal bleed damage.
  
* Optional **Difficulty Addon** that ensures only the strongest available enemies are spawned according to your level.

  
**Details**
  
Spoiler**Hagraven**:
  

  
* Level 30, 40, 50 and 60 variants added.
Frost and Shock variants for each level variant.
  
* As Hagravens become higher level, they gain new spells and perks. They will utilize expert spells, atronach summons, and cloak spells as they progress.
Drascua levels with the player and uses fire spells. With the SimonRim file, she will summon Dremora to aid her in battle.
  
* The three unique Hagravens in Altar of Thrond Cave are set to level 50 and each use a different element.

  
[color=#e69138]**Wispmother**:
  

  
* Level 38 and 50 variants added.
All Wispmothers now have a Frost Cloak effect similar to Frost Atronachs.
  

  
**Frost Giant**:
  

  
* Increased Health and Stamina.
Added "ImmuneParalysis" Keyword.
  

**Falmer**:

  
* Level 60 variants for standard Falmer added, and level 65 variants for Falmer bosses added.
Falmer Shaman level scaling adjusted to be in line with other Falmer.
  
* Higher level Falmer bosses appear at lower levels to set them apart from the other Falmer.
Fixed inconsistent Stamina and Magicka scaling on Falmer bosses.
  
* New Falmer variants will utilize Expert spells such as Ebonyflesh and Thunderbolt.

  
**Dwarven Spider**:

  
* Level 22 and 30 variants added.

  
**Dwarven Sphere**:

  
* Level 38, 48 and 60 variants added.
Dwarven Sphere Master renamed to Dwarven Sphere Defender. The name is now reserved for the level 60 variant.
  

  
**Dwarven Centurion**:

  
* Level 44, 54, 65 and 75 variants added.
Dwarven Centurion Master renamed to Dwarven Centurion Defender. The name is now reserved for the level 75 variant.
  
* The Forgemaster now scales up to level 75.

  
**Dwarven Ballista**:

  
* Level 38, 48 and 60 variants added.
Dwarven Ballista Master renamed to Dwarven Ballista Defender. The name is now reserved for the level 60 variant.
  

  
**Riekling**:

* Level 30 variants added. I didn't want to scale them up too much, they are just little guys.
Higher level variants will now appear at earlier levels.
  
* They now deal bleeding damage.

  
**Mounted Riekling**:
  

  
* Level 49 and 60 variants added.

  
**Ash Spawn**:
  

  
* Level 50 and 60 variants added.

  
**Gargoyle**:
  

  
* Level 60 variants added.
Fixed an issue where low level Gargoyles were dealing more damage than intended, and high level Gargoyles were dealing less damage than intended.
  
* Uses an unused Gargoyle model for the new variant. It looks pretty cool!

  
**Seeker**:
  

  
* Level 53 and 65 variants added.
Higher level variants will now appear at earlier levels.
  
* Fixed a vanilla bug where higher level Seekers weren't summoning clones.\*

  
*\*And by "fixing a bug," I mean I changed the implementation of their mirror script. As a result, the clones won't scale, and all Seekers will summon 2 clones. So that's a buff for the lowest level Seeker, I guess. Better than no clones! (EDIT: This was recently fixed by USSEP, I will eventually update my mod to accommodate.)*
  
**Lurker**:
  

  
* Level 64 and 75 variants added.
Added "ImmuneParalysis" Keyword.
  
* Their spit attack has received several upgrades. It now deals damage for 10 seconds rather than 5, also damages your stamina, and shreds your armor. The projectile is also faster and should be easier for them to hit. They're not very good at aiming, though.

**Installation**
  
  
Download and install through your favorite mod manager. **Uninstalling this or any other mod mid-save is not recommended.**
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
  
This mod will likely not be compatible with any mod that edits the same enemy types. I found no conflicts in my own load order of hundreds of mods, so you will need to let me know if there are any serious conflicts.
  
  
Perk overhauls present some minor conflicts with regard to the Perks added to Hagravens. A patch has been provided for [Adamant.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30191?tab=description)
  
A patch has been provided for [Coven](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51596)﻿ that will allow you to use my Hagravens with Coven's witches without conflict.
