Adds [Jod](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Jod) and [Horik Halfhand](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Horik_Halfhand)﻿, Housecarls of Skald Felgeif and Brina Merilis respectively, to the [Steward](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Steward) faction for the purposes of turning in [Bounty Quests](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Bounty_Quests). Now Bounties you receive in the Pale will no longer have a blank space where the Steward's name should be!
  
  
(This doesn't affect the Hearthfire house purchase for the Pale - since there is no dialogue for them to sell you the house, you still need to talk to the Jarl for that.)
