Nightmare Night[/color]***Faster, Stronger, Better. Nightmare Night recreates the Werewolf Transformation to new standards: Introducing a new Blood Frenzy system to overwhelm your foes with incomparable violence and speed, *improved xp gathering*  and *dynamic health regeneration* to support a fast and fluent gameplay.
  
  
Nightmare Night tries to dig deeper than other Werewolf overhauls, addressing not only the issues dwelling on the surface but also those lingering below it to turn the puppy on steroids into the teeth baring horror its supposed to be.[font=Georgia][/font]﻿

[font=Georgia]*1. Blood Frenzy*[/font][font=Georgia]*'Let rage consume you.'*[/font]

  
Every time you kill you will fall into a frenzy, the more blood is spilled, the more enraged you become, increasing strength and speed but also making you more susceptible to damage.
  
  
While Blood Frenzy is active your Magicka Bar will quickly drain, representing the duration which you will be frenzied. Additionally, a new meter will appear on your HUD which will tell you how enraged you currently are. The more this bar is filled up, the greater the effects of blood frenzy. Killing another target fully fills up your Magicka Bar back up and progresses your frenzy
  
\*Kill moves are disabled while frenzied
  
  
  

[font=Georgia]2. Feedin[/font][font=Georgia]g & XP[/font]

*[font=Georgia]'But Scrab, I still need to feed to gain Perks'
  
Jokes on you, I removed that.[/font]*

  
Feeding no longer grants any Experience. Instead Experience will be gathered whenever you kill a target. Further, the amount of Health you recover is now based on your missing Hp, rather than being a fixed Number. This means that the more Hp you have, the less effective Feeding will be.
  
Feeding will calm you, resetting your Blood Frenzy and with it, restoring all your defense at the expense of your offense.

3. Werewolves & Werebears
  
*'We are not the same. We are not equal.'*

[/font]
  

  
* **Werewolves** are fast and enduring hunters. With their firm and muscular body they chase down their prey over long distances and each successful kill only makes them faster...
**Werebears** have an overwhelming strength and are incredibly hard to kill. Their thick pelt grants them Frost and Poison resistance but forces them to take breaks more often. There are rumors that enraged Werebears can tear down entire buildings, unfortunately no one ever lived long enough to confirm this...
  

[left][/left]\*Whether you turn into a Werebear or a Werewolf depends on the Lycan blood running through your veins. You are always either a Werebear or a Werewolf and you cannot change your race without curing yourself first.

[left]Nightmare Night introduces a total of 27 Unique Perks, requiring a total 35 Perk Points to be fully maxed out!
  
When installing the mod mid game, your already spend Perk Points should be removed and given back to you, the Perks required to obtain the next Perk Points will also be adjusted accordingly.[/left]

*\*Nightmare Night requires Nightmare of the Silent Night AND Nightmare of the Lucent Night to be learned first*

[color=#00ffff]5. Howls

[/color][/font]You will have access to all 3 vanilla howls right from the start, accessible through your favorites menu. New abilities you learn will also be placed into this menu.
  
  
[font=Georgia]*5.1 Totems of Hircine*[/font]
  
As in the vanilla game, you may choose 1 of the Totems to strengthen you. Depending on your choice, the associated howl will gain an additional effect:
  
  

  
1. **Totem of the Hunt**: Scent of Blood is able to detect dead and automatons.
**Totem of Fear**: Deal additional damage against enemies influenced by Howl of Terror.
  
2. **Totem of Brotherhood**: Howl of the Pack summons one additional ally to your aid.

  
[font=Georgia]

[color=#00ffff]6. Lunar Transformations

[/color][/font]When the moon shines bright, it's possible to transform into a Werebeast until 5.00 of the following morning. The chance for this to occur depends on the Masser's moon phase and your MCM Settings. To simplify finding a proper balance, there are 3 presets you can choose from:
  
  

  
1. **Warg**: Transformations are spare, Full Moon will always force a transformation
**Skinwalker**: A balanced preset, offering moderate & balanced chances for all moon phases
  
2. **Cursed Blood**: High probability for a transformation almost every night. If you want things to be "difficult" but not "predictable"

[color=#00ffff]7. World Encounters

[/color][/font]![](https://i.imgur.com/6mqpwBo.png)﻿
  
[font=Georgia]*7.1 Spirit Prey*[/font]
  
Spirit Preys are unique Bosses scattered around Skyrims landscape. You can encounter a total of 6 of them and all of them have some unique element to them. Some of them can be a real challenge to overcome putting you into entirely new situations you normally don't encounter, others seem harmless but harmless doesn't mean easy, does it?
  
Not all of them are designed to be beatable when you first encounter them. If you feel like you aren't ready, remember their location and come back to them another time!
  
  
[font=Georgia]*7.2 Werebeast Hunters*[/font]
  
While carrying the Beastblood, you will encounter occasional Silver Hand Patrols looking for their next Trophy (Spoiler: Its you, or so it they think!). They are about as meaningful as the Hunters in DLC1 and about as common too! - With one exception: Silver Hands are now able to drop a rare Book which gives you some clues about where Spirit Prey may be hiding!
  
  
[font=Georgia]

[color=#00ffff]8. Customization

[/color][/font]You can choose the appearance you take on in your Beastform. Simply select the desired Appearance in the MCM and the next time you transform, boom! It's that easy!
  
Please remember though that due to the strict split between Werebears and Werewolves, you won't be able to use a Werebear Skin while you are a Werewolf and vice versa.
  
  
  
[font=Georgia]

[color=#00ffff]9. Miscellaneous

[/color][/font][font=Georgia]*9.1 Becomming a Werebeast*[/font]
  
Werewolves and Werebears have a Chance to drop 'Werebeast Blood'. Drinking it grants you a *free Transformation* and if you weren't a Werebeast before, *turns you* into the appropriate Werebeast. (Werebear Blood turns you into a Werebear)
  
  
I also recommend taking a look at [Alternate Perspective](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50307), which offers you the option to start as a Werewolf right away, including a soft Integration into Nightmare Night to start the Game as a Werebear instead.
  
  
[font=Georgia]*9.2 Ring of Hircine*
  
[/font]As long as Ring of Hircine is in your Inventory, you may Transform an unlimited amount of times per day.
  
  
[font=Georgia]*9.3 Werewolf Loot & Web Destruction*[/font]
  
Its 2021 (I write this a few days before 2022), obviously is that part of the mod!
  
You're also able to completely skip feeding before looting a body by sheathing your claws.
  
  
  

[font=Georgia]10. Compatiblity[/font]

  
* Incompatible with other mods making changes to Werewolves or Werebears
Compatible with [Curse of the Werewolf](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49899)﻿
  

  

[font=Georgia]11. Credits & Thanks[/font]

  
* I'm certain some already realized similarities to [Moonlight Tales](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2803)﻿. I really adore the work that has been put into this mod and it certainly gave me some inspiration to create Nightmare Night in first place. Those similarities are a tribute to it. I did not re-use any of Moonlight Tales's assets.
*[KnErBSE73](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/4147716)﻿* - The Werebear Textures used in Nightmare Night were created by him
  
* Eye Textures from LilyValley's [Werewolf Retexture](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/111669)﻿
Werewolf body and mouth textures originally created by Bellyache, cleaned up and improved by XilaMonstrr ([Link](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68830)﻿), and further edited by Wolflady500 for more variants ([Link](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68840)﻿)
