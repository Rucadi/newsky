# No Numpad Hotkeys and Custom Keybinds
- Author: Naromis
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53390
**NOW WITH SUPPORT FOR SKYRIM v1.6.1130
  
  
No Mod requirements!**
  
  
I just deleted the hotkey mappings (where you can quick-equip your fav spells etc.) on the numpad keys. Also added the option, that you can change the hotkeys in the controls settings. 
  
  
If there is a mod conflict, the other mod will probably overwrite this one completely.
  
You will need to manually merge the controlmap.txt
  
-> I only edited the Hotkey0-8 section, so the rest can be overwritten.
  
  
**Known issues with Controlmap.txt :** 
  
- Changing a Keybinding to 0x00 can cause Problems with other Mods. But I can't even remember why I did that, you can just unbind them via 0xff!
  
- if u enable the option to change the console keybind, there will be two keybind options that are not set initially and will be kinda buggy...i wouldn't use it
  
  
**Installation :**
  
I use MO2 where you add the mod like every other.
  
  
**Manual installation :**
  
Just put the interface folder into the data folder. (I've never done this, so I'm not 100% sure, but it should work like that.)
  
its normaly inside "...\Skyrim Special Edition\Data\Skyrim - Interface.bsa" and should be put like this:
  
"...\Skyrim Special Edition\Data\interface\controls\pc\controlmap.txt"
  
  
**A far as I know these are the [Codes for the Keybinds](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/DIK_KeyCodes)﻿!**
