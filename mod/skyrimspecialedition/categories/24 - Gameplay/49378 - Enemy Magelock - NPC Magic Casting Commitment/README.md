Encourage Skill Based Gameplay by switching the rythm and combat mechanics vs NPCs. When they Cast, they commit to their position, no longer runnning away or adamantly running towards just because they have crazy amounts of magicka due to how they have different regen and scaling stats. This simple mod, allows you to rely on skill more than simply depending on cover or having to min max weapons or cheesing your game or even depending on tgm.
  
  
All done in behaviors so it is scriptless and does not take up any esp or esl slot.
