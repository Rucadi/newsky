Optimised Scripts for SPERG

Version 1.0.1

*Optimised versions (mostly small micro-optimisations, but also important changes to avoid script overload in large load orders) of some of the scripts used by the SPERG - Skyrim Perk Enhancements and Rebalanced Gameplay (SE) mod. Requires the original mod. Does not change any functionality except for improving efficiency.*

  
  
[/color]Requirements
  
- [The original SPERG mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14180). Specifically: version 1.8.
  
- SKSE
  
- [powerofthree's Papyrus Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22854)
  
- [PAPER](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73849)﻿. This is used to replace one OnHit() event by an OnImpact() event in one SPERG script.
  
  
  
Changes made by this patch
  
[color=#ffffff][size=3]- Small micro-optimisations in scripts.
  
- [size=4][size=3]No changes in functionality (aside from possibly some improvements in efficiency). [/size]
  
- Can expect major improvements in certain scripts that were overloading the game's script engine (especially in large load orders).[/size]
  
  
  
Installation
  
- Same as any other standard mod, recommend installing using a Mod Manager.
  
- Note that this is not a full mod, just a patch.
  
- Clean saving should not be required, though to be 100% safe, try to
  
create the saved game for which you first install this file in a quiet
  
place with no combat going on (minimising the chances of any major
  
scripted events being currently active). 
  
- If your game is currently suffering from script overload (e.g., stack dumps in Papyrus logs, and/or noticeably unresponsive scripts), I recommend giving the game a bit of time to process lingering stacks by going into a quiet interior cell and staring at the floor for a minute after installing my scripts.
  
  
  
(In)compatibilities
  
[color=#ffffff][size=3]- [/size][/color][color=#ffffff][size=3]If you have other mods that patch/adjust/change/modify SPERG's scripts, **make sure to load them after and let them overwrite my files in your mod manager**. [/size][/color]
