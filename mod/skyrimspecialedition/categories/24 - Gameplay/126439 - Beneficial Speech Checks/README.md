Made at the suggestion of [Dabiggieboss](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5843790)﻿ ([Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@biggie_boss)), this mod grants you a small buff whenever you pass persuasion (5% reduced shout cooldown) or intimidation checks (5% stronger shouts). Also if you have Experience mod installed, it grants a small amount of XP. Buff is applied after you leave the dialog and lasts 10 minutes.
