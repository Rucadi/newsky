[font=Georgia]SIMPLE HUNTING OVERHAUL
  
[/font]*[font=Georgia]Also known as "Realistic Death Retrieval 2", or [/font][font=Lucida Sans Unicode]RDR2 [/font][font=Georgia]for friends[/font]*

  
**What it is:**- Inspired by RDR2 and Hunterborn
  
- Puts the focus on immersion while staying super lite and player-friendly
  
- Uses the vanilla looting: no extra menus, no bloat, no tedious new systems
  
- Animated via Immersive Interactions / Optional plugins
  
- NPCs react to your hunting if you're visibly carrying an animal carcass. Picking up carcasses is fully optional, so you can ignore this completely too. 
  
- Hunting is encouraged via the trading of carcasses. Shopkeepers that make sense (different per animal type, shop type and personality) might be interested in buying the animals you hunt, with custom reactions.
  
- The more experience you have skinning animals, the less time it takes you (configurable)
  
- Lots of (custom voiced) easter eggs and reactions from the traders/NPCs. 
  
- Easily configurable
  
  
**How it works:**- Looting the pelt of an animal (via the normal looting system) updates the animal visuals, does a super quick fade-to-black effect and plays a skinning sound in the background. This is similar to Headhunter's "Loot the head" system. All very quick, intuitive and unobtrusive.
  
- Looting the pelt also advances time. Depending on your experience in skinning animals, it will take you from a few minutes to a maximum of 2 hours. This happens automatically and a message lets you know how much time has passed.
  
- You can also pick up the carcass of an animal. To do this, you simply hold SHIFT and the animal activation will switch from "Loot Wolf" to "Pick Up Carcass". This is similar to [Read or Take](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69588)'s approach, so you should be familiar with it. Powered via [Dynamic Activation Key](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/96273).
  
- Why would you want to pick up a carcass? See below.
  
  
**The Hunter's Trade:
  
-** Everything in this section is completely optional and you won't see it unless you actively wish to interact with it.
  
- You can sell carcasses for fur and meat to hunters, butchers, innkeepers and those working with fur (blacksmiths for example).
  
- This is done via a dialogue option that shows up and can be selected as long as you are carrying a carcass. 
  
- Prices will vary depending on the utility of the carcass for the given person.
  
- This is all completely voiced and has easter eggs and funny reactions depending on the carcass, the shopkeeper and more.
  
  
**NPC Reactions:**- When carrying carcasses, some NPCs might react around you, with sentences like "Good hunting!", "Good catch!", or "Hello fellow hunter!", etc.
  
- Carrying carcasses in front of guards might have them question you about poaching. Being a Thane or having bought a Hunter's Permit allows you to stay clear of the guards' questioning. Permits can be bought during this interaction.
  
  
  

*You sir, are a fish!*

  
**Requirements:**- [Dynamic Activation Key](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/96273). (Press Shift + E to pick up an animal carcass)
  
  
**Super Strong Recommendations**:
  
- [Carry Your Carcasses](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62628) (SHO version): Without this mod, my mod custom reactions won't make much sense, as they are counting that you have a visible carcass on your person. So even though it's not a requirement per se, you should 100% install it and apply it via IED for the ultimate experience.- **﻿[Immersive Carcass Carrying](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99867)**(SHO Version): CYC makes a whole lot more sense with this one. Get both!!!
  
- [Immersive Hunting Animations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/96961): Dedicated animations for all actions. Read the mod description of the other mod for more info.
  
- **[Skills of the Wild](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37693)**: if you use Campfire, you should give SOTW a look. I've relaunched it for version 2.0 - It no longer edits vanilla records so it's compatible with everything, it's lost its crazy requirements and it's an all-around great mod for immersion players. Get it while it's hot.
  
  
**Compatibility:**
  
- In general, the mod shouldn't mess with anything as it's super lite.
  
- However: the mod edits vanilla in a few, very specific places. It changes some "death item list" from some of the animals covered here. This is done in a couple of ways: it increases meat (instead of one piece, you will find 2 or 3 depending on animal size), it adds pelts to animals that didn't have one in vanilla and it removes the chance of finding Gold or Gems in dead animals. 
  
- What this means for you: place my mod after any mod that edits those death item lists, or alternatively, make a compatibility patch between the mods. Should be easy via the formlists.
  
- Bruma patch available already.
  
  
**How to configure:**
  
  
Spoiler
  
**The default settings are the best (obviously), so you shouldn't need to configure anything. However:**
  
- You can disable the skinned animal look by typing "Set \_RemovePelts to 0"
  
- You can disable the need for a permit by typing "Set \_EnablePermits to 0"
  
- You can disable the time passing + fadeout effect of looting by typing "Set \_FadeTimePass to 0"
  
- You can disable the time passing of looting by typing "Set \_FadeTimePass to 2"
  
- You can disable the fadeout effect of looting by typing "Set \_FadeTimePass to 3"
  
  
For the love of Talos, please notice that there's a space between set and \_

Big thank you to unuroboros for paving the road with [Hunterborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33201)﻿. It's been 10 years of using that mod and I'm thankful for it.
  
Big thank you to [RichWebster](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/1888738) ﻿and [Hanaisse](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/1702646?tab=user+files) ﻿for being awesome and allowing me to use the skinned animal textures here.

**I don't like your mod! I prefer Hunterborn!**Hunterborn is an amazing mod, I love it too but it was hurting my gameplay and making me want to avoid hunting altogether. If you like Hunterborn and you're having fun, then use Hunterborn. Nothing wrong with it. In fact, you can use Hunterborn and still get the voiced commentary, trading and reactions from NPCs thanks to [this addon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99774?tab=description). Enjoy!
