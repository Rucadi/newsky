**[﻿](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58840)﻿Camping Plus Plus**
  
Camping Plus Plus [C++] is an overhaul to the Creation Club Camping addon to give it a new skill tree, buffs you can unlock, and repurpose the chopping block as it's own crafting station!
  
  
**Features**:
  

  
* A new skill tree using [Custom Skills Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41780).
8 unique perks to unlock.
  
* A new relaxing feature you can perform with the first perk in the skill tree. You can spend 30 minutes sitting by the fire to gain the relaxation effect.
New unlockable effects you gain by being near the camp.
  
* An unlockable storage container in the camp.
Perks that let you gain some materials back when breaking a camp.
  
* A new tent variant of the campsite
A portable woodcutting station called the "Timbercraft Station".
  
* Supply Kits that you can use to have a cooking pot, tanning rack, or woodcutting station at the campsite.
The camping supplies recipe is now crafting at a woodcutting station with a slightly more expensive recipe. ([Taken from one of my earlier mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72188)﻿)
  
* You can also craft other wood based objects at a woodcutting/timbercraft station.
A new woodcutting animation using [OAR](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92109)﻿ by [GiraPomba](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/20507499)!
  
* Custom Icons for the items and effects thanks to [Jelidity](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/4569617)!

  
**Perks**: Spoiler
  

  
* Camper (2 Ranks): Able to spend 30 minutes relaxing by the campfire to gain 10/20 Stamina for 2 Hours.
Stasher: Create a storage container when using Camping Supplies with some left over material.
  
* Compact Packing (2 Ranks): Backpacks increase carryweight by an additional 15/30 points.

  
* Disassembler (2 Ranks): Clearing the campsite returns 25%/50% of the materials and you have a 50%/100% chance of getting back supply kits.
Lumberjack: Get an additional firewood when chopping a tree log at a woodchopping block.
  

  

  
* Warm Fire: Health, Magicka, and Stamina regeneration increased by 20% when near a self built campfire while not in combat.
Relaxed Spirit: Relaxing by a campfire also grants an additional 15% Health regeneration for 2 hours.
  
* Revitalist: Restoration spells are 15% stronger and last 20% longer when used near a self built campfire while not in combat.
  
**Skill Tree**:
  
There are 8 unique perks, 11 in total including perk ranks. You gain most of your skill XP by either creating or taking down a camp (12 hour XP cooldown for each) and relaxing (5 hour XP cooldown). You can also gain a small amount of XP when you craft something at a woodcutting/timbercraft station. 
  
  
**Campsite Changes**:
  
The campsite is for the most part the same. You are now able to set up the camp in certain valid interiors. (Can't be in a home, inn, castle, etc) There is a tent variant of the camp as well as supply kits you can make to add more crafting stations to your camp. You can cook at the campfire like normal, or hold down the [DAK key](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/96273) (by default shift) to Relax by the campfire or Ponder and open up the skill tree. If Skyprompt is installed, you can press 1,2, or 3 to Use, Relax, or Ponder at a campfire. The shelter now also uses the [DAK key](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/96273). The default activation prompt is the same, it will open up the menu. If you hold down the DAK key, you will start sleeping without having to go through the menu! You will also get an additional option to open the storage in the menu if you have the perk, in case activating the storage crate is a bit difficult for you.
  
You can get materials back when disassembling a campsite if you have the perks for it.
  
You can also get a storage crate that is located next to the sleeping structure once you unlock the Stasher perk. If you have items in your storage crate and you go to break the camp, they will be returned to your inventory. If you go to make a new camping site while you already have one set up somewhere else with stuff in your storage crate, all those items will be permanently lost. Don't be dumb :)
  
  
**Supply Kits**: 
  
You craft Supply Kits for specific crafting stations. You can make Tanning Rack and Woodcutting Station Supply Kits at a woodcutting station and a Cooking Pot Supply Kit at forges. Setting up a camp while having any of the kits in your inventory will add that crafting station to the camp. You can also activate the shelter/tent while having a kit in your inventory to set up the kit after the campsite is set up. The Disassembler perks now also determine the chance of you getting back the supply kits when breaking down the campsite. 20% chance at base with no perks, 50% chance with Rank 1, and 100% at Rank 2. If vanilla mode is enabled it will also use the same chance as Rank 2, so 100%. 
  
  
**Buffs**: 
  
There are certain buffs you can get through the skill tree. There are two buffs you can get by relaxing at the fire, which last for 20 minutes. There are two that you will have passively while near the campfire of your campsite and not in combat. There is an additional buff if you are wearing a backpack. The buff will work with any backpack mods as long as those backpacks use the body slot 47. SpoilerIt is the slot commonly used for backpacks. If another mod uses a different slot then the buff won't work with it. If a mod adds a non backpack item to that slot it will count as a backpack.
  
  
The relaxation buff has built in compatibility with [jayserpa](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5201727)'s [Stress and Fear](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/116522) using KID. After relaxing you will lose some stress.
  
  
**Woodcutting Station revamp**:
  
The woodcutting station has been given it's own crafting menu. You can use it to craft camping supplies, makeshift utilities, and wood based objects. You can also make a Timbercraft Station at a woodchopping block or at a forge. The Timbercraft Station is a portable woodcutting block. You can use it anywhere and it will open up the woodcutting crafting menu.
  
  
You can craft firewood at the woodcutting station still, but it is limited. Every six hours, you can craft firewood 3 times by "foraging" for nearby wood. This system isn't too in depth, you just get 3 "tokens" when you open a woodcutting station and then those can be used to craft firewood. After 6 in game hours, your supply of the "tokens" will be reset. (The max number of tokens you can have at once is a global value and can be edited through a plugin)
  
Note: If you have the [Woodcutting Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53538) Integration patch, your max tokens will be lowered to 1. Since you can manually harvest trees with it.
  
  
**Vanilla Mode:**
  
Vanilla mode is meant for people who don't want the custom skill tree or aren't using custom skill framework. This disables the skill tree and gives you some of the perks at the beginning of the game. The perks it gives you are Camper (Rank 1), Stasher, Disassembler (Rank 2), and Warm Fire. 
  
Note: It is not recommended to add or remove this plugin mid-save.
  
  
**Campfire Integration**:
  
This integrates Campfire and Camping Plus Plus some what. The campfire from the campsite is replaced with one that works with Campfire's system with a model that is based on CC Camping's campfire model. You can light it, set up a cooking pot, sit, and open skills there. You can also Relax and Ponder at any Campfire fire you place down as long as it is properly lit. Adds all the base campfire field crafting recipes into the woodcutting stations. Disables my mods Tanning Rack Kit and Cooking Pot Kit and edits campfire's tanning rack and cooking pot to use the kit's values and models. The tanning rack from campfire can now be used to set up the camp kit and the cooking pot you set up like a regular campfire cooking pot.
  
  
**Other Integrations**:
  

  
* Huntsman: Some recipes from Huntsman have been added to Woodcutting Stations
Simple Portable Cooking: You can craft the Field Alchemy item and Portable Cooking Pots at Woodcutting Stations
  
* Woodcutting Tweaks: You can chop logs at Camping Plus Plus's woodcutting stations and Foraging max tokens have been reduced to 1

  
**Compatibility**:
  
Not compatible with any mod that edits the same scripts I do or with anything that substantially edits CC Camping. If you have another mod that conflicts with my script edits, make sure my mod overwrites it! Mods that distribute camping supplies to shop keepers are fine and I recommend them! Mesh replacers are also fine!
  
  
Mods that add Map Markers to other worldspaces before would need to edit the script in order to add markers to modded worldspaces. Bruma for example. I created a formlist that will handle modded worldspace map markers. In order to add a campsite map marker to a worldspace, you need to create a new marker in the CK and add it to the formlist using FLM. I have files to add mapmarkers for campsite in Bruma, Wyrmstooth, Vigilant, Siege at Icemoth, and to some vanilla worldspaces that have map addons ([for example](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53878)). The markers will use the Campsite marker if [CoMAP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56123) is installed! Here is an example of how to do it. This is how I do it for the bruma marker addon.
  
  
SpoilerFormList=ccQDRSSE002\_CampingAllowedWorldspaces|BSHeartland
  
FormList=MissileCampingModdedWorldMarkers|MissileCampingBrumaCampMarker
  
  
The new script will work with Go To Bed by default, so load my script after theirs. You still need the edited mesh from their patch, unless you have CC Camping - Comfy Camping, which includes the same changes to the mesh as the Go To Bed Patch.
  
  
The new Tent will work with Go To Bed by default.
  
  
**Customization**:
  
There are a few globals you can change to edit some parts of the mod. You can force enable each of the kits to show up at campsites, which will also disable their recipes. Example: MissileCampingForceTanningRack being set to 1 will make the tanning rack always show up at a campsite and disable the recipe for the Kit.
  
All of the positions for the campsite objects can also tweaked by changing global variables. You can see all of them in game by typing 'help campplace 3' in the console. You can change each value and the next time you set up a camp the changes will take place. NOTE: This is still very tedious and takes a lot of attempts to get something that looks good and fits. I have included an example position editing esp with some custom positions that i think are nice.
  
  
**FAQ**
  
Q: Will this work on 1.6.640?
  
A: Maybe, I used to use it on 640 before I updated, but it might have some issue i might not have run into
  
  
Q: Will you add more variants?
  
A: Unlikely, adding more variants would require
  
  
Q: Will you add more crafting stations to the campsite?
  
A: Probably not. Smithing Anvils, Smelting Pots, Enchanting, etc all feel like too much for a simple camp to have. 
  
  
Q: Can you add being able to just get the camping supplies back when deconstructing a camp.
  
A: No, I feel like getting the whole camp supplies back feels too easy and makes it so you never have to engage with the other systems at all.
