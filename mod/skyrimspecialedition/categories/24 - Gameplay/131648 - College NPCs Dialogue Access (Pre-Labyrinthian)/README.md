# College NPCs Dialogue Access (Pre-Labyrinthian)
- Author: Ixion XVII
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/131648
This mod allows players to talk to College NPCs after the "[Containment](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Containment)" quest and before the quest "[The Staff of Magnus](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Staff_of_Magnus)" in Labyrinthian. This enables players to buy, sell, and train as usual between those questlines.
  
  
They will still have the dialogue (e.g. *"**What are you doing here? You need to get that staff, or else we don't stand a chance!**"**)* but you'll be able to access the normal dialogue options.
  
  
  
  
Compatible with all major College overhauls and additions.
