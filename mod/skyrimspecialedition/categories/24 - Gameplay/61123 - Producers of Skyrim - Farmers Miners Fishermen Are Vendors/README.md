**Description**
  
This mod makes farmers, miners and fishermen of Skyrim vendors.
  

  
* Farmers that buy crops from you in vanilla (except Severio Pelagia, whose produce is being sold by Nimriel, since Severio's voicetype has no vendor dialogues) and Loreius are merchants. They sell their harvest, flour, chicken eggs, milk, cheese and butter, depending on what they have on the farm. They don't sell many items, since they also feed nearby settlements, inns and themselves, and their inventory respawns often anyway. The number of items depends on how many they have on the farm.
﻿Miners that buy ore from you in vanilla, Aienitach and Evul Seloth are merchants (in orcish strongholds blacksmiths take this role). They sell ore from their mine, ingots made from it and may also sell a couple of gems. The number of items depends on how many workers work in the mine.
  
* Fishermen across Skyrim sell fish and some related ingredients.
Farmers, miners, fishermen and hunters won't pay anything to you if you sell something to them, unless you have Merchant perk (they don't resell).
  
* The number of items sold is balanced (i believe).
This mod uses [SPID](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869)﻿, [KID](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55728)﻿, [size=2][powerofthree's Papyrus Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22854)﻿ and [Container Distribution Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120152)﻿/[SkyPatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106659)﻿﻿ in order to avoid conflicts with other mods that other similar mods have.[/size]
  

**Requirements**
  
The mod requires:
  

  
* [Spell Perk Item Distributor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869)﻿
[Keyword Item Distributor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55728)﻿
  
* [powerofthree's Papyrus Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22854)﻿

The optional Orc Stronghold Blacksmiths module has two versions (you can choose in the installer):
  

  
* for [Container Distribution Framework﻿](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120152) [size=2](patch for v1.5.97 is [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120386)﻿)[/size]
for [SkyPatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106659)﻿ (requires **iAllowLeveledListsAddedToContainers=1** in SkyPatcher.ini)
  

[size=3]**Compatibility**
  
  

  
* This mod doesn't edit any vanilla records except for one fisherman reference in the CC Fishing patch and therefore direct conflicts with other mods are very unlikely.
If you have another mod that adds ore from the orc stronghold mines to the stronghold blacksmiths, disable the [size=2]Orc Stronghold Blacksmiths module in the installer.[/size]
  
* An optional integration patch for **CC Fishing** is available in the installer, it makes fishermen sell the new fish.
An optional addon for [Simple Fishing Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/103440)﻿ is [size=2]available in the installer, it makes fishermen also sell some bait.[/size]
  
* A consistency patch for [Trade & Barter](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23081)﻿ is available in the installer, it makes T&B recognize all of the new vendors as merchants of type "Producers" and modify their prices accordingly.
The installer has multiple options for the ore sold by Redbelly Mine to match your mods.
  

[/size]**FAQ**
  
  
**Isn't it useless because i can just take their crops and ores myself?**
  
They also sell other items and you can get more items if you need. But it will be much more useful and immersive if you have mods that prevent you from freely taking their crops and ores, such as [Landscape and Water Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26138) + [Favor Jobs Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40145/).
  
  
**I installed the mod but they are still not vendors**
  
You don't have SPID installed or it doesn't work.
  
  
**I installed the mod and they are vendors but farmers and fishermen don't sell any items**
  
You don't have KID installed or it doesn't work.
  
  
**How do i disable some of the components other than orcish strongholds?**
  
Edit the SPID config (Producers of Skyrim\_DISTR.ini).
  
  
**I wanted to add other items to farmers or fishermen, but it doesn't work**
  
You need to add the new items to the KID config (or create a separate config). I limited the items sold by a custom keyword distributed with KID so they don't sell random food from their pockets.
