# Aetheos' Immersive SmoothCam Preset
- Author: Aetheos
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97730
This preset mod is currently being developed so any feedback on how it feels and about what could be changed is welcome, this mod does also include settings for True Directional Movement, so that I can have the camera track the player while they are moving like how it is in several modern third person games, however TDM is not strictly required.
  
  
Please save your current SmoothCam settings into slots 1-4 as this mod is saved to slot 5 and will override the current settings and load these settings automatically.
  
  
When installing please set it to load after SmoothCam, either using Vortex's Mod Conflicts page or via MO2's Mod Load order.
