**Requirements**
  
  
SKSE64
  
Visual C++ Redistributables 2022
  
Address Library for SKSE Plugins
  
  
**Description**
  
  

  
* Simple SKSE plugin that allows you to grab and throw objects, like Fallout 4.

  

  
* Hold the activation key (E) to grab objects, as normal.
Hold and release weapon draw/sheathe key (R) to throw your object.
  
* The longer you press R, the more force you throw the object with.

  

  
* Thrown objects will damage NPCs on hit. Adjust *fPlayerGrabThrowDamageMult*in configif needed (default damage is quite low)
They also make noise on impact, alerting enemies to the object's location.
  

  

  
* Settings can be configured using *Data/SKSE/Plugins/po3\_GrabAndThrow.ini*
Game settings have been changed to make grabbing more responsive and move faster to point when dragged.
  
  
**Installation**
  
  

  
* Install as normal with a mod manager.
