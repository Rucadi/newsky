# Serious Civil War Fort Commanders

Military Fort Commanders are now more serious! They wear their faction's Officer armor, have a higher level than the other soldiers, and must be killed during "Battle for Fort" quests.
  
  
Features
  
  

  
* All Fort Commanders are now consistently called "Imperial Commander" or "Stormcloak Commander".
All Commanders wear the CWSoldier<x>OfficerOutfit, and will adapt to any replacers which edit that outfit.
  
* All Commanders are now close to double their previous level, and are set to Very Hard in the Leveled Actor modifier. (They will still be comparatively easy, as their max level is now half the player's level, rather than its previous max value of one quarter the player's level)
Added a final objective to "Kill the Fort Commander" in Fort Sieges (CWFortSiegeFort).
  

  
Compatibility
  
  
This mod edits **CWFortSiegeScript**, **CWReinforcementControllerScript** and the Quest Fragments of **CWFortSiegeFort**, and will not be compatible with anything else that edits those scripts. Check for *loose file overwrite* conflicts.
  

  
* **Patch Available** for [Civil War Overhaul - Redux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37906)﻿ in the installer of that mod.
**Not Compatible** with Open Civil War - use [Serious Civil War Defense for OCW](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81557)﻿ instead.
  
* **Load After** my mod [Neutral Civil War Forts Respawn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81523)﻿.

  
Compatible by design with the rest of my ***Serious Civil War***series:
  

  
* [Serious Civil War Finale Sieges](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81548)﻿
*[Serious Civil War Consequences for Jarl Balgruuf](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81554) \**[list]
  
* \* *If you're using this one, I would recommend [Open Civil War](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11076)﻿ and [Serious Civil War Defense for OCW](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81557)﻿ instead of Serious Civil War Fort Commanders.*
