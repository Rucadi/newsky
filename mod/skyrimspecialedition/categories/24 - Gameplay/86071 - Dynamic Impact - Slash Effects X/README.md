Spoiler
  
  
**1.1 Reworked Effects**
  
  
  
**1.0 new. Insect and Ghost.**
  
  
**0.5a Showcase new features. Fist and Arrow.**

  

**Description**
  
This mod modifies the Impact Data Set of the vanilla Skyrim game and adds new impact particle effects.
  
  
  
  
**Features**
  
Over 20 new Effects.
  
Impacts now have unique particles for each skin type: **Flesh**, **Metal Armor**(Dwarven), **Bone, Insect, Ghost**.
  
The weapon types supported in the **1.0** version are All Type.
  
New **spark effect** when hitting objects.
  
Spark effect instead of dust effect when hitting other objects.
  
  
  
  
**Requirements**
  
**None**
  
**Works with all versions of SE,AE and VR.**
  
  
  
  
**Load order**
  
If you don't know much about ESP file data overwriting, I recommend the last priority.
  
My mod follows a completely new file reference path, so if it's overwritten, all the new features won't work.
  
  
Compatible Mods
  
[Improved Weapon Impact EFFECTS Correct Metal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8936) / features are already included. You don't need to install them.
  
﻿[Seriously Improved Sparks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61478) & **Spark mods that modify MPS** / Select the **Vanilla Spark** option in the FOMOD installation step.
  
[Enhanced Blood Textures [A compatibility patch is available in FOMOD]](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2357)﻿
  
[Immersive Sounds - Compendium [A compatibility patch is available in FOMOD]](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/523)﻿
  
  
  
**Incompatible** with mods that modify impact data set.
  
**This incompatibility does not break the game**, but may disable some features depending on the mod load order.
  
Impact(hit) Sound mods / The vanilla sound file replacer will be fine, but the newly added sounds will not work.
  
  
**Recommendations and notes**
  
**All particles are optimized for third-person view**. In first person, it may cover too much of the screen or be awkward.
  
Some of the particles support **ENB particles**.
  
You can get even more accurate results by installing the **Precision** mod.
  
**Slash Effects without Lens and Bloom applied can sometimes look awkward.**
