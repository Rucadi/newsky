**Sure of Stealing**

  
Simple SKSE plugin that prevents accidentally stealing objects while not sneaking. In order to steal objects while not sneaking, activate the target object twice in a row. Applies to all loose objects and containers that are marked "steal". An optional ini setting, [font=Courier New]bChairsAndBenches[/font], can be used to apply the same change to chairs and benches so that sitting also requires double-tapping the activate key.
