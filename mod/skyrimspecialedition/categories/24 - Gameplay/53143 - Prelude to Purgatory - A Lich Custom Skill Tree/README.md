**What is Prelude to Purgatory?**

  
Prelude to Purgatory is an addon for [Undeath - Classical Lichdom](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40802) that provides the player with a brand new custom skill tree. This skill tree comes with 12 new perks, hoping to carve out a unique niche for liches.
  
  
**How does leveling work, and how do I access the Perk Tree?**
  
The answer is, as intuitively as possible. Whenever you capture a soul or have a creature die near you, you gain experience based on its level. You can open the skill tree by pressing "Tab" while in Lich Form.
  
  
**What perks does this add exactly?**
  
**Entry**

  
* **Magicka Weave**
    
  Gain 50 Magicka and 25% Magicka Regeneration, doubled in Lich form.
**Mirror Weave**
  
Your weave protects you against enemy spell casts, granting you 25% Magic Resist, and occasionally retaliating against enemy spells.
  
* **Hardened Weave**
    
  Your weave increases your armor by 150, and converts incoming physical damage to Magicka damage, while the Weave is active.
**Supreme Weave**
  
Gain 50% Magicka Regeneration, doubled in Lich form.
  
* **Transcendence**
    
  Gain 25% more experience in Lich form, your Lich form is no longer hated and feared, and your mortal form can be vampiric.

  
**Necromancer**
  

  
* **Frozen Cadavers**
    
  You may control an additional summoned or reanimated undead. Nearby allied reanimated undead gain 150 Armor and 10% Magic resist, and are empowered when struck by Frost spells.
**One Body**
  
﻿If you would take physical damage, it is first mitigated among your commanded reanimated undead.
  
* **Join the March**
    
  If an enemy would die within 3 seconds of receiving physical damage from an allied reanimated undead, it is revived under that undead's control.

  
**Lich's Powers**
  

  
* **Reconstruct Form**
    
  You are now able to change your Lich's appearance. Necrotic Rejuvination is 200% stronger.
**Wraithform**
  
Grants the "Wraith Form" power in Lich fom. At will, become Ethereal and absorb the essence of fallen creatures, regaining 50 Health, Magicka, and Stamina when a creature dies.
  
* **Peer Beyond**
    
  You see what others cannot, granting you the "Lich Sight" ability.
**Spirit of Midnight**
  
Grants the "Spirit of Midnight" spell. At will, summon a spirit of midnight to aid you in combat until it is slain.

**Requirements and runtimes:**
  
1. Skyrim SE version 1.6.1130+
  
2. [Skyrim Script Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30379)﻿
  
3. [Address Library for SKSE Plugins](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444)﻿
  
4. [Custom Skills Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41780)
  
5. [Undeath Remastered](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6180)
  
6. [Classical Lichdom](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40802)
  
  
**A note on the Address Library:** 
  
This mod needs the *All in one Address Library (Anniversary Edition) version,* regardless of whether or not you have purchased the AE DLC.
  
  
**A note on runtime:** 
  
As stated above, this requires Skyrim SE version 1.6.1130+, sometimes called Skyrim AE. Please do not ask me to support older versions, I don't want to have multiple Skyrim installations.
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
  
This mod is incompatible with any mod that edits any of the following classical lichdom/undeath scripts:
  

  
* **necrolichtransformscript**
**necroreverteffectscript**
  
* **necrouclphylacterysoulscript**

  
This includes my own mod, [Classical Lichdom - Vampiric Lich](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50695). No need to worry though, my werepyre lich loving friend - the perk Reconstruct Form basically does what that mod does. You just need to work for it.
  
Ascension is compatible with my OWN patch, NOT the third party one.
  
  
**Load Order**
  
Load directly after Classical Lichdom. The patch for Ascension should load after, and overwrite the loose files of, Ascension.
