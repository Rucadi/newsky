Background:
  
Vampires are creatures of the night and should see in the dark as well as a human in the day. The default games nightvision is horrible in comparison. It is blurred, monocrome and frankly often makes it harder to see unless stood in extreme darkness. This mod aims to overhaul the nightvision for various 'beings' as well as add new ways for mages and alchemists to achieve something similar. It also adds predator vision, a superior way to hunt down your prey.

The video above is not a mod review, but a description of what the mod does, how to use it etc. It will almost always be more informative than the text on this page. Please watch any videos I place above here before asking any question. Thanks :)
  
  
What this mod does:
  
1. This mod changes the Vampire Sight lesser power in the following ways:
  
  
 i. When you activate the power to the first step you get a clear nightvision with good contrast, vibrant colors (although still with a slight blue tint) and only a very slight blur around the very edges of you vision.
  
  
 ii. When you activate the power again, it moves to Predator Vision. This allows the vampire to see/sense warm blooded creatures (similar to a thermal imaging) even sensing them through walls if close enough.
  
  
 iii. Activating the power once more goes back to normal vision.
  
  
2. A new power is added: Hunters Nightvision. This power just toggles the new nightvision on and off. If the predator vision is active, it will be deactivated when this power is engaged.
  
  
3. A new power is added: Hunters Predator Vision. This power toggles the new Predator Vision on and off. If the nightvision is active when the Predator Vision is engaged, it will be re-engaged once the Predator Vision is toggled off.
  
  
4. Werewolves get the Hunters Nightvision power whilst in Human form. If a werewolf transforms into Beast form whilst Hunters Nightvision is enabled, he/she will transform with Hunters Predator Vision enabled.
  
  
5. Khajiit get the Hunters Nightvision power.
  
  
6. Alchemists can make Night Eye and Predator Vision potions.
  
  
7. Mages can cast Dark Vision and Predator Vision spells.
  
  
Requirements:
  
None. 
  
  
Installation:
  
1. If you have an earlier version installed, uninstall it first!
  
2. Download and Activate with your mod manager OR Download manually and extract the files into your Data folder.
  
3. I highly recommend making a BASH patch as this mod does add things to leveled lists.
  
  
  
Known Issues:
  
1. When using Predator Vision, anyone hit by a spell (or with a magic weapon) that has a shader effect on the target (which is all spells I think), the body seems to 'cool down'. I am trying to find a solution for this, but right now it makes Predator Vision a little strange whilst in combat.
