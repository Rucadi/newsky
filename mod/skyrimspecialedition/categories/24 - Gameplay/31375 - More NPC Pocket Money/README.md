There is now a version 2, which uses SPID: [More NPC Pocket Money 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/104357)﻿! I decided to keep them separate as they work very differently. They're also compatible with each other.
  
  
  
[font=Courier New][color=#cfe2f3]**Description:**[/font]
  
Very simple mod that adds a little bit of pocket money to NPCs. This is in addition to any pocket money they already have in the vanilla game.
  
  
If you want the classic Skyrim version, it's [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/56682). I brought the mod to SSE, properly converted to work with Special Edition (form 44) and given the ESP FE flag so it shouldn't take up a slot in your load order.
  
  
  
It comes in three flavours:
  
**Standard** is how much money I feel the various NPCs might have if they're in a shopping or tavern-hopping mood based on the value of gold in the game. Expected ranges of money involve a few hundred gold for middle-class folk, and up to the low thousands for rich people. I recommend this version if you're using [font=Tahoma]mods like [Your Market Stall](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15814/) or[/font] similar mods where you can act as a merchant.
  
  
**More Money** is roughly double that much (high hundreds for middle-class, possibly in the thousands for rich folk). This is also good for merchant gameplay, but the money they have could be too much for some people. Still, if you want to try selling treasures, enchanted equipment, etc., this may be the flavour that you want.
  
  
**Less Money** is about half of Standard, ranging from just a little bit more than vanilla up to the low hundreds for middle class and high hundreds for rich people. This is the version I recommend if you aren't using mods for selling to NPCs and just want a little more money on your pickpocketing victims or something.
  
  
[font=Tahoma]I actually really made this mod for the [Your Market Stall](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15814/) mod, but this is stand alone and doesn't require that. The problem was there wasn't a lot of people buying any of the more expensive items (like rare armors and gems) because they didn't have enough money, making it sorta meaningless to even display those items in your store.
  
  
This is also ideal for thief-type characters, if you like pickpocketing NPCs in towns for example.[/font]
  
  
The amounts added are pretty random despite the expected ranges I said up there. For example, you might see among middle-class people that one person has 45 gold and the other has 216. A rich person might have 471 gold and another might have 1203. I don't like extremely predictable values so I tried to keep everything fairly random. Mathematically it's possible for them to spawn with 0 additional gold, though highly unlikely.
  
  
This might affect some merchant gold. Maybe. It depends on if they use the pocket money leveled list too (I believe most do not). It might also affect certain containers that use the same pocket money leveled lists that NPCs use.
  
  
This should not affect dungeon chests, bandits, etc., so you won't be getting rich off of a dungeon run without selling your loot off to NPCs.
  
  
  
  
[font=Courier New]**Installation:**[/font]
  
If you use **BAIN (Wrye Bash)**, use the BAIN package and choose one of the flavors in the installer.
  
  
If you use a mod manager (other than Wrye Bash) to install mods, pick one of the flavors and open that with your mod manager.
  
[/color][/font][font=Tahoma]
  
If you manual install, pick one of the flavors and use [7-zip](www.<strong>7</strong>-<strong>zip</strong>.org/) or some other archive extraction program, then extract it into your Data folder.[/font]
  
  
[font=Tahoma]They overwrite each other and are safe to swap around even in mid-game, but you might not notice any changes if you load a save in an area where the NPCs have already spawned.[/font] I recommend installing the mod while you're not inside or even near a town or village.
  
  
  
  
[font=Courier New][color=#c9daf8]**Uninstallation:**[/font]
  
Just deactivate/delete the file. Note that NPCs that have already spawned with the money might not lose that money until they respawn or the area resets.
  
  
  
  
[font=Courier New]**Known Issues:**[/font]
  
NPCs that you've already met might not get the new money until they refresh, which is dependent on your game settings. I believe the default for towns is 10 days. However, named and non-respawning NPCs seem to never reset their inventories. This is a vanilla issue.
  
  
You can force them to reset their inventory via console commands. With the console open, click on the NPC and type "resetinventory". Note that it'll also refresh of any other things they had in inventory, including their clothing, and they'll lose any new items they may have taken since their last inventory refresh (like if they bought something from you).
  
  
It also affects any container that uses the same money loot table as the NPCs, however, so you might be finding a lot of money in some boxes especially in homes.
  
  
No other issues with starting a new game or entering a town for the first time.
  
  
  
  
[font=Courier New]**Compatibility, Load Order, etc.:**[/font]
  
Should be compatible with anything that doesn't remove the vanilla pocket money leveled lists from NPCs. Mods that edit them such as adding or removing other items in the same leveled list are okay. You don't need to rebuild your Bashed Patch for this unless some mod had delev/relev tags on the same leveled list, but that's unlikely since most people don't bother with editing the vanilla leveled lists like that.
  
  
Theoretically it can be loaded anywhere on your load order, as a result.
