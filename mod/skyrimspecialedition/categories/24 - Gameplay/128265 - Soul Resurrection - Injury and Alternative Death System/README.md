**What is Soul Resurrection?****Soul Resurrection** is an alternative death system designed to keep your Skyrim adventure fun, without frustration and interruption. No more frustrating death screens, losing hours of progress, or dealing with corrupted saves. When you die, you'll be revived after a brief moment, allowing you to continue your journey without interruption.
  
  
Accidental deaths no longer have to ruin your experience. With Soul Resurrection, the frustration of losing progress and reloading old saves is a thing of the past. Enjoy your Skyrim journey without the fear of losing progress, and immerse yourself fully in the world of Tamriel.
  
However, death still has its price. Each time you die, you'll suffer injuries that weaken your character, forcing you to adapt your strategies and overcome these new challenges. These injuries gradually heal over time, but the more you die, the harder it becomes to survive.
  
  
But that’s not all. If you fall in battle against guards, instead of dying, they will throw you into jail. After you faced the consequences of your actions—whether it's serving your time or finding a way to escape, you will notice that guards can also steal your gold. Adding an extra layer of challenge as you’ll need to reclaim your lost wealth, possibly through stealthy means.
  
  
The mod comes with a MCM, allowing you to configure the mod to your needs.
