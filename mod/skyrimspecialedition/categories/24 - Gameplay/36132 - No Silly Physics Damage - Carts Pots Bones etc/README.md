With this mod, walking on objects will no longer hurt you.
  
  
  
This mod does not alter telekinesis damage or fall damage. It only removes the damage you get from squeezing a dynamic object (like bones) against a surface (ground or wall) voluntarily or not. Dynamic (trap) rocks still deal damage when they fall/roll on you. You still get damage if you walk on spikes.[/size][/u]
