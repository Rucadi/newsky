**Description**
  
  
A while ago, [this mod, Talking Trains Speechcraft](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85350) was released by glimfeathers and CloudQuest. I really love it and I would heavily recommend it.
  
  
However, it gave me an itch to make my own, more lightweight iteration of it. As such, I started from scratch and I made this mod.
  
This mod gives you a small amount of speech XP for talking to NPCs, using certain select dialogue topics.
  
Currently this applies to certain select topics in Skyrim.esm, Dawnguard.esm, HearthFires.esm and Dragonborn.esm.
  
  
The amount of affected topics (700ish) is too long to mention in the description. However, the topics can mostly be found while visiting a city and talking to NPCs, asking them questions. A notification will pop up telling you: "Your skill in Speech has increased."
  
  
**Customization**
  
  
You can use the following console command to change the amount of XP you get each time.
  
  

```
set ANDR_CRS_EXPGainGlobal_Medium to X
```

  
Where X is the amount of XP. (default value is 50.) Note: while 50 is rather low, the amount of topics affected is rather huge (700ish). I wouldn't want it to get you to level 100 by just talking, but rather provide some extra XP. Feel free to play around with this value though, to see what is best for your personal taste.
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
  
It is advised to load this early in your load order, to let other mods win potential conflicts.
  
  
**FAQ**
  
  
Q: How does this mod, Conversations Raise Speechcraft (CRS) differ from Talking Trains Speechcraft (TTS)?
  
A: AFAIK, TTS gives you speechcraft XP for pressing the activate button while talking to NPCs, whereas CRS adds dialogue scripts that add the XP
  
 as soon as the NPC has said the affected lines. For now, this unfortunately only applies to Vanilla dialogue.
  
  
Q: ESPFE?
  
A: Yes.
  
  
Q: Does installing/updating/uninstalling on an existing save work?
  
A: As far as I know, it should. However, it's good practice to keep a backup save prior to doing this, just in case.
  
  
Q: Is this compatible with <insert mod>?
  
A: I don't know by heart. You might need to check yourself.
  
  
Q: Will you make a patch for <insert mod>?
  
A: Only if it's a mod I use myself or plan on using, I have enough time and I actually like the idea. Otherwise, feel free to do it yourself. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: I have a suggestion to improve the mod. Can you do it?
  
A: Maybe, if I have time and I like the idea, I'll consider it.
  
  
Q: Will you port this to <insert platform>?
  
A: No, I myself only support the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If someone else wants to port it, feel free. (see permission) If you decide to port it, you yourself take full responsibility to offer support to said port. I will not provide no support for any ports by third parties.
  
  
Q: I use a ported version of this mod on <insert platform> and I have a problem. Can you help?
  
A: I don't provide any support for third party ports on other platforms than the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If you have issues, you should adress the person that ported it.
  
  
Q: Does this work on Skyrim 1.6+, aka "Anniversary Edition"?
  
A: Yes, it should.
  
  
Q: Why don't your mods use MCMs and instead use this janky console command system to set globals?
  
A: I am not a fan of MCMs. You can set the globals by making a patch in xEdit. I have no plans of changing this. If you want to add an MCM, feel free. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: Why don't you use FOMODs?
  
A: That would require reuploading the entire mod, in question, even if I only make a small change. My internet is limited and reuploading the files each time will take a huge chunk of my monthly volume.
