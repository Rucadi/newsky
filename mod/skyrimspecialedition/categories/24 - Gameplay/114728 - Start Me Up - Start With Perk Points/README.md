**What does this do?**
  
Very simple mod, allows you to start with perk points when starting a new game or adds perk points to existing saves.
  
Currently there are two versions available. 3 and 5 Perk Points. Select one version, install and done!
  
  
  
**Why?**
  
When starting a new game and beginning at level 1, it can be annoying. You want to roleplay as a Mage, but you run out of magicka quite fast. You are a thief who can't sneak, or a mighty warrior who can't use a sword. No more!
  
  
Start Me Up is here to help you out! Set the pillars of your character with some perk points and lay out your character's path before jumping into action.
  
  
**Install**
  
Install the mod.
  
Done!

2. Load StartMeUp.esp
  
3. Go to Quest and click it
  
4. On the right side you can see the attached script. Open the properties, like shown in the image.
  
5. Edit the Int32 Value, which is 6 and set it to any amount of Perk Points you want.
  
6. Done.
