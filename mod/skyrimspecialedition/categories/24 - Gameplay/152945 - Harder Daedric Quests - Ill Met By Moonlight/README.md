Well met Hunter. This mod tweaks Ill Met By Moonlight quest to be more challenging by increasing stats of both White Stag and Sinding.
  
  
**White Stag**Shorter than regular elk with small increase to health and speed, makes hunting him much more enjoyable. His agility allows him to quickly escape when threatened forcing player to use sneak rather than brute force
  
  
**Sinding**Now uses custom werewolf template rather than using existing vanilla one for werewolf boss, I increased his health and speed also boosting his melee damage by creating custom spell that boosts his unarmed damage. He should have around 2000 health, deal 100 unarmed damage and have double the speed, keep in mind that these values are pretty high since Sinding is not using any armor, meaning that he doesen't have any damage resistance
