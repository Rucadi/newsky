**Swiftly Order Squad - Follower Commands UI**

**Features**
  

  
* Single keypress to open custom menu. ( **' apostrophe by default** )
Make all followers wait and stop waiting.
  
* Make all followers teleport to your current location.
Access the inventories of all followers.
  
* Select which followers are commanded.
Remembers your last selection.
  
* ***Should probably*** work with all followers mods and follower frameworks.
Works with CC Pets.
  
* Stop waiting and teleport works on followers even if they are in another location.
Mouse, keyboard and controller support for the menu. (Press X or LB on controller to move to follower toggle menu, Shift on Keyboard if you don't want to use mouse.)
  
* MCM allows you to set the open/close hotkey, hotkeys for each of the actions and also is an additional way to block specific followers from showing up in the menu.
Long press (Left mouse click, or A on gamepad) on follower to remove them from the menu, you can re-enable them via the MCM.  (This is for weirdly coded followers who are technically "always" your follower.)
  
* Optional integration with [Simply Order Summons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66919)
Added special logic to support inigo's non-standard "WaitingForPlayer" = -1 instead of PlayerTeammate dismissal logic.
  
* For simple mod to enable multiple followers, we recommend [Simple Follower Extension](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58258).
ESL / ESP-FE.
