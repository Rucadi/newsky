# Conditional Fall Damage for NPCs

Requires po3's SPID. Adds a perk to NPCs and creatures that causes them to take no fall damage if they are NOT in combat and NOT in an interior. Does not affect the player or any horses. This is a workaround for a bug where an actor spawns extremely high in a sky and dies suddenly from fall damage. Flagged as an ESL and script free.
