**Fishing Extension for Beyond Skyrim: Bruma**

  
This mod uses [Fishing Extension Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/139626) to expand into Bruma, bringing new fish, new rods, new loot and new ways to fish up random existing Beyond Skyrim misc items while across the border in Cyrodiil.
  
  
**What does this mod do?**
  
  

  
* **New Rods** - Fine Fishing Rod and a named unique variant
**New Unique Artifacts** - found only in Bruma's waterways
  
* **New Fish** - Some food, some ingredients, and mostly cookable. Includes all the necessary keywords and recipes for patchless Survival and Camping compatibility.
**New Map** - Purchasable from vendors *(Ok, this isn't a huge selling point, but I enjoyed making it)*
  

  
The details of what is included have been purposefully not included on the mod page to allow people to find them for themselves, but I have also made a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1atNI13TT7IrAlLGxHSzJQ3CLq4hfjIL_009EDpt8W2Y/edit?usp=sharing) containing all the information, should people wish to browse and find things a little easier.
  
  
**Patches and Addons:**
  
  

  
* **Trout Replacer** - The original Bruma version of the Nibenay Trout is based on the vanilla salmon, so I have also provided a replacer to have them use a standalone edit of [Mihail's Salmon Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/150115)﻿ for consistency with that mod.

  
**Compatibility:**
  
  
Edits to the world are unlikely to conflict with any existing mods, but it will probably need patching for loot and alchemy overhauls and similar mods. I only patch for things I use personally, but anyone is free to make patches for whatever they use and share them.
