**Updated to version 2.0!
  
Recommend a new game when updating!
  
  
Feature**
  
  
When a humanoid NPC dies, other nearby humanoid NPCs will now loots items from dead body.
  
By using the MCM menu, you can set the upper and lower limits of the amount of the item to be looted.
  

  
* Setting the lower limits to 0 gold will allow all items to be looted.
Regardless of the value you set, all hostile NPC gold and ammunition will looted.
  
* It also routes some potions.
Followers do not loot.
  
* It is esp with esl flag.

  
It seemed unfair to me that only the player could unilaterally obtain loot from the dead body after the battle. This is especially true in battles in town. Why don't people try to grab the opportunity to make money in front of them?
  
To solve this, modders are practicing some ideas. For example, NPC equipment is becoming broken, and other things such as stealing from a dead body are criminalized. One of the same interesting methods as these was to have NPCs loot. This is immersive and at the same time reasonable in the harsh nature of Skyrim, where it lives or dies.
  
There are already some mods looted by NPCs, but I created one because it didn't have all of the following elements:
  

  
* Has only the function to loots
NPCs will actively loots
  
* Has an immersive looting animation

  
**Compatibility**
  
  
There are no record conflicts.
  
It may not be compatible with mods that trigger the death of humanoid NPCs.

**Known issues**
  
NPCs may suddenly run away after the battle is over. It will stop moving after a while. It turns out that a package whose FormID starts with the letters FF is temporarily set in an NPC, but I don't know because this MOD doesn't use a package.
  
Please let me know if you know the cause. (But I don't promise a solution)
