***Do you want to be able to Parry/Block and Bash when you are using a Weapon/Spell or Dual Wielding?  Are you frustrated with Toggles, using other mechanics like Sheathing Weapons, or movement buttons in order to get there?  Then this port of Dual Wield Parrying Reimplementation is for you!***
  
  
 
  
**Why should I install this mod?**
  
*Because it's the simplest and best option available.*
  
  
You want a Mod that allows you to set a specific hotkey to block/parry and bash when you use a weapon and spell or when you dual wield weapons.  No weird mechanics and no strange setups.  You push a button and you block/parry.  It doesn't matter if you have a spell or weapon in your offhand and this mod doesn't add any new mechanics to your game.  If that sounds good then you have your answer.
  
  
  
**This looks a lot like that other mod...**
  
*I always planned on uploading this to Nexus.  I was just waiting on permissions.*
  
  
This may look similar to [Key Bindable Dual Wield Blocking and Parrying](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16334) because they are *nearly* identical.  [Aralu115](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/52630526) used my guide [[SJG] Guide for Dual Wield/Spell Blade Parry, Block, Bash mod setup for SSE with Animations (Also QoL for Spell Shield players)](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/81xkbr/sjg_guide_for_dual_wieldspell_blade_parry_block/) to make the mod he uploaded on Nexus.  He simply got his act together sooner than I did and got permissions before I did.  **And honestly I wouldn't have uploaded this mod except he included the*****Attack Cancelling* option in, which is a feature I do not like.**
  
  
Since he decided to include an option I didn't want, I opted to upload this port as I always intended to.  
  
  
  
**Installation***Why can't things be simple...*Oh wait, it is!  After installing make sure to run [FNIS](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3038) to update the animations!  That's it.  The automatic keybind is to "V", but you can remap this to another key in the MCM menu.  
  
  
  
**But I use a Controller Jack!!**
  
*There's a snowflake joke in there somewhere...*

[Controller Key Mapping for Xbox-ONE-PS4 Controllers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18106)﻿
  

  
Both were made to allow users to play with a Controller instead of a Mouse.  They work with this mod, so you're in luck.  Two options are better than one.
  
  
  
**Known Issues**
  
*People got issues.  Mods do too!*
  
  
The Dual Wield animation for bashing makes an attack animation and attack sound, but does the effect and damage of a bash.  This may be jarring for some.  Mechanically it works though.  Animations while using Spells or Staves in your off hand work as expected.  If you know of a good Dual Wield bash animation for SSE let me know!  Also this does not work when you have a spell in your right hand and a weapon in your left hand. You must have the weapon in your right hand and the spell in your left hand.
