Skyrim in one of its earlier patches introduced the Legendary skill system: when an skill reaches 100 you can "reset" that skill to 15, this refunds the spent perk points and you can level up that skill again; effectively you can now infinitely level up, without limit. This mod disables that.
  
  
This does not touch the Dragonborn DLC's perk reset feature which is the reward for completing the DLC and is not related to skill legendary system.
  
  
  
**Compatibility**This mod is compatible with all mods, including mods that change perks or perk trees; or UI overhauls and reskins.
