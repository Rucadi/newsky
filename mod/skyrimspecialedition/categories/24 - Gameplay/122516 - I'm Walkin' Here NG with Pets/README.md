This is an edit of [I'm walkin' here NG](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77394) version 1.7 by [VersuchDrei](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/VersuchDrei/about-me?gameId=1704), which is an edit of [I'm Walkin' Here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27742) by [Fudgyduff](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5687342), which is the SE implementation of [Don't Push Me While I'm Talking](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/79327) for LE by Utopium.
  
If you are not familiar with any of these mods, basically they disable collisions between player and player's allies (marked as teammates)/player's summons/allies' (marked as teammates) summons or during dialogues.
  
  
This particular edit enables pets from [CC Pets](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Pets_of_Skyrim)﻿ (or any actor that is in the PetFramework\_PetFaction faction) for the feature described above without having to mark them as teammates (which would make them a valid target for player enemies).
  
  
While working on this, I also discovered and fixed a bizarre bug that is present in I'm walkin' here NG﻿ 1.7 (not sure about the original mod) which makes the configuration file that comes with the mod purely cosmetic.

Can be installed or uninstalled mid-playthrough without any problem and does not contain any ESP files.
  
  

  
1. Install the latest [Skyrim Script Extender](https://skse.silverlock.org/)﻿ for your version of the game.
Install the latest [Address Library for SKSE Plugins](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444?tab=files)﻿ for your version of the game.
  
2. Install this mod like any other using your mod manager.

  
The mod also comes with the configuration file, options of which are pretty much self-explanatory.

While disabled, there are still small remnants of collisions, which do make movement jittery while being "in" the collideable actor. This is a problem of the original implementation and doesn't bother me enough to try to find some workaround. Some may even like it as it adds some rigidness to actors.
