Inspired by The Elder Scrolls Online's revival mechanics, this mod is an addon to [Soul Resurrection - Injury and Alternative Death System](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/128265?tab=description) by Zzyxzz, granting your character the Soul Restoration power to consume soul gems to heal injuries accrued by the main mod.

This mod also offers some addons to incentivize the use of Soul Restoration, or to make the injury penalty more punishing.
  
  
**Features**
  

  
* Grants the Soul Restoration power to your character at the start of the game or after installing this mod.
Soul Restoration is only usable when sheathed and out of combat, and will check if you have injuries from Soul Resurrection and if you have filled soul gems to meet the cost. The power will do nothing if you don't meet any of these requirements.
  
* The power checks your filled soul gem count, then depletes your stock if you have enough to meet the cost. The cost is based on your player level below, and lower tier soul gems will be consumed first.

* Level 1 - 5: 1 Soul Gem of any tier
Level 6 - 10: 2 Petty Soul Gems or 1 Soul Gem of any higher tier
  
* Level 11 - 15: 3 Petty Soul Gems, 2 Lesser Soul Gems, or 1 Soul Gem of any higher tier
Level 16 - 20: 4 Petty Soul Gems, 3 Lesser Soul Gems, 2 Common Soul Gems, or 1 Soul Gem of any higher tier
  
* Level 25+: 5 Petty Soul Gems, 4 Lesser Soul Gems, 3 Common Soul Gems, 2 Greater Soul Gems, or 1 Grand/Black Soul Gem

* Plays a quick 3 second animation with SFX/VFX, rooting your character as they shatter the soul gems to consume their essence, healing/dispelling any injuries and exhaustion from Soul Resurrection.
Your character gains a debuff after using Soul Restoration successfully that disables the use of the power for 20 minutes, AKA one Skyrim day.
  

**Requirements**

**Install Info**
  

  
* Download Soul Resurrection and all its requirements, then download this mod. FOMOD contains all the addon options below. All addons work alongside each other. Make sure all addons load after the SoulRestoration.esp.

**Addons Available**
  

  
* Soul Resurrection - Longer Injuries: Increases the time it takes for injuries to naturally heal over time. The default time for all injuries to heal naturally is 8 in-game hours. I offer 4 patches to increase it to 24 / 48 / 72 / 1460 in-game hours. This incentivizes the use of Soul Restoration as an in-dungeon option to heal injuries. The Soul Exhaustion temporary debuff is unaffected by this.
Gold Restoration: Adds a lesser power called Gold Restoration, which consumes gold heal your injuries. The equivalent exchange is 200g x Player Level. Listed as an AddOn since its a bit immersion breaking unless you're treating it as offering tribute to the Divines to purge your character's injuries.

**FAQ and Notes**
  

  
* Why soul gems? This mod uses them to avoid any crafting hassle - no more running through dingy Nordic ruins to find thousand year old crusty
    
  paper to convert into bandages. The Dragonborn can already absorb dragon souls to convert them into power - that power can hand wave to absorbing ambient soul energy from soul gems as well.
This mod does not account for under-filled soul gems - use a mod like [Acquistive Soul Gems﻿](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1469)﻿ to remove this unneeded mechanic.
  
* The soul gem that shows up in the animation will always be a common soul gem. This is purely cosmetic and does not effect the actual
    
  functionality of the mod.
When using Soul Restoration, you will lose control of your player while they perform the animation, to prevent interruptions or cancelling out of the animation early.
