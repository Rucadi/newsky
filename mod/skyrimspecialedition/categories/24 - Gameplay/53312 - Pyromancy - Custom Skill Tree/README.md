**What is is this ?**Pyromancy is a mod that adds a custom skill tree made by [meh321](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/2964753)'s [Custom Skill Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41780) where you can specialize your magic on fire based spells. But beware , the more you invest yourself in Pyromancy weaker you frost spells will be...﻿
  
  
You can acces the skill tree by activating the **[Custom Skill Tree] - Pyromancy** item added to your inventory when you first load up the game.

Pyromancy Perk Tree uses regular perk points. So you have to choose between vanilla Destruction Perk Tree or this to invest your perks. And thats where the specialization aspect comes in. You have to sacrifice some of your talents so you can specilize on being a fire magic focused Pyromencer.
  
  
Pyromancy level will be syncronized with your destruction. Your Pyromancy skill level will be same level as your destruction. When you load up the first time and every time your destruction increases , they will be syncronized.
