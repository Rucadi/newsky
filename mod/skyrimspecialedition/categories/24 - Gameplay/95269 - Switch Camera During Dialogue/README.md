**-Switch Cam****era During Dialogue-**

**What this mod does:**
  

  
* Press F (or right thumb in controller) to change perspective (1st/3rd person) during dialogue.

  
**Compatible with... (*no patches needed*)**

  
* Vanilla
Alternate Conversation Camera (And different versions of this mod)
  
* Smooth Camera
Improved Camera SE (Make sure you update to the latest version)
  
* Dialogue Movement Enabler
Joy of Perspective
  

  
**Requirements:**
  

  
* SKSE

  
**The 'why' of this mod:**
  

  
* In vanilla, you can't change perspective during a conversation. If you press "F", nothing happens.
This is annoying, as sometimes an object can get in the way of you and the NPC, or another NPC stops right in the middle, or you need to change perspective for whatever reason, but the only way to do that is to exit the conversation, change perspective, and re-enter the conversation. Well, no more.

**Huge thanks to:**
  
I kidnapped the talented [ArranzCNL](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/70796263) for almost an hour on a Friday evening to help me make this tiny mod compatible with the recently released Improved Camera. I recommend endorsing and voting for "[Improved Camera SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93962)" . It deserves it.
  
  
With IC, you will see your character's body in first person without the bugginess of similar mods. IC comes with a lot of options for those that want to tweak things, but it also works out of the gate for those that just want to install it and play the game. Extra points: Arranz really cares for IC, and this is the best thing possible for such a mod: You're going to see updates and improvements whenever they're needed.

**- ESL flagged?**Yes.
  
  
**- Safe to install mid-game?**Yes.
  
  
**- "Compatible with X?"**Probably. Check the list above. 
  
  
**- Can I change the hotkey?**It's universally known F is used for switching the camera (or right thumb for controllers). If you use something else, I officially declare you a monster and an enemy to all Tamriel. But yes, you can change it easily by typing this into the console: Set SwitchCamera\_Hotkey To X (Where X is the key code taken from the [here](https://wiki.nexusmods.com/index.php/DirectX_Scancodes_And_How_To_Use_Them)). Then save the game and reload.
  
  
**- Performance?**Not a worry. The mod is as light as it comes. When you enter dialogue, the game listens for you to press the F key/the controller equivalent, and if you do, it changes the perspective. It's a single super light function.
  
  
**- Two of your mods in one day? WHAT IS GOING ON!**I'm cooking something a bit bigger than what I usually bring you, and a lot of mods either have to be tweaked, adapted or made from 0 to fit this vision. If you're curious, keep reading below...
