A content restoration mod for Skyrim Special Edition and the official DLCs.
  
  
From the depths of the ether, or just the cutting room floor, comes forth several NPCs, some quests, and other miscellaneous content which was created but never implemented in the game. If ever you had the feeling that Skyrim was missing something, you were probably right! This mod should relieve a bit of that. Villages that were supposed to exist have been brought back. Quests that were partially implemented have been completed. Various items have been restored that were still in the data files. NPCs have been brought back to the game and given homes where appropriate. Plus plenty of other random bits of stuff that was mentioned in the game but didn't exist yet.
  
  
NPCs were implemented using the list available on the UESP: https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Unused\_NPCs
  
Unimplemented quests were seeded by the following list on UESP: https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Unfinished\_Quests
  
Some unimplemented items have been added from the following UESP list: https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Unobtainable\_Items

**Installation Requirements**
  
  
Skyrim Special Edition 1.6.1130 or greater.
  
Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch 4.3.6 or greater.
  
  
DO NOT extract the contents of the BSA file into your Data folder as loose files, or let your mod manager perform an equivalent function on the contents of the file. Doing so will cause things to load in the wrong order and break the game. Skyrim is intended to load a BSA alongside it's ESM/ESP file. Circumventing this causes issues which I will not provide support for. If you insist on going against this advice, you will receive no support for the problems you generate as a result of this.
  
  
**Installation - Wrye Bash BAIN**
  
  
Drop the archive into your Skyrim Special Edition Mods\Bash Installers folder, then install as usual.
  
Make sure the mod is active in the Wrye Bash mods tab.
  
  
**Installation - Nexus Mod Manager**
  
  
Use the "Download with Manager" button on the Cutting Room Floor page at Skyrim Nexus. The installer should take care of things from there.
  
Then simply make sure NMM has the mod activated.
  
  
**Installation - Manual**
  
  
Drop the Cutting Room Floor.esp, Cutting Room Floor.bsa, and Cutting Room Floor - Textures.bsa files into your Data folder.
  
Activate the mod using whatever management tool suits you.
  
  
**Uninstalling**
  
  
Due to the nature of Skyrim mods, especially those with scripts, it is STRONGLY recommended you do not attempt to uninstall this mod once you've begun using it. The scripts altered by the mod, as well as several portions of the content will be permanently altered and will not restore themselves to their previous states.
  
  
This is not a defect in this mod, it is merely how Skyrim works with any mod that includes scripted changes. There is nothing I or anyone else can do about this. You need to load a save prior to having installed this mod in order to restore the game to its previous condition.
  
  
If you insist on removing the mod and continuing with the save though, the Cutting Room Floor.esp, Cutting Room Floor.bsa, and Cutting Room Floor - Textures.bsa files must be removed from your Data folder. Any errors or residual changes left behind by doing so are your sole responsibility and any complaints about this will be ignored.
  
  
**Load Order**
  
  
[LOOT](https://loot.github.io/) should be used for optimal placement.
  
  
**Implemented in This Mod**
