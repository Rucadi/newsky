# Storm the Thalmor Embassy
- Author: Hel

**Notes**
  

  
* Requires new game
**Place this mod under** "Better Quest Objectives", "Skyrim Souls" and "Requiem - general\_NPC\_tweaks" if you use them
  
* Elenwen is disabled since she is needed later in Main Quest
Requiem compatible (order doesn't matter)
  
* You can still complete quest in original way

  
Also, for non-Dragonborn characters, it allows you to go into Embassy before starting "Diplomatic Immunity" (breaks Main Quest) and kill everything inside, including Elenwen.
  
  
By the way, after you get information on Esbern and escape Thalmor Embassy you can skip Delphine in Riverwood and go straight to Riften (vanilla behavior).
