[font=bebas\_neuebook]Vampire abilities[/font]
  
  
Vampirism is a gift in some ways, a curse in others. You gain the following generic Vampire abilities:
  
  

  
* **Champion of the Night:** Your Vampiric charm improves your Illusion spells to work on targets up to **15-40\*** levels higher.[/\*]
**Fierce Hunger:** Able to **Feed** on sleeping or seduced people to sate your Vampiric hunger, or lethally **Drain** them.[/\*]
  
* **Haunted Lakes:** Your Vampiric blood allows you to breathe underwater. While submersed, you are protected from Sunlight.[/\*]
**Nightstalker's Footsteps:** Your Vampiric blood makes you **15-40\***% harder to detect by creatures and people while sneaking.[/\*]
  
* **Resist Disease:** Your Vampiric blood gives you immunity to disease.[/\*]
**Resist Frost:** Your Vampiric blood gives you **50/40/30/20**% resistance to Frost.[/\*]
  
* **Resist Poison:** Your Vampiric blood gives you **100**% resistance to Poison.[/\*]
**Unnatural Strength:** Your Vampiric blood increases movement speed by **10**% and attack damage by **5-30\***%.
  
* **Forsaken:** Your Vampiric curse weakens Divine blessings by **75-25\***%.[/\*]
**Mockery of Life:** Your Vampiric blood makes you **50-25\***% less susceptible to healing spells and effects.[/\*]
  
* **Weakness to Fire:** Your Vampiric blood gives you **20/30/40/50**% weakness to Fire.[/\*]
**Weakness to Sunlight:** Health, Magicka, and Stamina do not recover while in Sunlight and are reduced by **25/50/75/100** points.[/\*]
  

  
*As your Vampiric hunger increases, your Resist Frost grows weaker and Weakness to Fire and Weakness to Sunlight grow stronger. For the meaning of the asterisk next to a value, see "Vampire ranks".*
  
  
Additionally, you gain a racial Vampire ability:
  
  

  
* (Argonian) **Aquatic Predator:** Your Argonian blood allows you to sate your Vampiric hunger by catching docile fish.[/\*]
(Breton) **Dolmen Haunt:** Your Breton heritage allows you to sate your Vampiric hunger by activating a Standing Stone, once a day.[/\*]
  
* (Dark Elf) **Promiscuous:** Your Dark Elven blood copies the racial Vampire ability of the race you prey on. You can have only one at a time.[/\*]
(High Elf) **Pale Gold:** Your High Elven blood slows Vampiric hunger by **50**% and you gain Vampiric ranks **15**% faster, if you are **Sated**.[/\*]
  
* (Imperial) **Connoisseur:** Your Imperial sophistication enables you to bottle a Potion of Blood or Thaumaturgy when you **Drain** a victim.[/\*]
(Khajiit) **Prey Drive:** Your Khajiit fangs enable you to sate your Vampiric hunger by using or consuming Human Flesh or Human Hearts.[/\*]
  
* (Nord) **Preserved Blood:** Your Nord heritage grants **10**% to bottle a Potion of Blood or Thaumaturgy when looting people you killed.[/\*]
(Orc) **Battle Hunger:** Your Orc strength enables you to **Feed** or **Drain** in combat by activating an enemy person who is bleeding out.[/\*]
  
* (Redguard) **Mummified Body:** Your Redguard blood slows Vampiric hunger by **50**% and you gain Vampiric ranks **15**% faster.[/\*]
(Wood Elf) **Blood Hunt:** Your Wood Elven heritage grants **10**% to bottle a Potion of Blood or Thaumaturgy when looting animals you killed.[/\*]
  

  
*Khajiit also have a hidden racial bonus that grants 5% chance to loot a Human Flesh or Human Heart from people you killed.*
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Vampire spells[/font]
  
  
In vanilla Skyrim, your only option for Vampiric blood magic is the underwhelming Vampiric Drain. Sacrilege not only allows it to scale in various ways, but adds three other Vampiric spells that are unlocked through Vampire Lord perks.
  
  

  
* (Novice) **Vampiric Drain:** Absorb **5-30\*** points of Health per second from a living target.[/\*]
(Perk unlock - Apprentice) **Vampiric Seed:** Bone shards pierce a living target, absorbing **1-6\*** Health and dealing **1-6\*** magic damage for **5** seconds.[/\*]
  
* (Perk unlock - Adept) **Vampiric Orb:** Impales living targets in the area, absorbing **2-12\*** Health and dealing **2-12\*** magic damage for **5** seconds.[/\*]
(Perk unlock - Expert) **Vampiric Cloak:** Bats attack living targets for **60** seconds. Absorbs **1-6\*** Health and deals **1-6\*** magic damage per second.[/\*]
  

  
*Vampiric Drain scales strongly into the late game. In addition to scaling with Vampire rank, it is improved by the Hemomancer perk, adding up to 42 absorb per second at 100 Destruction skill. Drain also stuns if dual cast. For the meaning of the asterisk next to a value, see "Vampire ranks".*
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Vampire powers[/font]
  
  
Your Vampiric powers in vanilla Skyrim are 1/day greater powers that merely replicate effects you can already cast at will. Sacrilege improves them by making their effects more unique and changing them to at-will powers, at the cost of increasing your Vampiric hunger by one stage each time they are used.
  
  

  
* (Lost: Hungry) **Vampire's Shroud:** Expend some of your blood to protect yourself against Sunlight for **30-180\*** seconds. Increases Vampiric hunger.[/\*]
(Lost: Famished) **Vampire's Scream:** Living targets within range flee for **10-60\*** seconds and can be seen through walls. Increases Vampiric hunger.[/\*]
  
* (Lost: Blood Starved) **Vampire's Shadow:** Turn into mist, becoming invisible and sneaking **25**% better for **30-180\*** seconds. Increases Vampiric hunger.[/\*]
**Vampire's Seduction:** Bewitches a person up to level **10** for **10-60\*** seconds, calming them and allowing you to feed.[/\*]
  
* **Vampire's Sight:** Improved night vision. Cast again to disable.[/\*]

  
*Vampire's Seduction trivialises feeding in vanilla Skyrim. It is much less effective in Sacrilege, with a low level cap that matches the level of most townsfolk, making it primarily a tool for sating your Vampiric hunger in cities, with racial Vampire abilities and other methods of feeding taking its place in the field. For the meaning of the asterisk next to a value, see "Vampire ranks".*
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Vampiric hunger[/font]
  
  
*Progression:*
  
  
As in vanilla Skyrim, you start as a **Sated** vampire, and Vampiric hunger increases by one stage per in-game day. The **Vampire** ability tracks your current hunger stage.
  
  

  
* **Sated**[/\*]
**Hungry**[/\*]
  
* **Famished**[/\*]
**Blood Starved**[/\*]
  

  
The following effects modify the progression of Vampiric hunger:
  
  

  
* **Vampire rank:** Slows the progression of Vampiric hunger by **0-100\*%**.[/\*]
**Pale Gold (High Elf):** Slows the progression of Vampiric hunger by **100%** when you are Sated.[/\*]
  
* **Mummified Body (Redguard):** Slows the progression of Vampiric hunger by **50%**.[/\*]

  
*To compensate for the Vampire's Seduction nerf making it harder to stay fed than in vanilla Skyrim, hunger progression is slowed down as your Vampire rank increases. For the meaning of the asterisk next to a value, see "Vampire ranks".*
  
  
*Effects:*
  
  
As Vampiric hunger increases, your Resist Frost grows weaker and Weakness to Fire and Weakness to Sunlight grow stronger. Moreover, powers are gradually lost. See "Vampire abilities" and "Vampire powers".
  
  
When you become **Blood Starved**, neutral citizens will attack you on sight (a classic Skyrim feature removed by Dawnguard). Additionally, you will take **1** sun damage per second in Sunlight. Taking sun damage also prevents waiting and fast travelling, so the only ways to prevent the damage are hiding indoors or underwater or an active Vampire's Shroud power.
  
  
*Feeding:*
  
  
To sate your Vampiric hunger, activate a sleeping person or a person affected by the Vampire's Seduction power and choose the **Feed** or **Drain** option. Both options restore your hunger status to **Sated** and heal you (20 + 2\*target level) points (up to level 50). The **Drain** option additionally kills the target, grants Destruction experience and advances your Vampire rank progression by 24 hours.
  
  
*The vanilla feed animation is brittle and breaks easily, especially when feeding on awake targets that are not on the same elevation as you. This is not a bug with Sacrilege.*
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Vampire ranks[/font]
  
  
Vampires become more powerful as they grow older, attaining higher Vampire ranks. The **Vampire** ability tracks your progression towards the next rank in in-game hours. You progress towards your next Vampire rank as follows:
  
  
As a mortal:
  
  

  
* **Time:** Each in-game hour increases Vampire rank progression by **1** hour.[/\*]
**Drain people:** Each victim increases Vampire rank progression by **24** hours.[/\*]
  
* **Consume Potions of Thaumaturgy:** Each potion increases Vampire rank progression by **24** hours.[/\*]

  
The following effects modify the progression of Vampire ranks:
  
  

  
* **Aquatic Predator (Argonian):** Feeding on docile fish increases Vampire rank progression by **2** hours.[/\*]
**Dolmen Haunt (Breton):** Feeding on a standing stone increases Vampire rank progression by **6** hours.[/\*]
  
* **Pale Gold (High Elf):** Each in-game hour increases Vampire rank progression by an additional **0.3** hours if **Sated**.[/\*]
**Prey Drive (Khajiit):** Using or consuming Human Flesh or Human Hearts increases Vampire rank progression by **6** hours.[/\*]
  
* **Mummified Body (Redguard):** Each in-game hour increases Vampire rank progression by an additional **0.15** hours.[/\*]

  
As a Vampire Lord:
  
  

  
* **Time:** Each in-game hour increases Vampire rank progression by an additional **1** hour.[/\*]
**Perform power attack bites:** Each victim increases Vampire rank progression by **24** hours.[/\*]
  
* **Gain Blood Points:** Each Blood Point increases Vampire rank progression by **2** hours.[/\*]

  
The available ranks are as follows:
  
  

  
* **Fledgeling:** Starting rank[/\*]
**Blooded:** 10 days[/\*]
  
* **Mistwalker:** 15 days (total 25 days)[/\*]
**Nightstalker:** 25 days (total 50 days)[/\*]
  
* **Nightlord:** 45 days (total 95 days)[/\*]
**Nightmaster:** 85 days (total 180 days)[/\*]
  

  
Raising your Vampire rank improves many Vampire abilities, spells and powers. This is indicated on the mod page by an asterisk next to a number range. It also slows the progression of Vampiric hunger.
  
  
*Fast travelling and waiting only count as 1 hour, no matter how long the process takes. This prevents certain AFK exploits to rapidly gain Vampire ranks. The higher Vampire ranks are a long term form of progression and are not intended to be able to be rushed. Note that since version 2.0.0, every race has a racial ability that contributes towards Vampire ranks in some form, either directly or by granting Potions of Thaumaturgy or allowing you to Drain more often.*
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Alchemy[/font]
  
  
The following potion recipes are now available:
  
  

  
* (1x Flawless Ruby + 1x Vampire Dust) **Potion of Embracing:** Grants Vampirism unless you are immune to diseases. Vampires heal **100** points of Health.[/\*]
(1x Void Salts + 1x Vampire Dust) **Potion of Hunger:** Increases Vampiric hunger. Vampires heal **100** points of Health.[/\*]
  

  
The Court's Chef perk enables you to create the following potions:
  
  

  
* (2x Human Flesh or 2x Human Heart) **Potion of Blood:** Alleviates Vampiric hunger. Vampires heal **100** points of Health.[/\*]
(1x Human Flesh or 1x Human Heart) **Potion of Viscera:** Advances Vampire Lord perk progression. Vampires heal **100** points of Health.[/\*]
  
* (3x Human Flesh or 3x Human Heart) **Potion of Thaumaturgy:** Increases Vampiric rank progression by **24** hours. Vampires heal **100** points of Health.[/\*]
(10x Human Flesh or 10x Human Heart + 2x Moon Sugar + 2x Fire Salts + 1x Vampire Dust) **Potion of Purging:** Cures Vampirism. Vampires heal **100** points of Health.[/\*]
  

  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Life as a Vampire Lord[/font]
  
  
In vanilla Skyrim, vampire lord spells are universally useful, denying vampire lords a unique identity with strengths and weaknesses. Sacrilege makes them especially powerful at area effect damage, balanced by high Magicka costs and the need to switch into melee stance to replenish Magicka, making them weaker against single targets.
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Basic stats[/font]
  
  
You gain the following effects in vampire lord form:
  
  

  
* Able to loot corpses and containers[/\*]
Carry weight increased by **500** points[/\*]
  
* Take no damage from falls[/\*]
Vampire lord attacks deal **10** (+**1** per character level) base damage (up to level 50)[/\*]
  
* Undead skin grants **50** (+**5** per character level) base armor (up to level 50)[/\*]
Undead skin grants **10**% (+**1**% per character level) magic resistance (up to level 50)[/\*]
  
* Waterwalking[/\*]
Able to feed by performing a melee kill move (power attack bite)[/\*]
  
* Power attacks always stagger targets[/\*]
Regenerate **10**% of maximum Magicka per second (only in melee stance)[/\*]
  
* Regenerate **5**% of maximum Stamina per second (only in caster stance)[/\*]
**Bloodthirst:** Vampire lord claws do **5-30\*** points of bleed damage, healing you for the same amount.[/\*]
  
* **Feast:** Killing a person with a melee kill move (power attack bite) restores **200** points of Health.[/\*]

  
Note that Magicka only regenerates in melee stance and Stamina only regenerates in caster stance, creating an incentive to "stance dance".
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Scaling and experience gain[/font]
  
  
A major drawback of vampire lords in vanilla Skyrim is their lack of skill scaling and inability to gain experience. In Sacrilege, vampire lords scale with your Destruction skill:
  
  

  
* In vampire lord form, gain +**0.25** damage per level of Destruction, and +**1.5** armor per level of Destruction (up to level 100).[/\*]
In vampire lord form, use the Raze, Vampiric Grip or Gutwrench spell in caster stance, attack in melee stance or perform a melee kill move (power attack bite) to gain experience in Destruction.[/\*]
  
* In vampire lord form, use the Conjure Gargoyle spell in caster stance to gain experience in Conjuration.[/\*]
In vampire lord form, use the Vampiric Grip or Maelstrom spell in caster stance to gain experience in Alteration.[/\*]
  
* In mortal form, **Drain** a victim to gain experience in Destruction.[/\*]
In both forms, damaging Vampiric blood spells are considered Destruction spells for the purpose of Destruction perks.[/\*]
  

  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Vampire Lord spells (Blood Magic)[/font]
  
  
Similar to vanilla Skyrim, but with a stronger focus on damage instead of disabling effects.
  
  

  
* **Raze:** Cuts through living targets in a line, absorbing **10-60\*** Health and dealing **10-60\*** magic damage. *(Magicka: 50)*[/\*]
**Conjure Gargoyle:** Vampiric power summons a Gargoyle for **60-360\*** seconds. *(Magicka: 100)*[/\*]
  
* (Perk unlock) **Gutwrench:** Absorb **5-30\*** Health per second from nearby living targets. After **1** second per **25** Health, they explode. *(Magicka: 25/sec)*[/\*]
(Perk unlock) **Vampiric Grip:** Pulls a living target to you, absorbing **10-60\*** Health and Stamina per second at close range. *(Magicka: 50/sec)*[/\*]
  
* (Perk unlock) **Maelstrom:** Vortex pulls targets within range to the center, inflicting **50**% weakness to magic for **3** seconds. *(Magicka: 200)*[/\*]

  
*Gutwrench affects a 20 foot area around yourself as you concentrate. The secondary effect causes it to build up 25 points of tension per second as you keep it on enemies for a prolonged period of time, ultimately tearing them apart when this tension exceeds their remaining Health. Built up tension is reset when they leave the radius.*
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Vampire Lord powers (Night Powers)[/font]
  
  
Similar to vanilla Skyrim, but with a stronger focus on crowd control.
  
  

  
* **Bats:** Transform into a swarm of bats and dash a short distance. *(2 uses, 20 second cooldown, Magicka: 25)*[/\*]
**Echo Scream:** Sends out a quick pulse that detects all creatures. *(Magicka: 15)*[/\*]
  
* (Perk unlock) **Mist Form:** Turn into invisible and invulnerable mist for **10** seconds, regenerating **10** Health, Magicka and Stamina per second. *(1 use, 60 second cooldown, Magicka: 100)*[/\*]

* (Perk unlock) **Tremor:** Shake the earth, staggering nearby targets and throwing them into the air. *(2 uses, 30 second cooldown, Magicka: 100)*[/\*]

  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Vampire Lord perks[/font]
  
  
Sacrilege expands the Vampire Lord perk tree from 11 to 24 perks.
  
  
As in vanilla Skyrim, absorb lifeblood to progress towards the next Vampire Lord perk point. It takes **2** lifeblood absorptions to gain your first perk point, increased by **1** for each further perk point (down from **2** in vanilla Skyrim to compensate for the increased number of perks).
  
  

  
* **Killing victims with Raze or Gutwrench:** Each victim grants lifeblood.[/\*]
**Performing power attack bites:** Each victim grants lifeblood.[/\*]
  
* **Consume Potions of Viscera:** Each potion grants lifeblood.[/\*]

Sacrilege is part of a cycle of vanilla-plus gameplay overhauls that combine to form "V++ Enairim", designed to improve existing game systems without drastically changing the game:

[font=bebas\_neuebook]Installation[/font]
  
  
**Installation procedure:** Add the mod to your load order and activate it. Make sure you are not currently a vampire. An error message will be shown if another mod is overwriting key Sacrilege scripts.
  
  
**Uninstallation procedure:** Remove the mod. Any perk points in vampire lord perks that have no vanilla equivalent will be lost.
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]FAQ[/font]
  
  

  
* **What is the difference between this and Sacrosanct:** Sacrilege has fewer features than Sacrosanct, but is more compact and as a result, more balanced. Moreover, Sacrilege focusses more on the drawbacks of Vampiric existence, while Sacrosanct allows you to grow out of them more easily.[/\*]
**Does this mod add vampire hunters:** No, this is out of scope for a V++ vampire mod. The mod already features enough drawbacks for vampirism.[/\*]
