**Installation**
  

  
* Safe to install at any point

  
* Uninstalling midgame is not recommended

  
* ESL Flagged

  
**Compatibility**
  

  
* [Instant Mining and Wood Chopping](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55096)﻿ - **Compatible**

  
* [Ars metallica](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/321)﻿ - **Compatible**

  
* [Andrealphus' Jobs Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/109363)﻿**-** **Compatible and integrated (Check its page)**
[Oblivion Interaction Icons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52743?tab=description)﻿ - **Compatible ([patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/159603?tab=description)﻿)**
  

  
* Any other mod that doesn't alter/add MineOreXXX Activators or overwrites DLC2\_QF\_DLC2TTR2\_0201C06E script  -**Compatible**

  
* This mod alters LItemGems10 and DLC2ExpSpiderLItemGemXXXXFlawless leveled lists; I recommend loading deepborn.esp after any loot overhaul

  
**Notes**
  
  

  
* Tree uses vanilla perk points

  
* Hitting provides less experience than activating the veins for balancing reasons

  
* There's a **15 seconds cooldown** for experience earning when activating ores

  
* I highly recommend using [Locked Vein Activation Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/151387)﻿ along this mod

  
* **Commision Expert** perk affects [Mining Radiant Quests](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Mine_Ore)﻿ and ["Heart Stones" Quest](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Heart_Stones)﻿ rewards

  
* Majority of ores are considered **extractable**, with the exception of **dwarven**, **amber**, **madness****and heart stones**

  
* **Deep Echo** employs **3D sound cues**

  
* **[size=3][b][color=#e06666]Deep Echo** [/color][/b]detects veins, **not their depletion state**[/size]
