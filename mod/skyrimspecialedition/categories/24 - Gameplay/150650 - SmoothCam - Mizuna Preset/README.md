Q. There are so many high quality smooth cam presets out there. Why use this one?
  
A:Preference. Give it a try.
  
  
I like exploring. I like walking around and looking around.
  
I like looking at my character.
  
  
But then [Sanguine Symphony](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/148388) was released and combat became a lot of fun.
  
Then I started to worry about the camerawork, so I decided to make one from scratch.
  
  
When not in combat, I move the camera closer to make it easier to explore.
  
When in combat, I move the camera farther away to improve visibility.
  
It should be easier to fight enemies that move at high speed, or giants and dragons.
  
  
Also, I don't like excessive camera lag, so I tried to keep it as low as possible.
  
I can't think of any games with similar camerawork, so give it a try! !
  
If you don't like it, just delete it.
  
  
\*I am currently adjusting the settings of combat-related mods.
  
I recommend downloading the setting files for Gore Enhanced Settings - Sanguine Symphony and True Directional Movement along with this preset.
  
I plan to release the adjusted Precision and BodyColision soon.

***Notes***
  
I was unable to test Dragon Riding, Werewolf, and Vampire Lord on my Skyrim,
  
so I have made some changes but have not confirmed them.
  
Just adjust these to your liking.

This is a quick video. There is a huge difference between playing the game and actually playing it, so I would be happy if you could try it out without judging it based on the video alone.
