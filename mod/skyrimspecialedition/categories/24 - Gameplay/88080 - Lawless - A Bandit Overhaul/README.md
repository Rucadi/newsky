[size=4]**Lawless - A Bandit Overhaul**

  
  
Lawless is intended to be a complete overhaul of bandit enemies in Skyrim and Solstheim. This mod introduces 13 new bandit archetypes inspired by previous TES titles, all with unique strengths and weaknesses, as well as additional tiers for bandit spawns, leading to more diverse and powerful enemies throughout the game. All bandits have received stat and perk adjustments that fit their respective roles as enemies.
  
  
**Bandit Scaling System:**
  
  
In the vanilla game, there are only 6 tiers of bandits, meaning that the highest level bandit you will ever encounter can only reach level 25 for normal bandits and 28 for bosses. I wanted to allow bandits to continue to scale with the player throughout a playthrough, so that they will always represent a reasonable challenge rather than an afterthought.
  
  
To accompany these higher levels and stats, bandits actually receive proper perk support, now. In vanilla, bandits were lucky to get more than a handful of perks for their skills. Lawless ensures that bandits have access to all perks that are appropriate to their class, as long as that perk will not be useless or actively detrimental to the game experience. The flat "bonus x% damage" perks that were added to bandits as compensation for not having actual perks have been removed, allowing for bandits with higher damage and survival that also present these strengths in unique manners.
  
  
The new tiering system, as well as the stats for each tier, are as follows:

**Item Changes and Additions:**
  
  
The equipment used by bandits has been adjusted to make room for these new variants and additional scaling tiers. 
  
  
Of particular note is the equipment for light armor bosses, as these variants don’t exist in Vanilla. While heavy armor bandit bosses received an additional level of scaling through the Nordic Carved Armor from Dragonborn, the closest matching set for light armor just…doesn’t exist. Elven Gilded equipment was never fully implemented, and, to be honest, wouldn’t fit the aesthetic for a bandit boss in Skyrim, in my opinion. However, thanks to the work of the ever-talented [Dareni](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/5073294), we can use the gorgeous [Nordic Leather Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59296) as our final armor tier. 
  
  
Given that bandit bosses scale to significantly higher levels now, I felt that further progression in their weaponry was warranted. In Vanilla, the highest tier of weapon a bandit boss can use is Ebony at level 36; I added the chance for enchanted Ebony weapons at level 46. Nothing higher than that; don’t worry, you won’t find bandits wearing glass/ebony/daedric/dragon equipment nor wielding daedric/dragon weapons.
  
Spoiler
  

  
* Non-boss light armor bandits in Skyrim wear up to Scaled tier armor and can wield up to Elven tier weapons.
Non-boss heavy armor bandits in Skyrim wear up to Steel Plate tier armor and can wield up to Elven tier weapons.
  
* Boss light armor bandits in Skyrim wear up to Nordic Leather tier armor and can wield up to enchanted Ebony tier weapons.
Boss heavy armor bandits in Skyrim wear up to Nordic Carved tier armor and can wield up to enchanted Ebony tier weapons.
  
  
Solstheim bandits have received some changes to their gear distribution in order to make full use of Dragonborn specific armors and styles.
  
Spoiler
  

  
* Non-boss light armor bandits have access to Hide > Studded/Fur > Leather > Light Chitin > Scaled armor based on player and enemy level, and replace Elven weapons with Nordic
Non-boss heavy armor bandits have access to Iron > Bonemold > Heavy Chitin armor based on player and enemy level, and replace Elven weapons with Nordic
  
* Boss light armor bandits follow a progression system of Leather > Light Chitin > Scaled > Nordic Leather armor based on player and enemy level, and can wield up to enchanted Ebony tier weapons
Boss heavy armor bandits follow a progression system of Bonemold > Heavy Chitin > Nordic Carved armor based on player and enemy level, and can wield up to enchanted Ebony tier weapons
  
* These changes end with bandits in Solstheim having a minimal amount of additional armor rating over those in Skyrim, while allowing for a unique aesthetic
Stahlrim armor has been removed from boss bandit armor pools to be more in keeping with game lore
  
  
Bandit bosses have a relatively unique niche for the player as good opportunities to find enchanted weapons in the base game. As I have added bosses that don’t use traditional weapons (Brawlers/Monks, Sorcerers, Spellswords with bound weapons), I have instead opted to give these bosses a chance to wear enchanted jewelry specific to their skills. Enchanted jewelry in the wild is rather uncommon in comparison to armor and weapons, so this change should be a good way for players to encounter more on their journey, and also serves as a slight power increase to the bosses themselves.
  
  
Some enemies use unique equipment combinations solely meant for a little bit of added flavor. A few examples include:
  
Spoiler
  

  
* Battlemages and Spellswords wear mage hoods instead of armored helmets
Redguard bandits that use onehanded weapons replace Elven Swords with Scimitars, and Redguard bosses have a chance to carry unique enchanted Scimitars instead of enchanted Elven Swords
  
* Thief-oriented bandits can drop poisons and sneaking tools such as lockpicks upon defeat
  
Bandit gold has also been adjusted. Given that bandits now scale to basically double from vanilla, I wanted to ensure that monetary rewards also continued to improve as you leveled up. The highest amount of gold available from non-boss bandits has been increased from 125 at level 24 to 250 at level 50. However, the vanilla system of randomization remains, so even at level 50, you can find anywhere between 25 to 250 on a non-boss bandit. The highest amount of gold available from boss bandits has been increased from 250 at level 21 to 400 at level 55. The overall scaling curve has been adjusted, meaning a slight decrease in maximum gold at each level tier to account for a higher ceiling. I have also implemented the randomization system for these values, so you will no longer have every single bandit boss drop 250 gold after a certain level, and you can now find anywhere from 50 to 400 gold on a boss bandit. These changes work out to a higher overall gold income for the player, with the caveat that the gold is no longer heavily concentrated on just the boss of an area, and you are instead rewarded more for dispatching non-boss enemies.
  
**NPC Consistency Specifics**
  
  
With the introduction of all of these new types of enemies, unique classes, combat styles, and equipment need to be properly distributed to enemies. In order for certain classes to function properly and behave as designed, they need to inherit certain template flags, specifically AI data. In the majority of cases, a leveled NPC is placed in a location, they inherit all of the proper flags from their template to make my changes function correctly, and everything works out great. However, there are situations where that is not the case. 
  
  
In order to adjust for certain placed NPCs that follow different AI conventions for one reason or another (initially not hostile, warning aggro radius, involved with a different faction, etc etc) individual NPC record edits need to be made. I have tried to use as light of a hand as I can, but in order to provide the most comprehensive experience for users possible, there will be edits made to a large amount of individual bandit-associated NPC records, including enemy placement within certain dungeons. There is no way to avoid these additional edits while also providing proper consistency and variety within bandits. I will work to provide patches where possible, and welcome feedback on mods that users would consider high priority for consistency and compatibility patches.
  
  
**Addons**
  
  
In an attempt to provide a customizable experience that is approachable for as many users as possible, I have separated additional functionality into a handful of addons designed to allow players to choose what best fits their needs.
  
  
**Simonrim Addon** (Requires Mysticism, Adamant, Hand to Hand, and Thaumaturgy)
  

  
* Three additional enemy classes (Brawler, Healer, Monk)
Distributes a comprehensive suite of perks, spells, and new enchantments to enemies as is appropriate
  
* Some stand-outs include:
    
  [list]
Significantly expanded spell pool for all casters
  
* New bound weapon types for Spellswords
Poison spells for certain hybrid characters and the Healer archetype
  
* Unique heal over time spells and alteration debuffs
Vastly expanded enchantment pool for boss weapons and jewelry
  

[/list]
  
**Expanded Enemy Coverage**

  
* While the original file makes changes to bandit and bandit-associated NPC records to ensure consistency, this file is designed to offer additional coverage to NPCs that may be more tangentially related to bandits or draw from bandit lists in a roundabout way
Enemies addressed through this file include:
  

Spoiler

  
[list]
  
* Hunters of Hircine
Afflicted
  
* Boethiah Cultists
Morag Tong
  
* Thirsk Hall Nords
Soul Cairn humanoid spirits
  
* Ghosts that draw from bandit lists
Alik’r
  
* Southfringe Sanctum spellswords
Sailors
  
* Pirates
World Encounter hostile adventurers
  
* World Encounter assassins
World Encounter thieves
  

[/list]
  
  
**Leveled List Difficulty**[/size]

  
* In the vanilla game, bandit spawns select what enemy to spawn between the highest leveled version appropriate to the spawn difficulty and all levels lower than that version
These addons simply change it so that bandit spawns only choose the highest leveled version appropriate to the spawn difficulty
  
* As an example: If you are level 9 and a bandit spawn point has a difficulty of 1.0, the vanilla game would select any bandits from level 9, 5, or 1 lists. With these addons, you will only encounter bandits from the level 9 list
This is an extremely minimal change that will bring a significant amount of difficulty, especially when facing large groups
  

  
**Additional Spawns (WIP)**

  
* Handplaces additional bandits within bandit camps
Large increase in bandit variety
  
* Be warned that this ranges from a reasonable additional challenge to an *extreme* increase in difficulty in some situations

  
[Lawless Bruma](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/91305)

  
* ﻿Implements all of Lawless' bandit overhaul for Beyond Skyrim - Bruma

  
**Compatibility and Conflicts**
  
  
This mod is intended to be an all-encompassing overhaul for bandits, which includes their stats, perks, spells, behavior, and equipment. Lawless is not designed to be used alongside any other bandit overhauls.
  
  
Make sure to load this after mods that adjust combat style records, such as Blade and Blunt, to ensure that Lawless' changes take priority.
  
  
Given the high quantity of vanilla records adjusted, combined with an extreme amount of additional records, conflict and inconsistency between other mods are bound to occur. I will provide patches for mods that I use and know need conflict and consistency resolution, and those already brought to my attention. If additional patching is required for mods I am not aware of, I will do my best to provide them. I encourage users to attempt patching for themselves, and will be hosting additional patches provided by individuals whose skills I trust.
  
  
Facegen files are included and were necessary to regenerate with all the changes being done to templates and individual records. If you're using mods that provide different facegen for bandits, I would suggest loading those after Lawless.
  
**Available Patches**
  
  
As the patches for Lawless are now contained within a FOMOD installer, I wanted to provide a general list of available patches for easy viewing to determine if you may need a patch for your load order. This is simply an exhaustive list of patches currently available; specific details about what each patch does are included in the FOMOD installer.

**Installation**
