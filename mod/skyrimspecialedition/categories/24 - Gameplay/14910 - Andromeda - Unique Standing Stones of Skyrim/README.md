FAQ
  
  
**Installation instructions:** Make sure you do not have the Atronach or Steed Stone active, then add the mod to your load order and activate it.
  
  
**Uninstallation instructions:** Select the Mage, Warrior or Thief Stone, then deactivate the mod and remove it from your load order.
  
  

* **The Steed Stone is still vanilla:** If you use Nexus Mod Manager, make sure you have a recent version so it knows to load Andromeda below Survival Mode.[/\*]
**I uninstalled this mod while the Lover Stone was active and now I can't die:** I'm sorry. Reload an older save.[/\*]
