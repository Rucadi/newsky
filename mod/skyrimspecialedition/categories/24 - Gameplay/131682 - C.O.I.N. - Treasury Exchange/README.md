 ﻿The Silver Blood family, as of late, has realized the potential in much of the scrap coinage lying around in Skyrim's dungeons, and they have hired a Vaserio Artellian to manage a coin trade in program. Trade in your scrap dungeon coins for real usable currency at the Treasury House.

Treasury Exchange is *technically* compatible with my former exchange mod, [Merchant Exchange](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70644), **but** they serve a similar purpose.
  
  
Treasury Exchange was meant to be used in place of Merchant Exchange, and paired with the other COIN exchange mods by [TateTaylorOH](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/TateTaylorOH/mods) such as [Morrowind Mint](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/129387), [Elven Supremacy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/129717), [Gibberish](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/127871), and [Skyrim Silver](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/127897)
  
  
Some mods (some, but not all) that overhaul the interior of the Treasury House might need a patch. Most lighting mods should be fine as long as you load them after Treasury Exchange.
