[left]﻿Tired of having sex with NPCs but not being able to talk to them? Want to ask Lydia about her duties to the Thane while in the middle of it?[/left]Having sex but still want to receive quests, train, shop, or just chat during the act?
  
This mod is for you!
  
  
This could be even better if modders create custom dialogue for NPCs during sex, bringing an immersive experience to the next level.

The MCM configurations include:
  
  
  

  
* **Hotkey To Trigger Dialogue**: Hotkey to trigger dialogue in the player's Ostim scene. It only works when you are in an Ostim scene. If you are not using a hotkey, press the Esc key to cancel keybinding.

  

  
* **Only same-scene actors**: Only enable dialogue for actors in the same scene. If disabled, you can talk to all NPCs within a 1.5 meter radius.

  
  
Requirement
  
  
OStim Standalone **( version 7.3.4 or higher )**
  
SkyUI 
  
UIExtensions
  
  
  
Installing
  
  
Safe to install mid game.
  
  
  
  
Upgrading
  
  
Okay, for those who are using version 1 and are preparing to update to version 1.1:
  
  
You will need to update on a clean save (meaning a save that hasn’t had this mod installed before) or start the new game. You can also clean an existing save to update without causing errors. You can do this just like how you updated OStim. If you’re not sure how to clean a save file, the method is mentioned in the description of the Ostim Standalone mod under the 'Upgrading' section; just follow the same procedure for this mod.
  
  
  
  
For Modders
  
  
For modders who want to create mods that add custom dialogues during OStim scenes, I have added factions in this mod that will be assigned to actors during OStim scenes. You can use these factions as conditions to ensure that the dialogues only occur during an OStim scene.
  
  

  
* **OTDSActorInOstim**: This faction will be assigned to actors at the start of an OStim scene and will be removed when the scene ends.
**OTDSActorSex**: This faction will be assigned to actors when they are actively engaging in sex (excluding scenes like kissing, hugging, dancing, etc.) and will be removed when the sex scene ends.
  
  

  
Here is an example of how to use it: GetInFaction Faction:'OTDSActorInOstim' == 1.00
  
  
Basically, this is an addition to make creating dialogues easier. It’s optional, not mandatory. You can implement your own approach without needing to use this.
  
  
  
  
Compatibility
  
  
Everything.
  
  
  
  
FAQ
  
  
ESP-FE?
  
Of course.
  
  
Subtitles do not work in third-person view.
  
I'm not sure whether this is caused by OStim preventing subtitles from appearing or if Skyrim itself blocks them in freecam mode.
  
I have no solution for this and even doubt if it can be fixed at all if it's a limitation of Skyrim itself. So for now, there's no fix. You can still use first-person view, where subtitles will work fine.
