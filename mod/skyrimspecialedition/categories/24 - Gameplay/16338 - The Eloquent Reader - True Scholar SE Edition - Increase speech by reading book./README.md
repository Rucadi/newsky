The Eloquent Reader - True Scholar SE Edition

  
  
Introduction
  
This mod is a conversion of the mod True Scolars made by [Daiyus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/1414344), I used Skyrim LE version since a long time and miss it a lot in SE.
  
Daiyus choose a very light and smart solution which doesn't need the use of any patches so every book are supported.
  
  
How it works
  
For every new book you read you will gain a flat amount of experience towards leveling up your Speech skill.
  
The mod will remember exactly which books you have read, and will make sure you only gain experience whenever you read a new title, no matter where you find it. Buy a book from a store and read it, then a find a new copy in some dungeon somewhere, and when you read that it will know that you’ve read that book before and not give any further bonus.
  
  
And that’s pretty much it for what this mod does. It’s very small, and streamlined, but I hope that some of you will enjoy using it.
  
  
3 versions :
  
**Main** gives you 500 XP by book
  
**Medium XP** gives you 255 XP by book (recommended if you like to read book but not too much and use mod like notice board)
  
**Less XP** gives you 100 XP by book (recommended if you like to read everything and use mods which add books & notes, like the Notice board and The Legacy of the Dragonborn)
  
  
Installation
  
Drop as usual, place it where you want, no vanilla record edited, no conflict so load order is not a matter.
  
Optional version (Medium XP and Less XP) need to be installed after the main version. Overwrite or merge when asked.
  
  
Recommended
  
[Pick up books - Simple SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2453?tab=description) is a very good companion for this mod.
  
  
Requirement
  
This mod requires SKSE64 nothing else. It should be compatible with any update.
  
  
Incompatibility
  
Mods which play with the Book read game stat could lead to a bug which permits to gain XP multiple times from same book.
