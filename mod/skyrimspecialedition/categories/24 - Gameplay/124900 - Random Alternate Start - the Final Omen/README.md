\*This is a reworked edition of previous alternate start location mods.
  
 The major improvement is that you start whenever you want.
  
There's no waiting around and no pressure.
  
You can also use a magic spell to pick up the main quest.
  
  
Plus, I think it's **fun as hell** to jump into the clouds and land in Skyrim.

DESCRIPTION:**
  
Choose your starting gear, set up all your mods, then cast yourself into the Skyrim universe. You might end on top of a mountain, inside a cave or in dangerous territory where you must fight to survive.  With a multitude of starting locations and a variety of starting gear, you can have a different experience each time.
  
  
The greatest difference from previous random start mods is that you do not need to select a waiting period. 
  
Instead of being transported at a fixed time, you can dive in whenever you want.
  
(If you use Spell Research, or any mod that needs time, this is definitely your baby.)
  
  
**MAIN FEATURES:**
  

  
* **476** Starting locations in **Skyrim**
19 more in **Blackreach**
  
* Choose gear and spells [**new Helgen Teleport** spell!]
Freely **save**your outfitted character
  
* Enter Skyrim only when you're ready
Sweet-looking chargen room
  
* Mod is still esl-flagged

  
**HOW IT WORKS:**
  
•   Create your character as you wish
  
•   Choose your starting equipment and spells, from a menu and supplementary containers
  
•   Configure all your mods and create a save – ready to go
  
•   Start in one of nearly **500**locations in Skyrim and Blackreach
  
•   Integrated with main quest and compatible with most other mods 
  
•   Main Quest thread can be picked up by visiting Helgen
  
You can either choose from classes and starting kits, or skip all that and physically select your own equipment. 
  
You can also pick starting spells, and take some mage gear if you want.
  
  
After setting up your character, you will have all the time you need to configure your mods and select gear.  Then, you're able to save your configured and outfitted character for future use.  **[Jaxonz Named Save](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48834)** can be useful for identifying your preconfigured character-build saves.  Re-use that save to begin future playthroughs and each time your character will start from a different place. 
  
(If you use Spell Research, or any mod that needs time, this is definitely your baby.) 
  
No list of possible locations is provided – you get a surprise each time.  If you try not to use the map, your experience may be more interesting.
  
  
Potential concerns:
  
  
Q. What if my character is killed off right after I start?
  
A. If you die without having saved, you're momentarily flown back to the Chamber of Mists, then teleported to a new location.
  
    You can also reload the autosave from the Chamber and relocate to a new random landing spot
  
  
Q. What if I want to join the main quest?
  
A. Take the Helgen Teleport Spell tome from the shelf on the wall.       Only use it **AFTER**you land in Skyrim. 
  
      You will arrive after Helgen was wrecked and can go anywhere you want.
