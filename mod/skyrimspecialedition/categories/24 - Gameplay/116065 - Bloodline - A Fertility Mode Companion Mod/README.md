Dragonborn Bloodline**[/font][/color]
  

**V1.2.0 Now supports both OStim Standalone and Sexlab with SLSO**

  

  
* If you currently have Bloodline v1.0.1 installed, do **not** install this as it has major changes. So, if you want to use it, start a new character.
**Designed to be played with either a Male character, or Futa** (female with schlong, set to Male gender in Sexlab's MCM **and** Fertility Mode's MCM)
  
* Can I use both Sexlab/SLSO and OStim Standalone in the same playthrough? ..... drumroll ..... Yes you can!

  
**Overview**
  
**Game Spanning Objectives**:
  
As you play through the game you create offspring so that the Dragonborn bloodline will continue.
  

  
* You have set targets to ensure you have children

﻿﻿- with all Races, (8 to 32 children each)
  
 ﻿- from every Hold, (8 to 32 children each)
  
 ﻿- and from a wide variety of Factions,  (8 to 32 children each)

  
* You will receive **permanent bonuses** to your health, magicka & stamina as each child is born,
**Major rewards** upon reaching targets set for Factions, Races, and Holds.
  
* **Final reward** upon completing all targets
Check out the new "Quests" page in the MCM for a more comprehensive overview
  

  
**Baby Target Explanation**
  
Bloodline is designed to be a quest that will **take an entire play through to achieve**. It does have a final reward for achieving the ultimate goal, but you will receive rewards along the way also.
  
  
**Baby Birth Rewards**
  
When a child is born:
  

  
* your health, stamina and magicka will permanently be increased by one point each
This continues until you have fulfilled the quota target for that Race (health), Faction (stamina), or Hold (magicka)
  

  
* The quota size is selected by you in the MCM. Depending on what you choose, the number of children required for each faction, race or hold will be from 8 to 32.

  
* There are 10 Races, 10 Holds (Solstheim included), and 10 Faction groups. So,  for example, if you choose a target of 8, then you need ( 8 x 10 = 80 )  children to get the Races reward

  
* Most often a child will add to all three of the Faction, Race and Hold targets. But it will take planning on your part to ensure you impregnate a female that best suits the targets you need to fill

  
* Sniffing a female (that's close and in your crosshairs) will now trigger a message box that tells you all her details, including her Hold, Race and factional alignments.
Some females may belong to two factional groups, eg. spellcaster/bandit, or combatant/extremist
  

  
**Faction, Race, Hold Rewards**
  

  
* When you fulfill the target for **Races** you will receive boosts of 40,000 to 160,00 points to all **Combat** skill trees, and the first Word to 20x Shouts
When you fulfill the target for **Holds** you will receive boosts of 40,000 to 160,00 points to all **Magicka** skill trees, and the 2nd Word to 20x Shouts
  
* When you fulfill the target for **Factions** you will receive boosts of 40,000 to 160,00 points to all **Stealth** skill trees, and the 3rd Word to 20x Shouts
Your MCM choice determines the rewards. There are 4 difficulty levels; (8x, 16x, 24x, & 32x) children per group, eg. a target of 8 children per group gives you a 40,000 point reward. And a target of 32 = 160,000 point reward
  
* **Warning:** The Faction/Race/Hold targets are changeable until the first one is achieved. Then it will **Lock** and become unalterable.

  
**Final Reward**
  
Upon achieving the targets for all three (Races, Holds, Factions) you will receive your final rewards of:
  

  
* Shout cool off timer reduction of (30, 40, 50 or 60)% depending on your MCM baby target selection
Shout magnitude increase of (50, 100, 150, or 200)% depending on your MCM baby target selection
  

  
**Child Support (optional)**
  

  
* You can choose to pay the mother *child support* in order to lower the chance of miscarriage (ie, better food and living conditions promote good health)
Although, you will always have a chance of miscarriage unless you give the mother a 100 Rank via sexual interactions.
  
* Once a female is pregnant, oral sex is the quickest way to boost her rank up to 100. Sniffing her should tell you how much semen she needs to swallow
Paying Child Support also benefits the player by increasing the Stat bonus you receive when a baby is born: ﻿
  

﻿- 1 septim/day/child = 1 point of Health/Magicka/Stamina when the child is born
  
 ﻿- 2 septim/day/child = 2 points ﻿" ﻿ ﻿" ﻿ ﻿" ﻿ ﻿"
  
 ﻿- 4 septim/day/child = 3 points ﻿" ﻿ ﻿" ﻿ ﻿" ﻿ ﻿"
  
 ﻿- 8 septim/day/child = 4 points ﻿" ﻿ ﻿" ﻿ ﻿" ﻿ ﻿"
  

  
* Be careful about committing to 8 septims, as that will be 800 septims each day for every 100 children you father
**Warning:** The amount you choose will **Lock** as soon as the first child is born. So you can't change it after that.
  

  
**Plus, all the features of the original SOA Mod**:
  

  
* sniff females to ascertain their fertility
force female ovulation by either: a generous Oral intake; or building a large semen pool in her vagina
  
* squirting at orgasm
burping after oral
  
* queefing after vaginal or anal

  
* track each females vaginal, oral and anal semen intake
sex gives stat bonuses to health, stamina, and magicka. And their recovery rates.
  
* sex can give increased resistances to fire, shock, ice, disease, magic, and poison
sex can cure disease
  
* convert enemies to 'non-hostile' via sex
most features can now be toggled on/off, and some now have multiple
  
variations (eg. squirt sounds can be: soft wet sound; loud splat sound; or OFF)* etc.

  
**MCM Options**:
  
You can adjust most features to your liking, such as:
  

  
* sniff visuals,
sex sounds,
  
* child targets,
child support payments, 
  
* and even turn off the main quest completely.
each setting within the MCM has an explanation of its functionality in the
  
description bar that appears when you point at the option
