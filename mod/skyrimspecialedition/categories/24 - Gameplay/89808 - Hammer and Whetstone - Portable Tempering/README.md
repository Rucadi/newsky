﻿**Hammer and Whetstone - Portable Tempering**

  
Now you can temper armor and weapons anywhere without the need of a sharpening wheel or a workbench, you just need to use a hammer or a whetstone. You can buy both items at a blacksmith store, as drop from bandits and in some places from Skyrim.
  
  
**Degradation & Tempering Penalty**
  
Hammers and Whetstones can be used only 3 times before it's removed from your inventory. Also, when using both items, the max quality that you can improve your equipment is reduced by 1 level, but if the item only have 1 use left, the quality is reduced by 2. This is an incentive to visit blacksmiths, and doesn't make the grindstone and workbench irrelevant.
  
  
If you don't like these two features, you can toggle the with the console:
  
  

```
; Disables degradation
  
﻿set eeeHammerWhetstoneDegradation to 0     ;1 or 0. Default is 1
  

  
; Disables tempering penalty
  
﻿set eeeHammerWhetstonePenalty to 0    ﻿;1 or 0. Default is 1
```

  
My other mod [Mortar and Pestle](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76337)﻿ can be used to brew potions and poisons anywhere.
  
  
**Requirements**
  

  
* [Spell Perk Item Distributor (SPID)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869): Distribution to bandits.
[Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805)﻿: Swaps some hammer references with my items.
  
* FNIS or Nemesis: Required for the animations.

  
**Repair Kit**I have another [mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76337#) with the same idea, but I wanted to make a new one with a gameplay similar to my other mod for potions with just the hammer and whetstone.
