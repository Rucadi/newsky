# Rebalancing Anniversary Edition - Quest Requirements.
- Author: criminal tango
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61004
**Inspired by "Timing is Everything" and "Radiant Requirements", RAE - Quest Requirements gives you the ability to set requirements for Creation Club quests. Works with 1.5.97 and 1.6+. Also note that this does not change Alternative Armors leveled lists, you need to get CC Armor Integration for that(link under recommended).**
  
The images should give you a general idea on what this mod does if you have no experience with TIE or Radiant Requirements. RAE - Quest Requirements uses Parapets' fantastic MCM Helper to give players the freedom to choose when they want to start each Creation. New mod page was needed as the mod was completely rebuilt from scratch and includes an MCM menu now. Anyone that used AE Level Requirements should treat this as a completely new mod.
  
  
  
Features:
  
**\***Most of the Creations have been given level requirements**.**
  
**\***Adjustable MCM menu. Your settings will be saved, no need for FISSES. Easy translation. [MCM Helper by Parapets](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53000?tab=description)is required.
  
**\***Some creations have different requirements or added conditions:
  

  
* Myrwatch - Player needs to have at least 350 mana(default) for a spell to have an effect on the activator. Just casting a low level fire spell as a warrior isn't enough anymore. Now it's truly a player home for mages - Embry can no longer get in after eating a spellbook he found lying on the ground.
Bow of Shadows - Other than the level requirement, the Thieves Guild questline has to be finished.
  
* Gray Cowl of Nocturnal - No level requirements. Starts after**[Scoundrel's Folly.](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Scoundrel%27s_Folly)**
﻿Saints and Seducers - The bandit camps only spawn after reaching the required level. Being able to start the questline through camps was an oversight in 1.0 and has been fixed.
  
* Civil War Champions - A neutral Dragonborn can no longer start the quest. Also I suggest avoiding it completely for now as according to**[UESP](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Battle_of_the_Champions)**finishing the questline can break your save.

Issues:
  
**\***[size=4] Sadly, I think the Spell Knight quest is too short to be split into 2 parts and since it gives you the steel, iron and "ebony"(which is the strongest armor in the game btw, stronger than daedric)versions basically all at once. So if you want to have the lower tier armors early - my suggestion would be to play the quest normally until you get them and then play the final part later on in the game. I'll gladly hear suggestions on how to resolve this issue.
