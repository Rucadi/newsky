In a pinch you can eat alchemical ingredients to restore your hunger. Ingredients are categorized into three groups based on how much they alleviate hunger:
  

  
* High: bigger fishes, eggs. Restore 40 points of hunger.
Medium: wheat, honey, human flesh/heart. Restore 20 points of hunger.
  
* Low: most everything else, restore 10 points.

  
These don't restore any hunger:
  

  
* things of bone or teeth, wood, ash, scale
small flowers
  
* butterfly wings
