**Requirements**
  
  
SKSE64
  
Visual C++ Redistributables 2019 
  
Address Library for SKSE Plugins
  
  
**Description**
  
  
 ﻿﻿SKSE plugin that improves and tweaks Invisibility archetype.
  
  
 **﻿Bug Fixes**
  
  

  
* Invisibility shader changed between LE and SSE, with SSE shader being incredibly transparent . This fixes the shader so skin and armor normal maps affect refraction again (ie. items seen through invisible characters will be more distorted).

  
 **Enhancements**
  
  

  
* Additional blood splatter and arrows on your character also become invisible.

  

  
* Hide alpha blended armor meshes with BSEffectShaderProperty (eg. Dragon Aspect armor) as refraction does not work on them
  

  
* Uninterrupted actions (spell will not be dispelled if activating items, configurable)
NPCs will never detect invisible characters (off by default)
  

  

  
* This applies to Invisibility and Ethereal Form effects

  
All of these can be toggled in the included *po3\_EnhancedInvisibility.ini.***Installation**
  
  

  
* Install using a mod manager.
