This mod introduces some tweaks to the seven Black Books for a more consistent experience, including updating Waking Dreams to restore a cut feature where the dungeon is not immediately accessible.
  
  
Features
  
  

  
* [Black Book quests](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Black_Book)﻿ are now named only the title of the book, without "Black Book:" at the start.
[Apocrypha locations](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Apocrypha)﻿ are now each named after the respective book, rather than all being named "Apocrypha".
  
* Apocrypha locations for each Black Book can now be [Cleared](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dungeons#Clearing)﻿ by killing the Lurker boss at the end.
Black Book powers are now named after the book, in addition to their effect title, to more easily identify their source.
  
* **Waking Dreams** and **Epistolary Acumen** now have their own Black Book quests (with appropriate [Knotwork](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/128235)﻿).
[Lost Knowledge](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Lost_Knowledge)﻿ will now be available after completing [The Path of Knowledge](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Path_of_Knowledge)﻿, so you can start finding Black Books earlier.
  

**Specific changes to [Waking Dreams](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Apocrypha_(Waking_Dreams)):**
  

  
* The area where you meet Miraak is now the "Prologue" of the book, rather than "Chapter 1".
You must free the Skaal from their own waking dreams (by completing [The Fate of the Skaal](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Fate_of_the_Skaal)﻿) before the rest of the book is unlocked.
  
* Once unlocked, you will be dropped in the area where Hermaeus Mora appears (like in every other Black Book), which is now "Chapter 1".
To realign the rest of the chapters, the area previously labelled as "Chapter 3" has been split, with the first part now being "Chapter 2".
