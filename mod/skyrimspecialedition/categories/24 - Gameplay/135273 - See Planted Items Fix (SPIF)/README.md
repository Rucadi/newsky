**Description**
  
Without this mod, your character acts as though they were blindfolded when looking at fertile soil plots and planters.   The only description under your crosshair will be "fertile soil".   With this mod you'll see descriptions like "empty fertile soil" or "planted carrots".
  
  
Also included are fixes and improvements from [Simplicity of Seeding](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/94428), [HearthFires - Customizable Fertile Soil](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69559), and [Vanilla Script (micro) Optimizations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54061).
  
  
Includes support for the Creation Club [Farming Creation](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Farming).
