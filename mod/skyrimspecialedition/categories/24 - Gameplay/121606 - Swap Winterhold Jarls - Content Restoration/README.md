Why is it always the Stormcloak jarls who must be prejudiced? Now Imperial jarls can be intolerant too! (And the Stormcloaks get a jarl who accepts the Nords' magical heritage.) **For complete functionality it is recommended to install on a new game.**
  
  
What?
  
  
[Kraldar](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Kraldar) is now the initial (Stormcloak) Jarl of Winterhold﻿, and [Korir](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Korir)﻿ is now the replacement (Imperial) Jarl of Winterhold. All packages and everything related to the Civil War have been updated.
  
  
Why?
  
  
According to the game files, Kraldar was originally supposed to be the Jarl of Winterhold - the Jarl's outfit is called JarlClothesKraldar and the house he ended up living in is actually called WinterholdKorirsHouse. There doesn't seem to be any obvious reason why they were swapped for release, so I swapped them back.
  
  
Since their opinions on the College are more defining of their character than their political allegiance, I also thought it made more sense for the Sons of Skyrim, who literally exist to safeguard Nordic heritage, to have the Jarl who's proud of Shalidor's legacy in Winterhold.
  
  
Additionally, this provides a better balance for the Stormcloak Jarls in terms of the ones you (and the population) may consider more tolerant, more likeable, or just the "better Jarl" overall. (How many other holds actually present the Stormcloak Jarl as the "better alternative" to their Imperial counterpart? Obviously Riften, maybe Falkreath? Don't really think there's any others.)
  
  
Are other Holds in the picture?
  
  
Not really. Winterhold is unique in the fact that:
  

  
* This was already the case at one point during development.
Most other Jarls' characters are directly defined by their political stance.
  
* Both Jarls have the same voice type, so swapping them doesn't affect their dialogue.

The only possibility would be Morthal, as Idgrod and Sorli don't ever mention their political stance, but their existing dialogue doesn't work the other way around.
  
  
Compatibility
  
  

  
* **Compatible** with [Serious Civil War Consequences for Jarl Balgruuf](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81554) (in which you can convince Balgruuf to join the Stormcloaks).
**Patch Included** for [Exiled Jarls Don't Require Favors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/128820).
  
* **Minor Inconsistency** with mods that add new dialogue based on the Jarls' political stance, such as More To Say.
**Probably Not Compatible** with mods that drastically edit the AI packages or NPC records of Kraldar, Korir, Thonjolf, Thaena or Assur.
