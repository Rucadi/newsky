**Weapon Armor Attribute Tweaks (WAAT)** started out as a small mod for non-WACCF users to use my [Open World Loot](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49681) without feeling inconsistent in progression. Then as I dig into the weapon and armor attributes, I found a lot of inconsistency and questionable values. So I sit down and examine the values and come up with a complete attribute tweaks for those weapons and armors.
  
  
This mod is not intended to be a replacement for [WACCF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18994). If you want a more complete overhaul and bug fixes to Skyrim's items, you should use WACCF. WAAT is an alternative for those who want a simpler approach, it has my own take on the weapon and armor attributes and traits. I will list out the feature below so you can decide if you want to use this or not.
  
  
  
**Features**
  

  
* Dwarven, Elven and Orcish weapons are now in line with the armor progression of their counterpart in term of damage. This also ensure better consistency with smithing perk. Include the [better ancient knowledge perk](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38348)﻿ so dwarven gear are relevant mid to late game.
Dragonplate armor is now higher tier than Daedric armor, just like the weapons, which is also reflected in the smithing skill tree.
  
* All weapon traits are now standardized for non-unique weapon depending on weapon type instead of material. For example, all sword have the same critical damage instead of increasing with better weapon material.
All bow are divided into 3 types: light, medium and heavy, depending on material type and looks. Each type of bow have different attribute such as draw speed, critical damage.
  
* Rebalanced the stats for some of the faction gear and items, making progression more consistent.
Incorporate some bug fixes from USSEP and WACCF. (Record-wise, meshes and texture fixes are not included)

**Requirement**
  
﻿[Open World Loot](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49681)﻿: Since WAAT didn't touched level list, you need mod for that otherwise it make no sense for the stat tweaks. Other loot mods that follow the same tier change can do too.
  
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
Not compatible with other mods that changed the same records. I suggest to check in SSEdit.
  
One thing about applying WAAT stats to other weapon and armor mod, of course you can refer to the stats list above and make a patch. But if you are not in for the patching rabbit hole, you can always give yourself excuse that every weapon/armor have different stats. :P
  
  
I included a custom WAAT patch for my artifact mod setup in the optional file, you don't need other patches other then the main files from [Reliquary of Myth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31612), [Unique Items Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33723) and [ArteFakes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41254)﻿.
  
  
  
**FAQ**
  
Q: Why are you wasting your time doing this low impact mod instead of doing something more important... like... working on you novel?
  
A: I need to clear my mind from time to time. And modding is a great relaxation for me.
  
  
Q: Does anyone really ask the question?
  
A: No. It is a reminder for myself to not get sidetracked by modding too much!
  
  
Q: So will you patch other mod like Reforging to the Masses or Animated Armory, etc. ?
  
A: It depends on my free time and I have no guarantee. But that's on my list.
