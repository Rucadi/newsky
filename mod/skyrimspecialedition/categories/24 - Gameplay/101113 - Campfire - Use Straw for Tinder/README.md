# Campfire - Use Straw for Tinder
- Author: tcbflash
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

Break down bundles of straw into straw tinder portions to light your campfires. (Campfire mod REQUIRED)
  
  
Works just like other tinders for Campfire, except just be sure to break down the bundle first (one full bundle makes 5 tinder portions)
  
  
This is flagged as ESL so it won't count towards load order limit (or regular esp option if you prefer)
  
  
NOTE - If you use JaySerpa's up-to-date version of "Gate to Sovngarde" collection, then do NOT download this mod, as it is already included in that collection. (THANK YOU JaySerpa!)
  
  
Enjoy.
