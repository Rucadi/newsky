# Keywords Fixed

I have no idea if anyone would even be interested in using this, but it really bothers me, as a Companion modder, that Keywords are not always correctly matched to Locations in the game. Just one example, my pirate comments on "Ships" yet the only "Ship" in the game properly labeled as such is the Katariah. Modders can condition more specifically of course, like naming a Cell, but Keywords come in handy for Companions commenting on new places added by other mods, such as Player Homes, Inns, Dungeons, Towns, etc., provided the modder actually *adds* the Keywords.
  
  
When I asked **Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch** about addressing this issue, they declined on the grounds that, to paraphrase, it doesn't negatively affect gameplay, and therefore isn't technically a "bug." So I just decided to take it on myself. I've fixed Keyword issues I or my modder friends have found. So far there are only a few here, but I'm sure there are more...
  
  
Because of the nature of this mod, it could be a mod you play with, or a tool for other modders to incorporate into theirs. Obviously, this is a growing project, and I'll add to it as I find issues.
  
  
Sometimes, in order to give a Location a Keyword, I had to give it a new Location name, which sometimes means renaming a cell. I do this only when necessary in effort to keep this as non-invasive as possible.
  
  
**LocTypeShip:**
  
 ﻿Added to Red Wave in Solitude as its own new Location
  
 ﻿Added to Dainty Sload
  
 ﻿Added to "WindhelmDocsExterior" cell, as new Location; it contains 4 small ships, including the Northern Wind.
  
 ﻿ ﻿I also set the Music to "ExploreCoast."
  
 ﻿The Sea Squall in Dawnstar is actually plopped across two separate cells, even though it's small enough to fit in one, thanks Bethesda. I didn't see a good way to apply the Keyword.
  
  
**LocTypeHouse:**
  
 ﻿Applied to Sinderion's Field Laboratory in Blackreach, new Location. Since it's a "safe" location, it should no longer be marked as a Dungeon or Falmer Hive.
  
  
**LocTypeStables (NEW):**
  
 ﻿Applied to all 5 City Stables: Whiterun, Markarth, Riften, Windhelm, Solitude
  
  
Carries forth USEEP change, RiverWaterFlow of WindhelmDocsExterior
  
  
**NOTE TO MODDERS:**
  
A few examples of why Keywords are important, and why you should incorporate them into your mods, where appropriate. To add Keywords, your Cell needs to have a Location, and on the Location there is a space in the lower left corner to add Keywords.
  
  
**LocTypePlayerHouse:** - My Followers (and likely some other Follower mods) can be assigned to live in any Player House, vanilla or modded, but it has to have the Keyword "LocTypePlayerHouse." It's the only way I can detect a house added by a mod :)
  
  
**LocTypeInn:** Follower mods can comment on inns, vanilla or modded, sometimes enabling special AI and/or dialogue options that Follower may have (mine can speak to Innkeepers, sing songs, and Sandbox).
