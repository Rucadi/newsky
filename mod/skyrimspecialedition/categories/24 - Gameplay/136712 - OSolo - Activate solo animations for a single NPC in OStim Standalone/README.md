# OSolo - Activate solo animations for a single NPC in OStim Standalone
- Author: daubuoi
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/136712


This mod adds a spell called 'Horny' to the player's spell inventory. When cast on an NPC, it allows you to activate solo animations for that NPC.
  
  
OStim scenes activated for an NPC will end either when the NPC reaches climax or after a maximum of 5 minutes.
  
  
When you cast the spell on an enemy, they will stop attacking you and start pleasuring themselves instead (lmao).

There are two mod versions for you to choose from:
  
  

  
* One version treats spells as an attack, and everyone will react to it (like guards, for example). This version is more immersive, because, after all, causing arousal in others is an illegal action, lmao.

  

  
* The other version simply acts as a tool to trigger Ostim scenes, without causing any reactions from other NPCs.

ESP-FE?
  
Of course.
  
  
I cast the spell, but nothing happened.
  
It may be because you cast the spell on an incompatible target (e.g., a dragon) or you don't have the solo animations installed.
