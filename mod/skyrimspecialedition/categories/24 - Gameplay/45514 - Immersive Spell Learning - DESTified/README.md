# Immersive Spell Learning - DESTified

**Preface**I was looking for mods where you had to study spells for a long while (basically because I didn't want my warrior to eat spell tomes and becoming a mage in 2 minutes)
  
  
[Better Spell Learning](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4924) is magnificent, but it requires a lot of patches to be compatible with other magic mods, and I hate taking care of patches (yes, because even if I wanted to play a warrior, I wanted the different bound weapons from [Mysticism](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839), leave me alone)
  
  
So I found [Immersive Spell Learning﻿](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33375), beautiful mod! It had everything I wanted! Except for one thing, you could still eat the tomes, and I was not completely convinced about the notes system. :(
  
  
I lost hope until the good parapets came to the rescue, with [Don't Eat Spell Tomes﻿](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43095).
  
  
So I started porting ISL to DEST, for private use only, but it occured to me to ask [Ameisenfutter](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/977979) if I could release it, he agreed, so here it is!
  
  
﻿
  
**Description and Differences with ISL**Instead of the vanilla behaviour, now when you open a spell tome, a prompt will appear asking you how much time you want to spend studying the spell tome (the prompt will also provide an estimated time needed to learn the spell)
  
  
You don't need to carry the spelltome, you can just leave it in your library while you go adventuring and when you come back, keep studying.
  
You can also study any copy of the same spellbook, if you left your spelltome at home and you find another copy in a dungeon, you can progress your study from said copy.
  
However, you can only study one spell at a time! If you are currently studying a spell and you start reading a spelltome from a different spell, a prompt will appear warning you that all progress will be lost.
  
  
The time required to learn spells is affected by the following things:
  
  

  
* The level of the spell you want to learn
Your current skill level in that school of magic
  
* Your mental aptitude (max Magicka)
If you are sitting
  
* If you are in a quiet/comfortable place (an inn or a house), with bonuses for being in the College of Winterhold and even more if in the Arcaneum

  
If you are using the CC Survival Mode or SunHelm, studying will induce Fatigue (resting after long sessions of study is highly advisable)
  
  
~~There's no MCM for now, I tailored it for what I needed and I'm not a big fan of MCMs, I might add ILS' MCM back later on.~~
  
  
MCM is now implemented.
  
  
  
**Instalation**Install like any other mod, no extra steps required.
  
  
**Compatibility**The core learning mechanic should work with any spell mod that uses spell tomes to learn spells.
  
  
As for the exhaustion options, Survival Mode and SunHelm are compatible by default.

**Load Order**Doesn't matter.
  
  
**Update/Uninstall**Should be safe to update and uninstall at any time.
  
  
**Future Plans**~~Add MCM back, probably.~~ Done.
