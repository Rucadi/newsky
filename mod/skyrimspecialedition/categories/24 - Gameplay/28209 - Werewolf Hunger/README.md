***The Backstory / Why I Made The Mod***
  
*When I first played Skyrim, I was thrilled with the option of being a werewolf~ But I found I rarely remembered or bothered to actually use Beast Form outside of the companions' questline. This made me sad. :( Then I found moonlight tales, and thought the idea of forced transformations was so cool! Then Dephine attacked me in the middle of a scene because I wasn't paying attention to the time, and didn't want to skip dialogue when I started getting warning messages... So that was the end of forced transformations for me. (No offence to MT, it's still a great mod, just a little too hardcore for me!) That was years ago and I didn't know how to mod. But now I do, so I can finally make my dream werewolf mod! (Well, one of several, actually, haha.)*
  
  
  
**What It Does**
  
It adds a kind of 'Hunger' system for werewolves.
  
I wanted a reason to actually use Beast Form. I wanted it to be *highly encouraged*, but not *get in the way* of playing.
  
I wanted being a werewolf to actually ***affect your dragonborn***, both ***in and out of werewolf form!***By default, it will start tracking after the first time you feed. After that, you will start getting **immersive notifications** when your werewolf is getting hungry, once every in-game hour(Adjustable in the MCM). IE. **You will hear distant howling, the screen will blur, and everything will turn red tinted for several seconds.** As you get even more hungry, the effects will intensify, happen more frequently, and you will start hearing growling as well.
  
  
  
**The rate your hunger increases varies base on moon phase.**
  
Werewolves hunger rate is at its max during Full Moons, and very low during New Moons.
  
  
  
**There are 4 levels of hunger, each with different bonuses/negatives:**
  
  
**Sated Beast:** HP/MP/SP Regen +5%
  
**Restless Beast:** HP Regen -5%
  
**Ravenous Beast:** HP Regen -25%, Stamina Regen -5%
  
**Famished Beast:** HP Regen -40%, Stamina Regen -5%
  
  
**Additionally, these are also affected by perks!**
  
  
***Sated Beast** additional bonuses:*
  
**Beastial Strength Lv1:** Attack Damage +5% *﻿(MT Feral Impulse)\**
  
**Beastial Strength Lv2:** Stamina +50﻿ ﻿ ﻿ *﻿(MT Juggernaut)\**
  
**Beastial Strength Lv3:** Carry Weight +25 ﻿ ﻿*﻿(MT Beastial Hide)\**
  
**Beastial Strength Lv4:** Damage Resistance +10﻿ ﻿*﻿(MT Endurance of the Wolf)\**
  
**Totem of Ice Brothers:** MP +25 ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ *﻿(MT Howl at the Moon)\**
  
**Totem of the Moon:** Stamina Regen +20% ﻿ ﻿ *﻿(MT Full Moon Rising)\**
  
**Totem of the Predator:** Movement Speed +5% ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿*(MT Roar of the Predator)\**
  
**Animal Vigor:** HP +50 ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ *﻿(MT Hircine's Blessing Lv2)\**
  
  
Note: These are the bonus at lv40+, at lower levels some of these are scaled down.
  
  
*Restless**/****Ravenous****/****Famished Beast** additional bonuses:*
  
**Totem of Terror:** Attack Damage +10/5/0% ﻿﻿*﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿(MT Roar of Terror)\**
  
**Gorging:** Lessens HP Regen debuff to -0/15/25% ﻿(Down from -5/25/40%) *﻿(MT Rejuvenation)\**
  
**Savage Feeding:** Negates Stamina Regen debuff.
  
  
*\*Requires Moonlight Tales patch. Buffs are not included in MT's perk description text due to character limits.*
  
  
  
**Additionally, there is also an option to make Beast Form into a Lesser Power, limited by hunger level.** 
  
(In vanilla it is a Greater Power available only once per day.)
  
With the new Lesser Beast Form, you will be able to transform unlimited times per day, as long as your wolf is not 'Full'. 
  
This condition is bypassed when you are either low-HP, or have the **Ring of Hircine** equipped.
  
  
**And an option to enable the Rested bonus for those with beast blood!** 
  
(In vanilla werewolves cannot gain rested bonuses from sleeping.)
  
With this option enabled, you will be able to get **Rested, Well Rested, Lover's Comfort**, ect, as long as you are Sated when you sleep. 
  
  
  
  
Sorry, I don't know anything about video editing, so.. Sucky vid, but it'll give you an idea of the effects at least!
  
Also, the vid was taking on LE, the effects look slightly different in SE, but they're similar enough.
  
The spectral wolf in the vid is [Styx](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/98451)! <3
  
  
  
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
  
For werewolf mods, it is compatible with anything that does not affect the **WerewolfFeedRestoreHealth** Magic Effect.
  
  
Compatible with any **werewolf mesh** or **texture replacers**.
  
Compatible with **Predators - A Werewolf and Vampire Role Playing Tool**
  
Compatible with **Bloodmoon Rising!** Load BR after WH.
  
Compatible with **Moonlight Tales**, with the patch under optional files! Load MT after WH.
  
Compatible with **Lupine - Werewolf Perk Expansion!** Load Lupine after WH. If using the Lupine(Left side) perk tree, also get the patch under optional files! Load the patch after Lupine.
  
  
Mostly compatible with **Werewolf perk replacements**. Load them after WH and they should work fine, you just won't get the perk descriptions for the bonuses, and if the perk mod is adding new perks instead of modifying the existing ones, you will not get the additional bonuses.
  
  
Leave a comment if there's any other mod you're curious about, or if you'd like a compatibility patch and I'll see what I can do~
