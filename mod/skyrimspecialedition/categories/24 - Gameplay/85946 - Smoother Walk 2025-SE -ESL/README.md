SMOOTHER WALKING (LEFT)                        VS             DEFAULT SPEEDY GONZALEZ (RIGHT)
  
*"HAVE YOU EVER FELT...."
  
"YES."
  
"BUT I HAVEN'T EVEN SAID...."
  
"ALL THE TIME."*
  
  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~****WELL, I GUESS...THIS MOD TURNS DOWN THE GOOFY FAST WALKING IN SKYRIM.
  
FOR EVEN BETTER, NON SUSPICIOUS IMMERSION 
  
  
\*\*\*
  
1 REGULAR WALK (UNTOUCHED)
  
*1 FASTER JOG, OR KNOWN IN AMERICA AS A POWER WALK*
  
1 SPRINT (UNTOUCHED)****\*\*\*
  
  
[font=Courier New]THIS MOD FOCUSES ON THE 2ND SPEED TO HIGHLIGHT WALKING
  
SO NOW YOU HAVE 2 WALKING SPEEDS
  
AND YOUR GOOFY FAST MAP-ZIPPING WILL STAY WITH THE SPRINTS.
  
  
*THIS BOOSTS YOUR DAY TO DAY IMMERSION
  
AND MAKES YOU CONSIDER RUNNING AS AN EFFORT NOW.*[/font][font=Courier New]
  
[/font]
  
  
[b]*+ONLY TOUCHES JOGGING SPEED, NO COMBAT, HORSE, SWIMMING ETC
  
FOR MAX MOD COMPATIBILITY & BECAUSE OTHER MODS ALREADY ADD FEATURES TO THEM.
  
+SAFE TO INSTALL, UNINSTALL ANYTIME
  
PLACE EARLY IN LOAD ORDER, RIGHT AFTER DAWNGUARD, DRAGONBORN ETC..
  
  
  
Should work with OAR mods. This esp only touches the default skyrim speed.***
