Installation: With your prefered Mod Manager or just drag and drop the data folder into your Skyrim's Directory,
  
  
Adding More Presets: if you never added more than one Smoothcam Preset, it's pretty simple, go to Data\SKSE\Plugins, you have 6 slots in total, and they're named "SmoothCamPreset(number)" just change the final number from 0 to 5 (0 counts as 1 in game) so it would be like SmoothCamPreset0,SmoothCamPreset1,SmoothCamPreset2...
