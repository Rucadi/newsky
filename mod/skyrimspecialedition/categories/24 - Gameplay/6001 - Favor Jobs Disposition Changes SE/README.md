# Favor Jobs Disposition Changes SE
- Author: cloudedtruth
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6001
Description:   
Changes some of the favor jobs (harvest crops, mine ore, and chop firewood) so NPCs don't befriend you after just selling to them once.   
   
You now need to sell to them multiple times before they'll befriend you.   
   
   
How It's Been Changed:   
You'll have to sell to farmers, miners, and lumberjacks/innkeepers 10 different times instead of once. If you bring them a large quantity of the items to sell, it'll count as selling to them twice (large quantity numbers: one kind of crop - 30, ore - 20, firewood - 20). You also can't sell them items again within a short amount of time (less than 1 in-game hour) and have it count as selling to them more than once. This was mainly done to prevent you from selling several different crops to the same farmer in a short amount of time.
  
   
   
Compatibility/Load Order:   
This will conflict with any mod that alters the following records/files:   
   

  
* Quest - FavorJobsGatherWheat
Quest - FavorJobsMineOre   
* Quest - FavorJobsChopWood
Script - FavorJobsGatherWheatScript   
* Script - FavorJobsMineOreScript
Script - FavorJobsChopWoodScript   

  
~~A known conflicting mod is Complete Alchemy & Cooking Overhaul (CACO), but there is a compatible version available.~~   
CACO hasn't been updated for SE at this time.
  
Any other mod with conflicts will need to be patched in order to be compatible.
  
   
To make use of the features in this mod, load it near the bottom of your load order.
  
   
   
Install:   
Recommended to install using a mod manager (Mod Organizer 2 or Nexus Mod Manager is recommended). For manual users, place the plugin and scripts into the data folder.
  
   
   
Uninstall:   
Use a mod manager for simple uninstallation. For manual users, remove the plugin and 3 scripts + 3 source files from your data folder.
  
   
   
Other Notes:   
You currently can only change the large quantity value by using the in-game console. ~~If people want to be able to customize the different values in this mod, I'm very willing to create a MCM. I didn't create one from the start because I felt it was a little unnecessary for a mod of this size, but am certainly open to creating one.~~Without SKSE & a updated SkyUI, a MCM can't be used in-game. And both SKSE and SkyUI are not available for SE at this time.
