**About this mod**
  
  
Looking for even more immersion in your game?
  
  
**Wade in Water Redux** builds on doodlum’s excellent *[Wade in Water Redone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71418)(Download and Endorse!)*, and expands it with a brand-new mechanic:
  
  
Your swimming speed now dynamically depends on what you're wearing.
  
  
Whether you're in heavy, light, or cloth armor, you'll feel the difference as you move through the water. No more sprint-swimming through rivers in full plate like a dolphin. This mod brings a subtle but meaningful change that rewards strategic gear choices and adds realism to exploration and combat.
  
  
  
**Features**

  
* Keeps doodlum’s underwater slowdown mechanics based on submersion level
Adds equipment-based movement scaling
  
[list]
  
* Heavy armor slows you down the most
Light armor slows you moderately
  
* Cloth armor has minimal impact
No armor (nude) is the fastest — finally a reason to run around naked in Skyrim!
  

[\*]Fully configurable via .ini file
  
[\*]Lightweight and script-free
  
[/list]
  
  
**Available Versions**
  
Choose between Basic and Softened Penalties — with the latter reducing Light and Heavy Armor swim penalties by one third.
  
  
  
**How does it work and how to adjust it?**
  
  
By default, your swimming speed is reduced by 56% (in the Redux ESP), so you don’t swim faster than you can run.
  
This base reduction ensures immersion and balance.On top of that, additional slowdowns are applied based on your equipped armor.
  
  
These penalties are defined in the included .ini file and can be easily adjusted:
  
**[ArmorSwimPenalty]**
  
fHeavyBody   = 0.14
  
fLightBody   = 0.07
  
fClothBody   = 0.023
  
fHeavyFeet   = 0.07
  
fLightFeet   = 0.03
  
fClothFeet   = 0.01
  
fHeavyHands  = 0.05
  
fLightHands  = 0.02
  
fClothHands  = 0.007
  
fHeavyHead   = 0.02
  
fLightHead   = 0.01
  
fClothHead   = 0.003 
  
  
These values represent percentage-based slowdowns and are added on top of the base 56%. For example, wearing a heavy cuirass (+14%) and heavy boots (+7%) would result in a total swimming slowdown of 77% (56% + 14% + 7%).
  
There is a hard cap at 90% slowdown — meaning no matter what you wear, your swimming speed will never be reduced below 10% of its base value.
