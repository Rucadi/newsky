The "Biggies trait" mod has a tutorial on how to add traits so i tried it myself. This mod adds 6 new traits. I will add more stuff in the future. I am still learning therefore its rather simple, but still fun stuff.
  
The first main file ttraits are build for my own list and are **NOT** designed/got no patch for Requiem. You could probably still use them, but their power level is rather high.
  
The other file is designed for requiem balance.
  
The mod is esl flagged.
  
If you experience any issues please let me know so i can try to fix it.
  
  
**List of traits**
  
Spoiler**Wayfarer**: Pilgrimage of the 7,000 steps has tempered your body and will. Your knowledge and pace to traverse Skyrim is unmatched,
  
granting <33%> increased movement speed out of combat. However, in shunning the
  
easy path, you cannot fast travel.
  
  
**UndyingRage**: When grievously wounded, your resolve hardens and you become more difficult
  
to harm, but your strength wanes with your lifeblood. As your health
  
diminishes, you suffer and inflict less damage: at <90%> health,
  
you deal and receive <90%> damage; and so on. However, the closer
  
you are to death, your attacks and spells become proportionally
  
weakened. Summons are capped at 1.
  
  
**Necromancer**: You have bartered with death, trading vitality for dominion over the unseen.
  
Necrotic powers answers your sacrifice. For every 200 base Magicka, you
  
may command one additional summoned minion upto 600 base magicka. You
  
also gain <+5> Magicka on every level up. However, your starting
  
health begins <-30> lower and restoration spells have no affect on
  
 you.
  
  
**MoonWorshipper**: Beneath the gaze of Masser and Secunda, your arcane strength flourishes. Spells gain <15%>
  
potency at night, rising to <30%> from midnight to 1am. However,
  
dawn brings decline, weakening your spells by <25%> under the
  
sun's glare.
  
  
**Fasting**: You are fasting and abstain from food for health benefits. Food offers no benefits.
  
However, your weight loss allows you to carry more stuff <+50>
  
carryweight. Additionally, you regenerate 1 stamina per second.
  
  
**LoneWolf**: Solitude is strength, to depend on the presence of the crowd is weakness.
  
Deal <15%> more damage when alone, but deal <15%> less damage being in a group.
  
  
**Thornmail**: Your body becomes armor and weapon: each strike you endure cuts into your
  
foes, but the weave that empowers you leaves you vulnerable.
  
Gain <+100> Hp and <+5> Hp per level up, reflect <100%> of
  
physical damage taken, but receive <30%> more magical and
  
<50%> more physical damage.
  
  
**Hawkeye**: You are a master with the bow, loosing arrows with unerring precision even amidst
  
chaos. Your shots strike harder, dealing <30%> more damage.
  
However, subtlety is not your strength causing sneak attacks with bows
  
to deal <50%> less damage.
  
  
**Forsaken by Magnus**: Born beneath a fractured star, you are cut off from the flow of magicka but
  
carry a hollow that draws in power. You have a <20%> chance to
  
absorb enemy spells. However, you do not regenerate magicka passively.
  
  
**Boethiah’s Precision**: You strike with brutal force, following up each blow with a finishing
  
swing. Power attacks deal <50%> more damage, but cost <50%>
  
more stamina.
  
  
**Botanist**: You study the flora of Tamriel with unmatched care. Gain <+1> extra ingredient when harvesting
  
and learn all alchemical effects upon tasting. However, your time in the
  
 wilds has dulled your caution thus damage from wild animals is
  
increased by <75%>.
  
  
**Nocturnal’s Whisper**: Nocturnal watches from the shadows as your fingers work in silence. Lockpicks
  
never break in your hands, but every lock resists with unnatural
  
cunning, becoming <75%> harder to open.
  
  
**Executioner’s** Rhythm: Destruction flows through you with terrifying ease, but such
  
power never comes without a price. You deal <100%> more damage.
  
However, you take <100%> more damage.
  
  
**Merchant**: A life of commerce has sharpened your tongue and filled your coinpurse,
  
but left little room for martial discipline. Buying and selling prices
  
are <30%> better. Additionally, gain 100 gold per day.
  
However, your weapon damage and spell
  
effectiveness are reduced by <10%>.
  
  
**Paladin**: You walk a righteous path. Restoration magic flows <20%> stronger through you empowering your healing arts. Daedric artifacts
  
lose their favor providing no armor rating or weapon damage while
  
equipped.
  
  
**Survivor of Helgen**: You emerged from Helgen wreathed in flame, marked by fire that was
  
never meant to spare you. Some would call it divine purpose, others a
  
cruel jest. You gain <25%> fire resistance. However, the shadow of
  
 the World-Eater still clings to you; you deal <20%> less damage
  
to dragons and take <20%> more from their wrath.
  
  
When the sky is torn and time itself broken, even this scar may begin to fade.
  
  
**Paladin**: You walk a righteous path. Restoration magic flows <20%> stronger through you empowering your healing arts. Daedric artifacts lose their
  
favor providing no armor rating or weapon damage while equipped.

**Procedure to reset traits:**
  
**1)** Open console and type the following: **player.additem fe54b0ce 1** or type **help slate** to find ID of '*Potion of Blank Slate*' or look up ID under Ingestibles in xEdit.
  
This will grant you a potion that will remove all traits
  
Drink the potion.
  
  
**2)** In console again, type the following: **player.addspell Traits\_SelectionSpell**
  
This will grant you the power to pick traits again.
  
Use the power to pick any trait. I tested it with wayfarer and thornmail and
  
both values etc got properly removed
  
  
***3)** (optional)* If you wish to change traits again after the first reset, the power
  
will be locked in power menu for some reason, so you will need to remove
  
 it and re-add it again.
  
Type in console: **player.removespell Traits\_SelectionSpell** and repeat steps **1)** and **2)**.
