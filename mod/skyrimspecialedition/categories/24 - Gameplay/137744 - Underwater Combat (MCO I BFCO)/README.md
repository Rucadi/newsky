Enemies no longer just watch you swim and do nothing, they will jump in and fight you! 
  
Lets you and NPCs attack in the water (using special underwater combat animations)
  
 to support underwater spellcasting (your magic casting animation has also been edited so that you actually cast magic in the water.) 
  
(Yes, you can set fire or discharge in the water, although it is a bit unreasonable)
  
 Support First-Person
  
 Support Werewolf Underwater Attack
  
 Support Horse Riding Water Attack
  
  
 ESP is tagged by ESP-FE 
  
Compatible with most popular mods
  
(Probably a bit incompatible with bfco, its built-in underwater attack can affect judgment)
  
  
 Any skill that puts an enemy in a ragdoll state in the water will make him unable to attack
  
, but with a simple edit, it will "not equal IsSwimming" Added to spells that put enemies in ragdoll state
  
  
 **Installation & Uninstallation:** anytime
  
  
AE supported?
  
The AE version requires the download of [Sink Or Swim NG](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78610) and overrides DLL
  
  
 **incompatibility**

Loki's Wade In Water \Sink Or Swim
  
, this mod already includes a slowdown effect to enable animation switching
  
requirements It is necessary to turn on the animation replacer
  
They do the same thing, you shouldn't install the above two with Underwater Combat (MCO I BFCO) installed, that could lead to Unknown situation
  
  
  
**Require**
  
  
[Open Animation Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92109) is necessary, without it there would be no swimming animation
  
  
[Sink Or Swim NG](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78610)   It is necessary for AE or updated versions
  
(Because Water Attack Redo includes Sink Or Swim based on SE version)
  
(If you are a 1.5.97 version of the game, you can ignore the requirement of Sink Or Swim NG)
  
  
[True Directional Movement](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51614) is mandatory
  
  
 [Attack MCO|DXP](https://www.distaranimation.com/mods/attack) is required, otherwise it will play its own attack action (it does not affect other actions)
  
  
[BFCO - Aggression Behavior Framework (SSE AE VR) If](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/117052) you use BFCO, after testing, the continuous brute force attack animation plays normally, but simple attackswill be problematic
