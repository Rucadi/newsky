**﻿Brawling - No Hitting Bystanders**
  
This mod prevents you from getting a bounty or getting aggroed when someone decides to run in front of you as you are trying to punch your opponent.
  
The mod uses SPID to distribute a spell to all npcs and makes everyone unhittable besides the player and the brawling opponent.
  
  
Here's a video of the mod in action:
  
  
  
Requirements:
  

  
* [Spell Perk Item Distributor (SPID)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869)﻿ by PO3
[powerofthree's Papyrus Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22854)﻿ by PO3
  

  
How it works:
  
SpoilerBasically the spell that is distributed will only activate during one stage of the brawling quest (DGIntimidateQuest stage 10). Anyone near the player who is not the person they are brawling will have their "Is Ghost" flag set to enabled. This will make all your attacks go through the npc and not register. Once the brawl ends or they get out of range, they will have the flag removed. Any npc that has the "Is Ghost" flag already enabled will not be effected by the flag removal.
