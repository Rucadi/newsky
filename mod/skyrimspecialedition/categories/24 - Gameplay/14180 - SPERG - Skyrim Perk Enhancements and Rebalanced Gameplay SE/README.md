**2. Description**
  
=====================================================================
  
In  vanilla Skyrim, some skills are much harder to level than others, and some perk trees are near completely worthless. SPERG fixes both of those things by adjusting skill leveling rates, adding a number of different sources of skill gain for some of the harder skills to level, and completely overhauling the perk trees. The leveling adjustments reward players for actually going out and playing the game instead of just grinding skills because they don't go up fast enough any other way, and SPERG's perks are truly exceptional. Far from being the boring, minimalist perks of the regular game, each perk is meaningful and unique. Many perks could even be made into their own standalone mod. Give SPERG a shot and see why so many people refuse to play without it!

***Why install this mod?***
  
Import your existing character
  
While it's meant for a new character, SPERG will automatically import existing characters when you first load it. Make a backup save to be safe (you should always do this when installing a new mod) and give it a try now, not later.
  
  
More playstyles
  
Play the character you want without worrying about gimping yourself in combat. Characters like non-destruction mages and dagger rogues are much more viable with this mod.
  
  
Modular design without the installation fuss
  
SPERG installation doesn't require choosing between multiple different modules or combinations of plugins - you just install it and play. If you want more customization, the in-game menu has plenty of options. For users who really want to get into the thick of modding, SPERG lets you override any tree you want, and it also supports custom plugins. It's as simple or as complicated as you want it to be.
  
  
Seamless integration with the original game
  
Everything this mod adds could easily be a part of the original game if you didn't know better. Making sure that a first time player would have no idea they're using a mod was one of my top priorities.
  
  
More variety
  
Too many characters in vanilla Skyrim end up playing almost exactly alike. Access to more varied perks and abilities gives each character a truly unique feel, making the game more fun on its own and creating more interesting tools for role-playing. Want to play a survivalist hunter who lives in peace with wild animals? Now you can.
  
  
Brings the fun back to leveling
  
With more perks to look forward to and more unique abilities, you can really feel your character progressing instead of feeling like the only thing that changes is the look of your weapon. The way your character plays will change as he or she grows.
  
  
Meticulously balanced
  
While there's always room for improvement, I've put a lot of effort into making sure these changes are consistently balanced. The overall power level is slightly higher than in the original Skyrim due to the perks themselves being better, but there shouldn't be any singularly overpowered perks or skill trees. When needed, I even calculated ability damage based on the game's internal formulas to make sure it was consistent.
  
  
Skill synergy
  
The old perk trees only ever gave benefits to their related skill, which made skills feel disconnected and left certain skills without much use. The new perk trees give a lot more benefit to other skills, increasing the complexity of different character builds, and making even the most useless skills more interesting.
  
  
Minimal conflicts
  
Everything is carefully designed to have as few conflicts with other mods as possible. Even where conflicts arise, fixing them (or at least finding workarounds) should be relatively simple. SPERG is extremely mod friendly.
  
  
Modder's resource
  
I've included the source code for all of my scripts, with the most generally applicable ones being generously commented. If you see an interesting ability that you want to copy or expand upon, you can find out exactly how it works.
  
  
Less grinding, more playing
  
With SPERG, you don't have to worry about things like letting a mudcrab hit you enough so your armor skill keeps up with your other skills. Forget about grinding and just play. SPERG takes care of the rest.
  
  
***What exactly does it do?***
  
Smooth scaling
  
Rather than tying skill improvement to a series of perks that you purchase as your skill increases, SPERG ties it to your skill directly. You no longer have to worry about what perks to take if you want a skill to be effective. Perks add new things, not make existing things better.
  
  
Automatic perks
  
Similar to how the skill system worked in Oblivion, you earn unique bonus perks at 25, 50, 75, and 100 in each skill. These are great rewards for leveling up skills even if you don't intend to spend any perk points on them.
  
  
New perk trees
  
It goes without saying that perk trees are completely redone in this mod. Nothing was removed (just made automatic or combined with other perks), but well over a hundred completely unique perks have been added.
  
  
Fully Configurable
  
Don't like an item in this list? Don't worry, it can be turned off. You'll never have to worry about a feature you don't like being bundled with features you do.
  
  
Improves Skill Rates
  
Through the Skyrim Uncapper, this mod tweaks the leveling rates of each skill (but only slightly). The aim was to reduce grinding and balance the rate at which all skills increase, but to do so without changing the feel of the original game. While the values I've suggested are well balanced, you're free to change them or turn this feature off entirely.
  
  
Alternate Skill Gain
  
SPERG adds several alternate sources of skill gain to make leveling feel more natural. For example, your Speech skill goes up when you use shouts in combat, and your armor skill goes up when you wear it while running around. Play the game, not the skill system.
  
  
Equipment Salvaging
  
Loot and steal to your heart's content, breaking down all kinds of items into raw components that you can use to improve your Smithing. This is a great addition if you have problems finding enough raw material to level the skill, or even if you just like stealing everything that isn't nailed down.
  
  
Quest rewards
  
As another fix to skill rates, this mod grants a free, semi-random skill gain every time you complete a quest. This is another aspect of SPERG that encourages you to just play the game instead of grind, and it also helps to soften the disappointment when a quest reward is totally useless to you.
  
  
Perk reset
  
You can completely reset your perks whenever you want. By default, this applies a temporary penalty to health, magicka, and stamina to make sure it doesn't feel like cheating, but if you feel like I do that this should have been included from the beginning, you can turn the penalty off entirely. You can even turn it off after it's been applied and it will retroactively disappear!
  
  
Minimalist unarmed support
  
Unarmed combat is made completely viable with little changes to it. There are no monk style semi-magical abilities so as not to conflict with the existing flavor in Skyrim. Instead, unarmed characters take on the role of a bar-brawling scoundrel, which is much more fitting (especially for Nords!).
  
  
Better spell scaling
  
All spells now scale directly with skill level. Destruction spells deal more damage, Illusion spells affect higher level targets, Restoration spells heal (or damage) more, and both Illusion and Conjuration spells last longer. At 100 skill, spells are twice as effective.
  
  
Better staves
  
Playing a pure mage can be rough at low levels, but now staves can really help out. While staves were already powerful, using them came at the expense of leveling your own magic skills. Now, using a staff levels your magic skills like it always should have. To add to the fun, you can even learn spells from staves of all kinds, including unique staves like Wabbajack and Skull of Corruption.
  
  
***Perk Trees***
  
Of course, this description can't be complete without including the new perk trees. However, the formatting on this page is somewhat limited, so I'd recommend just downloading the mod and checking it out! If you want to take a peek before downloading, then look below.
