[Remember Lockpick Angle](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26838) is a lovely quality-of-life mod, but it felt too free. This mod adds a perk to Requiem's Lockpicking tree, so now this feature requires spending a perk point to get.
  
  
This mod uses Perk Adjuster to dynamically insert the perk into Lockpicking tree, so it's compatible with mods that change the Lockpicking. ESP-FE file so it doesn't take up a slot in your load order.
