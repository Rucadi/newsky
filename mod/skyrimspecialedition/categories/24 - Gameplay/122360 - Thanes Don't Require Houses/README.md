# Thanes Don't Require Houses
- Author: Enodoc
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/122360


In the base game, you don't need to buy the house in Whiterun before becoming Thane, and the minor holds have no houses to buy at all (without Hearthfire). This mod removes the House Purchase requirement to becoming Thane in Solitude, Windhelm, Markarth and Riften, so you only need to help the citizens of the hold.
  
  
**Prefer to have the opposite? Check out [Thanes Require Houses](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/122359), which adds a house requirement to Thaneship in Falkreath, Hjaalmarch and the Pale.**
  
  
Additional Features
  
  

  
* Housecarls will wait in the palace or keep if you don't own the house.
Fully voiced, with updated objectives to reflect new requirements.
  
* Also works for Whiterun if you never purchased Breezehome before Balgruuf was replaced by another Jarl.
