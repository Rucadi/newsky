Skyrim's files contain a plethora of randomly cut content including quests, locations, NPCs, spells, and much more.
  
This mod aims to restore as much of that content as possible while also staying faithful to the original interpretations, and only if necessary, improving in a way to fit with the lore and quality standards of the final release.
  
  
  
**This mod includes the [Bear's Cave Mill](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/84768) mod I released as well.****[Granite Hill](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/117585) is found on a separate mod page﻿.**

**Locations**

  
* Bear’s Cave Mill: South of Pinewatch in its original spot before it was cut.
Irontree Mill: I had to move this as it's original spot is way to close to Ironback Hideout, causing the inhabitants to constantly be attacked by bandits. You can find it on the coast near Shadowgreen Cavern.
  
* Barleydark Farm: Farm near the puzzle pillars in Whiterun Hold restored at the original spot.
Frost River Farm: Restored in its original spot east of the Solitude Sawmill. Except it looks like after Bethesda removed the farm, they replaced it with a dragon mound. So I made the decision that when the dragon mound opens, the farm gets burned down :(. Bethesda never intended this to happen but I figured it makes more sense than having nobody at the farm acknowledge the fact the mound opened. The mound opens off-screen during '*Diplomatic Immunity'*. But the dragon is long gone by the time you get there.
  
* Castle Dour Tower: Restores access to General Tullius’ private tower where you can also get a cool view of Solitude.
Dark Chasm: A small unremarkable cave that was supposed to appear in the Soul Carin (added in v1.2) 
  
* Hoarfrost Grotto: A small ice cave home to a frost atronach. I've adjusted the layout a bit to be consistent with Bethesda's finished ice caves and added a necromancer to explain the atronach. I took more liberty with this one as the original was very unfinished (v1.3)
Riverwatch: A small snowy wolf den that was supposed to appear between Kynesgrove and Windhelm. (v1.3.4)
  
* Uglarz' Hut: Not actually cut content, this place is a made up location that's necessary for FreeFormNarzulburWifeQuest to make sense. (v2.0)
Restored a POI that was supposed to appear in the Whiterun tundra which involves a werewolf in a cage. (v2.0)
  
  

  
**Quests**
  

  
* Filling Soul Gems: Sergius needs you to help fill a grand soul gem for him (repeatable) (added in v1.3.2)
Rogue Wizard: Tolfdir would like you to "Take care of" a wizard who's been wrecking havok, it's quite possible that said mage felt the effects of the Eye closing. (Repeatable radiant quest which starts after you finish 'The Eye of Magnus') According to the Prima guide this quest isn't supposed to have a reward (added in v1.2) 
  
* Supply Line (Misc quest): Rigvar wants you to deliver some of his ‘Soon to be famous” Frost River mead to various taverns in Skyrim. (Spoiler: it doesn’t become famous) Rigvar dies once Frost River Farm is burned down so you won't be able to get the quest at that point
Missing Apprentices (Misc quest): Phinis has been wondering what happened to four college apprentices: Rundi, Borvir, Ilas-Tei, and Yisra. This quest starts without quest markers since Phinis is unable to give directions as he’s unsure where they are. (This quest is not related to the other four apprentices or the dremora in The Midden in any way, that’s a whole separate story)
  
The dialogue to start this quest opens up once you listen to Phinis' lecture on college policy (lectures are held at around 2 pm every day)
  
* [size=3]FreeFormNarzulburWifeQuest: Chief Mauhulak is looking for a wife and only YOU can help him. (v2.0)
  
Runil's Dark past: Not really a quest, but uses a quest so it can run. You can now learn about Runil's past.  (v2.0)
  
* Research Thief: Nirya would like you to steal Faralda's notes.
Salvaging (dunBrinehammerQST): This quest starts upon finding an old journal in the Wreck of the Brinehammer. Take the journal to Giraud Germane at the Bard's College to get it published as a book you can earn profit from.

[size=3]**Items**

  
* Sild’s Staff: Belongs to Sild the Warlock in Rannveig’s Fast. Summons subjugated ghosts.
Golldir’s Note to Vals Veran: a note with some backstory for Vals Veran
  
* Briarheart Geis: Unique axe wielded by the Forsworn boss at Lost Valley Redoubt
Mzinchaleft guard’s note: a note carried by the bandit standing guard outside Maluril’s room in Mzinchaleft.
  
* Unsent Afflicted’s Letter: Contains some interesting backstory for the Afflicted in Bthardamz as well as mentioning the state of Cul Aloue in the 4th era)
Some more robes which were unused. You can buy them at Radiant Raiment in Solitude.
  
* The Secrets of Ragnvald: A poem which can be found in Ragnvald on a pedestal in the entry hall.

Herebane's Fortress and Herebane's Courage: These were supposed to be found on Herebane's Corpse in Kilkreath Ruins. (The dungeon was originally supposed to be filled with regular corpses and ghosts, but it looks like Bethesda wanted to make the dungeon a bit more unique and changed it to shades and desecrated corpses. Since Herebane is a regular corpse, they removed him. Though near the entrance inside there is a desecrated corpse with a closed imperial helmet. I'm confident this was where he was placed originally based on FormIDs) (v2.0)
  
* Shalidor's Insights: Magicka: Scroll which was originally intended for the reward table of its related quest (v2.0)

* Rigvar (same story as Bronvid except he’s the alternative to Rundi)
Mithorpa Nasyal: a boring dunmer farmer with only two (three if you’re dunmer) unique lines of dialogue. He has a cool farm.
