**Pilgrim - A Reli****gion Overhaul**

  
Pilgrim is a complete overhaul of Skyrim’s religion system that adds dozens of new deities and with powerful shrine effects to the game. It also turns several priests in the hold capitals into vendors who sell thematically appropriate items such as amulets, potions, spells, and scrolls. The priests also offer services such as Cure Disease Potions and scrolls of Divine Intervention. 
  
  
Pilgrim contains several custom map markers which will be displayed automatically if you use the awesome [CoMAP - Common Map Markers Addon Project](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56123), which we highly recommend.
  
  
**Pilgrims and Cultists**
  
  
Pilgrim adds two perks to the game, Pilgrim and Cultist respectively. The Pilgrim perk is in the Restoration tree, and it governs gods such as the Divines, Auriel, and the All-Maker. The Cultist perk is in the Conjuration tree, and it governs gods such the Daedra, Mannimarco, and Sithis.
  
  
Both of these perks have two ranks, one at 30 and one at 60 of their respective. The first rank doubles the strength of the relevant shrines. The second rank adds a second, additional bonus that you receive when you are under the effect of the relevant shrines. 
  
  
**Prayer**
  
  
The first time you pray at a shrine, you will receive a Lesser Power called Prayer. This power will allow you to meditate in order to receive a blessing from the last shrine you prayed at. Prayer works with both Divine and Daedric shrines, and you do not need to have invested in either the Pilgrim or Cultist perks to use it. 
  
  
Praying in this manner does not cure diseases (in fact, neither does praying at shrines--check the “Priestly Vendors” section for more important on how to cure diseases with this mod). 
  
  
**The Shrines**
  
  
***The Divines***
  
The Divines are the most commonly worshiped gods in the land. They have numerous temples, amulets, and shrines located around the world. They are governed by the Pilgrim perk in Restoration.
  
  
 Spoiler**Akatosh** - You gain 10/20% more experience. / You have 25 extra Health, Magicka, and Stamina.

Pilgrim also buffs the amulets of the Divines to match the power of their shrine bonuses.***Other Benevolent Deities***
  
  
These deities are worshipped by other cultures not native to Skyrim. Although their worship is less common, it is not usually perceived as malicious. Their shrines are rare, and may be more difficult to find. They are governed by the Pilgrim perk in Restoration.

**Y’ffre** - Your Stamina is increased by 25/50. / You move 25% faster while drawing a bow.***Tall Papa and The All-Maker***
  
  
These two deities are listed separately because they have slightly more complex effects. They are governed by the Pilgrim perk in Restoration.
  
  
Spoiler**The All-Maker**  - The All-Maker does not have a single shrine. Instead, each of the six All-Maker Stones represent one aspect of his being.

These deities are dark gods whose worship is shunned by polite society. They are, for the most part, Daedric Princes, although a few other malevolent entities are presented here. The powers these gods provide are much more volatile, and extract a great cost from their worshippers. They are governed by the Conjuration perk Cultist.

**Mannimarco** - Your Conjuration spells cost 10/20% less. / You can reanimate one additional zombies, but when you do not control a reanimated zombie, your Armor Rating is reduced by 150 and your Magic Resistance is reduced by 25%.
  
**Mehrunes Dagon** - Destruction spells cost 10/20% less. / You reduce the Fire, Frost, and Shock Resistance of all nearby enemies by 25%, but your own Fire, Frost, and Shock Resistance are reduced by 50%.
  
**Mephala** - Your Health is increased by 25/50. / You deal 50% extra damage to enemies who fall below half Health, but you take double damage when you fall below half Health.

**Sanguine** - Your Health Regeneration is increased by 25/50%. / Your potions last twice as long, but when you are not under the effect of a potion, your Movement Speed is reduced by 50%.
  
**Sheogorath** - Your Magicka Regeneration is increased by 25/50%. / Your Frenzy spells deal 10 Magic damage per second, but you take double damage from frenzied targets.
  
**Sithis** - You are 10/20% better at sneaking. / Sneak attacks with One-handed weapons deal 50% more damage, but all other attacks deal 50% less. 
  
**Vaermina** - Illusion spells cost 10/20% less. / Illusion spells last half as long, but they reduce enemy Armor Rating by 150 and Magic Resistance by 25%. This effect is reversed for Command spells.
  
**Priestly Vendors**
  
  
Pilgrim turns one priest in each of the five major cities into a special class of vendor. These priests will sell a few spell tomes, but more importantly, they will sell healing and defensive items such as potions and scrolls. They will also sell special scrolls of Divine Intervention. These scrolls will allow you to teleport to their respective temples. If you are an Expert or above in Restoration, you will be able to buy a spell of Divine Intervention from each of the five priests, which will allow you to teleport to their temple without consuming an item. 
  
  
Since shrines no longer cure diseases in Pilgrim, the priests will be sure to stock extra potions of Cure Disease. You may wish to purchase a few before embarking on a long journey. 
  
**Compatibility**
  
  
Pilgrim is not compatible with other religion overhauls. Pilgrim *is* compatible with all Standing Stone overhauls (if you were worried about Tall Papa).
  
  
Pilgrim is compatible with Adamant without a patch. It will overwrite any effects from Adamant, so if there are any discrepancies between the two mods, Pilgrim will win. You should make sure to use the latest version of Adamant and Mysticism. You should not use the “Adamant Shrines and Amulets” plugin with this mod. 
  
  
If you’d like to use Pilgrim with Ordinator, Vokrii, or Vanilla perks, you’ll need to download one of the patches we’ve provided within the FOMOD. The Vokrii patch changes Auriel's buff since Auriel's functionality is already included in Vokrii as a perk.
  
  
Pilgrim does edit the Vanilla magic effects for Sun Fire, Vampire’s Bane, and Stendarr’s Aura in order to implement Auriel’s “Bathed in Light” ability. Sorry, there's no other way to implement this effect. 
  
  
There are no Vanilla keywords for Poison and Sun magic, so for this mod to recognize spells as either Poison or Sun spells, you should add my keywords to them (MAG\_MagicDamagePoison and MAG\_MagicDamageSun, respectively). These keywords are injected. You will also need to manually implement Bathed in Light similar to how it was done with Vanilla spells. We have provided a patch for Odin that does this already.
  
  
Pilgrim is compatible with Breton Paladin with the patch provided.
  
  
If you want to add Pilgrim support to your own mod without need of a patch, you can find an article detailing how [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/3324).
