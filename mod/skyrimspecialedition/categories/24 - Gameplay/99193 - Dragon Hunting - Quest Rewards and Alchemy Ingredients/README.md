Dragon Hunting was made to support [Dragon War](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51310) — or any other dragon overhaul — in making dragons way more interesting to hunt and kill.

After killing a dragon — in addition to Dragon Bone and Dragon Scales — you can loot ESO inspired alchemy ingredients, useful to make powerful potions or to be sold to Farengar for a good amount of gold. Ingredients that are body parts instead can only be looted if you have Kahvozein's Fang in your inventory, which can be found anytime in one of the Dragon Priest dungeons of the game.

If you are using [Apothecary](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52130) and the appropriate patch, ingredients are more powerful than the vanilla version.

For a better interaction with the new content, a few changes have been made to a few Blades quests.
  
  
 • **Rebuilding the Blades** - After the completion, Esbern can give you the Blessing of the Blades.
  
 • **Dragon Hunting** - Can be repeated every 24 in-game hours.
  
 • **Dragon Research** - To obtain Dragon Infusion, Esbern now requires Dragon Blood, Dragon Bile and Dragon Rheum.

Quite underwhelming if you are using a dragon overhaul, Blades rewards have been adjusted to give more useful tools to fight against dragons.
  
  
 • **Blessing of the Blades** - Your weapon enchantments are 25% stronger against Dragons for 8 hours.
  
 • **Dragon Infusion** - You take 10% less damage from Dragons.
