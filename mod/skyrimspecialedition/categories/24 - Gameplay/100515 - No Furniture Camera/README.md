 ﻿This is a small plugin that stops the game from transitioning into the furniture camera state, essentially removing it from the game. The game will just use the third person camera instead. After all, furniture camera is just third person camera but... worse?
  
 ﻿ It should make [climbing](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97253) with [animated traversal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63232) a bit smoother and more fun to use. When used together with [True Directional Movement](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51614) it'll result in seamless climbing with full camera control and no camera angle snapping.

* **Legendary Edition version?**

﻿I'm sorry, but no. Special Edition's engine is much more stable and frameworks like CommonLibSSE allow much easier implementation of advanced plugins. It's **really, really** time to move on. However, feel free to try porting the mod to LE if you're up to the challenge. I'd rather spend my time on something else than supporting a much worse and, at this point, absurdly outdated version of the game.
  
  

  
* **Is it compatible with [SE/AE]?**

Yes.
  
  

  
* **Can I install/uninstall this in the middle of a playthrough?**

Yes. The plugin has no lasting impact on your game and can be installed/uninstalled anytime.
