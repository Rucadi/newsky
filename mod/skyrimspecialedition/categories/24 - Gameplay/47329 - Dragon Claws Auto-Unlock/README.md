[LE Version Here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/107040)﻿ | [Xbox One Version Here](https://bethesda.net/en/mods/skyrim/mod-detail/4205957)﻿

Installation:
  

  
* Install with mod manager of choice
Can be placed anywhere in load-order (No Vanilla records edited, conflict-free)
  

  
How It Works:
  

  
* Uses a perk with an Activate Entry Point to automatically solve Dragon Claw Puzzle Doors
If you have the required Dragon Claw simply interact with the keyhole to have it automatically solve itself
  
* Supports 3 solving modes: Sequential (1), Simultaneous (2), Instant (3). Choose the plugin for the desired mode or use the console command: **[font=Courier New]Set DCAUMode to X[/font]** - where X is the desired mode
[size=3][size=3]Provided they use the vanilla scripts; m[/size]od-added puzzle doors can be supported by simply dragging & dropping the Activator record into the [font=Courier New]DCAU\_FormlistDoors[/font] FormID List record from this mod (same for puzzle rings with the ring formlist)[/size]
