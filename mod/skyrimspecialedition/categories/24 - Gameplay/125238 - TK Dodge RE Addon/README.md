[font=Verdana]**Description:**[/font]
  
  
This addon provides a MCM to change:
  
  

  
* The dodge key
dodge stamina cost
  
* the use of sprint key dodging
percentage based stamina cost
  
* a new setting to only attack cancel within MCO recovery frames (MCO is not a requirement, but this setting won't do anything without it installed)

  
The mod is esl flagged
  
dll may work with all Skyrim versions but i only tested it with version 1.6.1170 and 1.5.97.
  
chances are in-between versions don't work.
  
  
The way the dodge cost is calculated is also changed to make it adjustable via perks/spells/potions
  
at the start of the game you get an ability that sticks to you the entire game. the magnitude of the effect of this spell is a multiplier for the stamina cost.
  

  
* **old cost:**

* **new cost:**

check the [article about the settings](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/7159) 
  
  
Perk check for dodging is turned on by default but you can easily set it in the MCM and thanks to MCM helper, you only need to set it once and forget about it
  
I also added a dummy perk to the esp for anyone wanting to make my mod a requirement for a perk mod they work on, so there's no need for ini settings, you can just add my perk into your perk tree and set the MCM setting for perk requirements
  
  
if you leave either of those 2 ini settings empty or assign them wrong, the mod will use my dummy perk as requirement
  
The same is true for the OnDodgeSpell

The script in this mod is only for the MCM, so it should be fairly save to remove the mod mid-game
