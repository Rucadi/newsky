**Description**
  
  
Skyrim Unbound Reborn (SUR) is an alternate start mod with a wide range of options. Instead of starting the game in a cart going to Helgen, going through the whole vanilla intro, reporting to Balgruuf about the dragon, going to Bleak Falls Barrow and fighting Mirmulnir for the 1000th time, it allows you to start the game in a completely different way. And not just one different way: you can choose from plenty of various starting locations, choose your starting armor, weapons, other items, wealth level, spells and standing stone, or keep everything randomized; you can also start as a vampire or werewolf or add a bounty on your head. SUR allows you to create characters with different backgrounds, whose stories in Skyrim start differently. H[size=2][size=2]igh customizability allows you to select the most fitting options for your character's build or background, or keep some or all options randomized. Get a different experience from the game start and increase replayability, keeping the game start interesting.[/size]
  
  
Tired of always playing the one that must save the world? SUR also allows you to play as a non-dragonborn (optionally), without the main quest, shouts and absorbing dragon souls, so you can play as a regular adventurer.
  
  
If you're wondering, what's the difference with other alternate start mods, there are many differences that you may like more or less, but the main ones are:[/size]

  
* Instead of simply choosing one of the available starts, you can customize all aspects of your start: the starting location, armor, weapons, other items, wealth level, spells, whether you're a vampire or werewolf, bounty on your head, and more. You can also keep some or all options randomized.
When you start the game, your quest journal is empty (except for some starting locations). [size=2]There is no predetermined background or objectives for your character, so you can come up with any background and objectives that you want.[/size]
  
* SUR alters the beginning of the main questline. The first few quests are bypassed - you no longer need to report about a dragon in Helgen to Jarl Balgruuf, obtain the Dragonstone for Farengar, defeat Mirmulnir, or even go to Helgen or Whiterun to start the main quest. At some point of the game dragons appear in Skyrim (you can customize when). When you absorb a dragon soul for the first time, you'll be summoned to High Hrotgar by the Greybeards.

Skyrim Unbound Reborn is an updated and significantly reworked version of ﻿[Skyrim Unbound](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6532). There are lots of changes, the main ones are listed in [this article](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/4414).
  
  
  
[size=3]**Game Start**
  
  
You no longer begin the game in a cart going to Helgen. When you start the game, Helgen is already destroyed and you weren't there when it happened, haven't met Ralof, Hadvar, Ulfric or Tullius.
  
  
This is how you start a new game with SUR:
  
  
1. Start a new game from the main menu.
  
  
2. After the intro titles end, the character creation menu opens.
  
  
3. After creating your character, open the Skyrim Unbound MCM (System > Mod Configuration > Skyrim Unbound, the MCM may need some time to appear on heavy modlists) and configure your start as you want. In the MCM you can choose from plenty of various starting locations, choose your starting armor, weapons, other items, wealth level, spells, standing stone or randomize these options. You can choose to start as a vampire or werewolf, set bounty on your head, start as a local inhabitant at your starting location and more. All options have descriptions displayed at the bottom when you hover over them. By default everything is randomized, with special options like vampire/werewolf or bounty on your head disabled.
  
  
 Pay attention to the "Dragonborn" option (on the first page) that defines if you're the Dragonborn or not (random by default). You can always change this option later, though.
  
  
4. Use the "Begin Your Adventure" option on the first page of the MCM to start the game with the choosen settings.
  
  
5. When you finally start the game, your adventure begins with no quests in your journal, you're free to explore the world and do what you want.
  
  
Additional features:
  
[/size]

  
* You can save MCM settings to presets or replace the default preset.
If you want to start with a preset without changing any settings from it, then instead of going into the MCM you can just press the hotkey (Enter by default) and select a preset to quickly start with it.
  
* If you want to preview your starting location and gear, instead of the "Begin Your Adventure" option, use the "Preview Mode" option. After enabling the Preview Mode, you'll see the name, type and hold of your starting location and all your starting items and spells will be given to you. Then you can re-randomize the location with the same or different settings by clicking "Re-randomize" in the MCM. You can see your starting items and spells if you close the MCM. You can re-randomize the inventory with the same or different settings. To re-randomize the inventory, close the MCM, press the hotkey (Enter by default) and choose "Swap Gear".

(Yes, there's no vanilla start option)
  
  
  
[size=3]**Main Quest and Dragons**
  
  
The first few chapters of the main questline are bypassed - you no longer need to report about a dragon in Helgen to Jarl Balgruuf, obtain the Dragonstone for Farengar, defeat Mirmulnir, or even go to Helgen or Whiterun to start the main quest. No questline is forced on you from the game start.
  
  
There's no quest during which you encounter your first dragon. Instead, dragons just start to appear everywhere at some point of the game, which means that you can encounter your first dragon and start the main quest in any area of Skyrim.
  
The game begins with no dragons, Skyrim Unbound delays them depending on the MCM settings. The delay has two stages - dragons at word walls appear after the first stage, and after the second stage dragons start to appear randomly in the world as well. By default each stage lasts 7-21 days. In the MCM you can customize the delay and choose between timed and leveled modes.
  
  
The main questline starts when you encounter a dragon and absorb a dragon soul for the first time - you'll be summoned to High Hrothgar by the Greybeards after a while. The first word of the Unrelenting Force will be learned automatically after this, or you can find it earlier in Bleak Falls Barrow.
  
  
The Bleak Falls Barrow quest (obtain the Dragonstone for Farengar) is available as a side quest (it's not a part of the main questline anymore) - to start it, say "I'm looking for work." to Jarl Balgruuf (you must have at least neutral relationship rank with him).
  
  
Skyrim Unbound allows you to play as a non-dragonborn, without the main questline (including the main questline of Dragonborn DLC) and without the ability to absorb dragon souls and shout. Civil War, The Whispering Door and In My Time of Need can be finished without encountering dragons or being Dragonborn. All vanilla references to you as the Dragonborn in the content that is available to a non-dragonborn are cut out.
  
  
**Q&A:**[/size]

  
* **Can i change the Dragonborn option or the dragon settings after the start?** Yes.
**What happens with Ralof and Hadvar?** At the beginning of the game they are nowhere to be found, but during The Jagged Crown quest you encounter one of them (depending on the side you choose) as usual, except that he won't say that he knows you.
  
* **What's with the Western Watchtower?** The tower is in its initial state and never gets destroyed, all vanilla mentions of the fight with Mirmulnir are cut out.
**What happens with Durhneviir if i'm non-dragonborn?** Durhneviir won't be resurrected if you're non-dragonborn and can't learn shouts.
  
* **How to start The Whispering Door quest?** Instead of the completion of the Dragon Rising quest, The Whispering Door now requires your relationship rank with Balgruuf to be >= 2. You can gain it by completing the prerequisite quest/quests for the Whiterun thane quest that are set in the MCM.

  
[size=3]**Whiterun Thaneship**
  
  
After you complete Bleak Falls Barrow quest, Breezehome will be available for purchase and a dialogue to start a standard thaneship quest (help people of the hold and buy a house to become a thane) will appear.
  
  
In the MCM (on the last page) you can change the prerequisite quest from Bleak Falls Barrow to The Blessings of Nature, either quest or both quests. If The Blessings of Nature is set as a prerequisite quest or one of them, you need to talk to Balgruuf when the Gildergreen tree is repaired/the sapling blooms (he will thank you when you "activate" him).
