[font=Trebuchet MS]**Description:**
  
  
This mod extends the Arthmoor's Alternate Start mod to include locations from Beyond Skyrim: Bruma. After choosing to start from Cyrodill when speaking to the statue of Mara, you will be presented with the seven additional lore friendly choices through the added dialogue options.
  
  
**Features:**
  
  
Start your journey in Bruma by deciding on your path and role:

[font=Trebuchet MS]An aspiring student of the arcane arts who wish to attain greater knowledge by paying pilgrimage to the well-known Synod headquarters, you have finally arrived at the city of Bruma with your trusty staff, scrolls, and spelltomes at your side.[/font]

* [font=Trebuchet MS]A tragic Talos worshipper attempting to escape the dreaded pursuit of Thalmor Justicars, you are left hiding at the Hjalti's Refuge with nothing left but your ragged-tagged robes, a measly few coins, and your beloved Talos amulet.[/font]
[font=Trebuchet MS]A courier who has just been attacked by the local bandits and left for dead with all his possessions taken, you have a tough road ahead of you even if you make it back to the city alive.[/font]

**Incompatibilities:**
  
  
This mod makes no changes to the requisite mods nor any vanilla game files. All scripts and changes are self-contained within the included esp and bsa files. There should not be any conflicts or incompatibilities.
  
  
**Note:**
  
  
Although this is by no means a complex add-on, it is nonetheless my first attempt in creating a mod and tinkering with scripts so somethings probably could have been done in much simpler ways for all I know. However, I have checked multiple times to ensure everything should work as intended. Hope you enjoy this mod!
