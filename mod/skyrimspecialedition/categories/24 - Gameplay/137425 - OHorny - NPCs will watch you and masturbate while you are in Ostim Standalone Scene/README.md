# OHorny - NPCs will watch you and masturbate while you are in Ostim Standalone Scene
- Author: daubuoi
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/137425


When you activate the Ostim scene for yourself, the nearby NPCs will automatically watch you and trigger their own solo scenes.
  
 These NPC scenes will end when your scene ends, and they will climax at the same time as your character.

The MCM configurations include:
  
  

  
* **Allow Females**: Allow activating female actors. ( Excluding children and the elderly )

  

  
* **Allow Males**: Allow activating male actors. ( Excluding children )

  

  
* **Maximum Activation Distance**: Maximum distance to search for NPCs to activate the scene from your character.

  

  
* **Maximum Furniture Search Distance**: Maximum distance to search for furniture from the NPC to activate the scene with that furniture.

  

  
* **Actor Limit**: Maximum number of actors that can be activated.

  

  
* **Actor Relationship Condition**: The condition to use with Actor Relationship Rank. If you choose "Follower Only" the Actor Relationship Rank will no longer be relevant.

  

  
* **Actor Relationship Rank**: Choose to apply the scene based on the relationship level of NPCs compared to your character, used together with Actor Relationship Condition. For example, if the Actor Relationship Condition is "Greater than" and the Actor Relationship Rank is "Friend", it means that NPCs with a relationship level of Friend or higher will be applied.

[size=4]Installing
  
  
Safe to install mid game.
  
  
It is highly recommended to turn off '*End NPC scene on orgasm*' in the *NPC Scenes* section of the *Auto Control* menu in OStim Standalone MCM. This allows OHorny to manage and end NPC scenes properly. If not turned off, the NPC scenes may end before your character's main scene finishes.
  
  
  
Upgrading
  
  
Okay, for those who are using version 1 and are preparing to update to version 1.1:
  
  
Normally, you can just install it as usual without worrying about this, but since version 1.1 fixes quite a few things, there is a possibility (only a possibility) that after you update to version 1.1, it may not work or may not work as expected. I’m not completely sure about this yet because I haven’t had a chance to test it. So if you encounter any issues, I recommend installing it on a clean save file (meaning a save that hasn’t had this mod installed before or one that you’ve cleaned up). You can do this just like how you updated OStim. If you’re not sure how to clean a save file, the method is mentioned in the description of the Ostim Standalone mod under the 'Upgrading' section; just follow the same procedure for this mod.

[size=4]FAQ
  
  
ESP-FE?
  
Of course.
  
  
Can I activate a solo scene for an NPC as I wish?
  
You can use my other mod: [OSolo](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/136712)
  
  
I don't see the NPCs triggering their scenes.
  
Make sure your OStim Standalone version is 7.3.4 or higher, and that you have solo animations.
