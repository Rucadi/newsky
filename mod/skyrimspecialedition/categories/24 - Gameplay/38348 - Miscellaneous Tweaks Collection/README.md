**MISCELLANEOUS TWEAKS COLLECTION**

  
  
This is a small collection of tweaks that I use personally but consider too small for separate plugins. As usual, the mod is primarily intended for users of my guide, The Phoenix Flavour. Some of them already exist in some shape or form, but were missing something or included features I didn't want so I edited or recreated them.

**BETTER HORSES**
  
Spoiler
  
**DESCRIPTION**
  
  

  
* Horses are slightly faster, more maneuverable, and have more Stamina.
Frost and all five buyable horses are set to Protected and can only be killed by the player.
  
* Shadowmere is not set to Protected as (s)he will respawn after dying.
Set the Confidence to 0 (Cowardly) for all generic, unnamed horses.
  
* Frost remains at Confidence 1 (Cautious) and will attack targets weaker than him.
Shadowmere remains at Confidence 3 (Brave) and will attack unless severely outmatched.
  
* Also covers the buyable horses added by the Hearthfire DLC.

  
**COMPLEMENTARY MODS**
  
  
I highly recommend using [Irondusk's Saddlebags](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/91395) alongside these tweaks. It adds a Horse Call power and allows you to store items on your horse by interacting with it when crouched. You can also remove Saddlebag's Horse Call power in xEdit and use [Nether's Follower Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18076) to define a Horse Call hotkey in the MCM.
  
  
**CHANGELOG**
  
  
**1.0** Initial release.
  
**1.1** Resaved to fix some errant form version 40 / 43 headers.
  
**1.2** Buyable horses are now Protected instead of Essential. Added the three Hearthfire horses.
  
**1.3** Slightly increased overall speed and mobility of all horses. Doubled their base Stamina (100 > 200).
  
  
  
  
**NO STARTING SPELLS**
  
Spoiler
  
**DESCRIPTION**
  
  
- The Healing and Flames spells were removed from the player character. This can only be done through a plugin.
  
- Edited one vanilla script so that race-specific spells will not be added to the player in the first place (thanks, Umgak!).
  
  
**COMPATIBILITY**
  
  
The FOMOD installer includes a [AI Overhaul SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21654) compatible plugin. Place the plugin below AI Overhaul.esp in the load order.
  
  
**CHANGELOG**
  
**1.1** Replaced BAT file with edited vanilla script to prevent race-specific spells from being added.
  
**1.0** Initial release.
  
  
  
  
**SHRINES DON'T CURE DISEASES**
  
Spoiler
  
**DESCRIPTION**
  
  
Shrines no longer cure diseases. Includes shrines from the Dawnguard and Dragonborn DLC. **Requires [Adamant - Shrines and Amulets](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30191)**. Vanilla version available in Old Files.
  
  
**COMPATIBILITY**
  
  
~~A patched version for [Trua - Minimalistic Faiths of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32549) is included.
  
Since 1.4, a patched version for the [Adamant Shrines and Amulets Addon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30191) is included.
  
Since 1.5, a patched version for [Wintersun - Faiths of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506) is included.~~
  
  
**I have decided to drop support for all versions except Adamant - Shrines and Amulets.** This is the version that TPF uses, and I don't have the time to maintain files for anything other than TPF. The old FOMOD with versions for vanilla as well as Trua and Wintersun is still available (it's 1.6 in Old Files), however, I have no idea if the Trua / Wintersun versions are still up-to-date with those mods. Please check for yourself in xEdit.
  
  
**CHANGELOG**
  
  
**1.9** Updated for Adamant - Shrines and Amulets 5.0.3.
  
**1.8** Forwarded an error fix for the Shrine of Dibella from Adamant Shrines 5.0.2.
  
**1.7** Updated Adamant version for Adamant - Shrines and Amulets 5.0.1. Other versions are no longer supported.
  
**1.6** Fixed an error in the Trua version (thanks ViktoriaLanders).
  
**1.5** Added Wintersun compatible version by [supinnah](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5443286).
  
**1.4** Added Adamant Shrines compatible version.
  
**1.3** Fixed "All Diseases cured" message still appearing for the Trua version (thanks, Lively.)
  
**1.2** Updated Trua version for Trua 1.0.2.
  
**1.1** Added Trua compatible version.
  
**1.0** Initial release.
  
  
**CREDITS**
  
  
Thanks to [supinnah](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5443286) for the Wintersun version!
  
  
  
  
**BETTER ANCIENT KNOWLEDGE PERK**
  
Spoiler
  
**DESCRIPTION**
  
  
*Was previously available on the Morrowloot Miscellania mod page.*
  
  
- This is a tweak from Morrowloot Ultimate by ChocolateNoodle.
  
- The [Ancient Knowledge](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Ancient_Knowledge_(Skyrim)) perk will now grant a 25% bonus to weapon efficacy in addition to the armor and smithing bonus.
  
  
  
  
**MORE REALISTIC ANIMAL LOOT**
  
Spoiler
  
**DESCRIPTION**
  
  

  
* Animals no longer drop septims, potions, gems, or jewellery.
Animals are no longer affected by the Imperial Luck or Golden Touch perks (only a few were to begin with).
  
* Does not affect Dragons, Giants, Hagravens, Falmer, Were creatures, Rieklings, Dwemer constructs, Skeletons, or Draugr.
Removed bee from the Vacant Beehive container (it's vacant ffs).
  
* Increased amount of bees found in regular Beehives and added the Respawn flag.

  
**CHANGELOG**
  
  
**1.0** Initial release.
  
**1.1** Resaved to fix some errant form version 40 / 43 headers.
  
  
**CREDITS**
  
  
Some ideas were taken from mnikjom's [Container and Levelled List Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26575). Thanks for allowing me to include your tweaks!
  
  
**FUTURE PLANS**
  
  
I might expand the plugin in the future and increase animal drops such as Bear Claws to drop a random amount that is not totally unbalanced like Harvest Overhaul but makes a little more sense than getting the same amount from every kill (something between one and four claws).
  
  
  
  
**OUTFIT TWEAKS**
  
Spoiler
  
**DESCRIPTION**
  
  
- Skjor now wears the Wolf Gloves in addition to the boots and armor.
  
- Jenassa now wears a set of Chitin armor (yay for DLC integration). Idea taken from [Jenassa In Chitin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33950).
  
  
**COMPATIBILITY**
  
  
The FOMOD installer includes a [AI Overhaul SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21654) compatible plugin. Place the plugin below AI Overhaul.esp in the load order.
  
  
  
  
**NIGHT EYE REDUX**
  
Spoiler
  
**DESCRIPTION**
  
  
This is a simple plugin containing a few tweaks combined with TX12001's IMOD fix. I didn't touch the night eye power for Vampires as most people will use other mods to rework them and they usually affect night vision. Basically, night eye is a bit better for Khajiit.
  
  
- Night Eye for Khajiit lasts until it is toggled off (instead of only 60 seconds).
  
- Fixed the quick flash that happens when toggling night eye (bug introduced with SSE).
  
- The night eye effect will also be a little brighter like it was in SLE.
  
- Removed the distracting radial blur effect from the edges of the screen.
  
  
*Note that werewolves don't actually have access to night eye. There is a unique werewolf night eye power but since werewolves cannot access powers when transformed, it's basically useless.*
  
  
**COMPATIBILITY**
  
  
[Scion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41639) uses the vanilla IMOD records for its night eye power and will therefore benefit from the fix and removal of radial blur.
  
  
**KNOWN ISSUES**
  
  
~~When toggling night vision there's a very brief dark flash. I have no idea what's causing it or how to fix it.~~
  
Fix by TX12001 included in 2.0!
  
  
**CHANGELOG**
  
  
**1.0** Initial release.
  
**2.0** Redone from scratch.
  
**2.0.1** Renamed the plugin to have the same prefix, Misc Tweaks, as the others (this annoyed me to no end).
  
  
**CREDITS**
  
  
Thanks to [TX12001](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/6995095?tab=user+files) for figuring out why the weird flash happens when toggling night eye in SSE. Edits (revert to vanilla) from [Original Night Eye IMOD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27160) were included in my plugin.
  
  
  
  
**MORE EXPENSIVE PLAYER HOMES**
  
Spoiler
  
**DESCRIPTION**
  
  
So I was chopping up skepman's fantastic [Economy Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9542) and really liked his tweaks for player home prices. He multiplied all by 1.5 with the exception of Proudspire Manor in Solitude which he deemed expensive enough already. I decided to also leave Breezehome at the vanilla price of 5.000 septims (instead of increasing it to 7.500) so that it remains possible to buy storage for all your stuff early on.
  
  

  
* Breezehome (Whiterun): **5.000 Septims** (unchanged)
Honeyside (Riften): **8.000 Septims** ---> **12.000 Septims**
  
* Vlindrel Hall (Markarth): **8.000 Septims** ---> **12.000 Septims**
Hjerim (Windhelm): **12.000 Septims** ---> **18.000 Septims**
  
* Proudspire Manor (Solitude): **25.000 Septims** (unchanged)
Severin Manor (Raven Rock): **free** (unchanged)
  
* Windstad Manor (Hjaalmarch): **5.000 Septims** ---> **7.500 Septims**
Lakeview Manor (Falkreath): **5.000 Septims** ---> **7.500 Septims**
  
* Heljarchen Hall (The Pale): **5.000 Septims** ---> **7.500 Septims**

  
*Note that only the purchasing costs are affected, not the furnishing prizes.*
  
  
**CHANGELOG**
  
  
**1.0** Initial release.
  
**1.1** Reverted price for Breezehome to vanilla.
  
  
**CREDITS**
  
  
Thanks to skepmanmods for [Economy Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9542).
  
  
  
  
**MORE EXPENSIVE INNS**
  
Spoiler
  
**DESCRIPTION**
  
  
Increases Inn prices per night to 40 Septim (four times the vanilla price) in an effort to make gold a tiny bit more relevant. Since this edits a global, it only works on a new save.
  
  
**CHANGELOG**
  
  
**1.0** Initial release.
  
  
  
  
**DECLUTTERED CRAFTING MENUS**
  
Spoiler
  
**DESCRIPTION**
  
  
Adds conditions to Dwemer Scrap smelting recipes so they only show up if you have at least one piece of scrap in your inventory, thus decluttering the Smelter menu. Also adds conditions to various DLC-added crafting recipes so they only show up after completing the DLC's introduction quest.
  
  
While this plugin only requires the USSEP, it was made with [Simple Smithing Overhaul Simplified](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55333) in the load order, forwarding its changes. Using either SSO or SSOS (the WACCF-less version of SSO) is highly recommended for consistency.
  
  
**CHANGELOG**
  
  
**1.0** Initial release.

**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS**
  
  
**Could you create an All-In-One plugin?**
  
I prefer keeping files separate from each other so no. All of the plugins are ESL-flagged so they won't count toward the 255 ESP/ESM limit. If you like, you can unflag them in SSEEdit and merge them together using the zEdit merging module.
  
  
**Will you be adding more tweaks in the future?**
  
Probably.
  
  
**Could I request a tweak?**
  
If it's something small and plugin-based, sure. No promises though. I'm not actually a very good modder and these tweaks are made primarily for my guide.
  
  
**Why did you remove the Smithing Tweaks module?**
  
~~Because it's got a separate mod page now: [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43441).~~ It's back lol (Decluttered Crafting Menus).
