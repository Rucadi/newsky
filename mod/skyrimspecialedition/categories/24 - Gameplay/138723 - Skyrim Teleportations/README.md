**Overview**
  
Tired of long journeys across Skyrim’s treacherous wilderness? With this mod, you can harness the arcane talents of Skyrim's court wizards to travel instantly across the land. Each hold’s court wizard has mastered teleportation magic, offering a quick and immersive way to reach your destination.
  
This mod is also available on Creation Club.
  
  
**How It Works**
  
Visit the court wizard in the Jarl's palace of any major city. Depending on the city’s political alignment (Imperial or Stormcloak), the wizard will offer to teleport you to other allied cities and even smaller towns within the hold they govern.

**Teleportation to Smaller Towns**
  
Court wizards can also teleport you to smaller towns and villages within the hold they govern, offering convenient access to remote areas.
  
  
**Version 2.0**
  
- added support for Civil war, court wizards can only teleport you to cities that are actually allied with either Empire or Stormcloaks;
  
- Whiterun remains neutral regardless of civil war progress for accessibility sake;
  
- College of Winterhold remains neutral as well.

This mod should be compatible with everything.
