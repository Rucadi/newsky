**Ordinator - Combat Styles**
  
  
**REQUIREMENTS:**
  
Ordinator
  
[Weapon Speed Mult Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45502?tab=description) or something that does the same thing. This is just the one I use.
  
  
**WHAT IT DOES:**
  
This small mod is an add-on for Enai Siaion's Ordinator perk overhaul. It modifies Ordinator's One Handed tree to include additional perks that allow the players to pursue "combat styles." One of the styles, dual-wielding, already exists in Vanilla and Ordinator, and has merely been given some additional perks. The second, single-wielding, is new. It's perks only function when wielding a one-handed weapon and nothing else (torches carry penalties that disappear as you take more perks, while spells disable the perks entirely). It started off as a mod that let me play as an agility and speed oriented fighter, but it's grown a bit, fleshing out the two combat styles that are possible with one-handed weapons.
  
  
This mod was originally made for SPERG on Skyrim LE. I tried to account for the strength of Ordinator's perks compared to SPERG's perks, which were much stronger in general. Because this mod was built on SPERG originally, I had to make some changes to Ordinator's perks Ravage and Unleash the beast. The main change is that Ravage now provides an increase to damage rather than speed, since the theme of this mod is single weapon/speed and dual weapon/damage

Changed Ravage to Dual Weapon Style.
  
Changed Ravage to damage increase rather than speed.
  
Changed Unleash the beast to require One-Handed 80 rather than 90.
  
Normal edition: Adds a weapon speed "buff" to Dual Weapon Style to let Man O'War function properly.
  
  
**INSTALLATION:**
  
Use your preferred mod manager or install manually. Load "Ordinator - Combat Styles.esp" after "Ordinator - Perks of Skyrim.esp". You should probably do a perk reset before installing this mo[color=#ffffff]d if you are using it on a game in progress, just to be safe, especially if you have already taken any of the Ordinator perks that I have modified.
  
**COMPATIBILITY:**[/color]
  
This mod only modifies things that Ordinator itself modifies, so it should be compatible with everything.
  
[Blended Skills](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77775?tab=description) requires a patch, located on that mod's Files page.
