Ever wondered why npcs always seems to have a longer pause between each sentence? Well No more, They are actually talking like people should do now.
  
Every social logic in Skyrim for npcs is changed, they talk more often to each others. And will less likely greet to you from a distance, they will also greet less often too, making them to not act as much as robots. NPCs are also more clever and will know for example if they talked to a npc and will therefore talk to another or not talk at all. After some time, they talk again with each others.
  
Expressions is also overhauled, they express themself when they actually should.
  
Emotions is as well overhauled, You can see how the npcs face look more alive.
  
   
Did you accidently run in to some stuff, and npcs start to yell at you?
  
Well it won't happen as often now, It happen way too often in vanilla.
  
   
This is a must-have mod for anyone that has sound on while playing.
