# Raven Rock Resident Requires Favors
- Author: Enodoc
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

This mod changes the requirements for starting [Served Cold](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Served_Cold), which is the final quest in the Raven Rock questline, to also require completion of a number of Raven Rock's Favor quests, in addition to the two Raven Rock Side Quests which were required already. This makes receiving the accolade of "Citizen of Raven Rock" from Councilor Morvayn the equivalent of receiving Thaneship from Jarls in Skyrim.
  
  
Features
  
  

  
* FOMOD Installer with configurable number of required Favors:[list]
**3 Favor Quests** - This is the same as the vanilla Favor requirement in the minor holds.
  
* **5 Favor Quests** - This is the same as the vanilla Favor requirement in the major holds (or the requirement in the minor holds if you use [Thane Me Slower](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61203)).
**7 Favor Quests** - This is the maximum number of Favors available in Raven Rock.
  

  
[\*]Every [Favor Quest in Raven Rock](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Raven_Rock#Miscellaneous_Quests)﻿ now increases the Disposition of its respective quest-giver.
  
[\*][The Final Descent](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Final_Descent)﻿ now increases the Disposition of [Crescius Caerellius](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Crescius_Caerellius) and [Aphia Velothi](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Aphia_Velothi).
