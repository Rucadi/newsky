Are you bothered by all those ash piles that just won't go away quickly enough? Then this mod is for you. This mod will remove any ash piles after a designated amount of game time whether they be from Reanimate spells, the Disintegrate perk, or even from dead Ghosts and Ice Wraiths. Pre-existing ash piles must be revisited to queue them for deletion.
  
   
There are several versions available in the NMM installer. Each will wait for a different interval of game time before deleting any ash piles.
  
   
If you decide to use a different version later any existing ash piles still in the game will retain their expiration time specified by the version installed when they appeared (I think that's how Papyrus scripts work at least!).
  
   
For reference, the various 'piles' covered are both standard vanilla ash piles, the three different ghostly remains, the ice pile and the remains of Seekers and Ash Spawn from Dragonborn. It shouldn't matter what the actor is that leaves the pile, even mod added actors will work as long as they don't add their own new ash piles/remains.

Note
  
------------------------ 
  
Bethesda (eventually!) fixed ash piles in Oldrim (and therefore SE) so they don't usually hang around forever, but in areas that don't repawn (either because they're set to never do so, or because you keep revisiting them and resetting the respawn timer) I think the ash piles will remain indefinitely. Hence I believe the concept of this mod is still very much valid.

Compatibility
  
------------------------
  
This mod should be compatible with most other mods. Conflicts will occur with any mod that changes ash piles.
  
   
------------------------
  
Installation
  
------------------------
  
Install with NMM and choose from the options, or install manually and pick one of the plugins/ESPs and either the BSA or loose script
  
If you use Wrye Bash, install the loose script and the plugin should be Bashed Patch mergeable.
