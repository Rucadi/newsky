**Die When Killed**
  
The player character in Skyrim does not die when they are killed. This goes against one of the fundemental
  
laws of the universe, according to Shirou Emiya. This mod serves to correct this by implementing a permadeath system,
  
and *only* a permadeath system.
  
  
**How Does It Work?**When the player character dies, their name will be saved to "Data/SKSE/Die When Killed/HallOfTheDead.json". A dialog will show and you will be sent to the main menu. When loading a saved game that had Die When Killed installed, the mod will check HallOfTheDead.json. If the player character's name is in the list, the same dialog shown on death will show again, and you will be sent back to the main menu.
  
  
**Requirements**Die When Killed requires the latest versions of [SKSE](https://skse.silverlock.org/) and [PapyrusUtil](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13048).**[size=4][b]

* Die When Killed will likely pair well with a mod like [Death Alternative](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13264)﻿. Using a mod like that will allow you to live past your first mistake.
Die When Killed can only prevent you from loading saves where the mod has been initialized. For that reason this mod works best on a new game or if you make a save the moment you load the mod.
