[Gopher's Predator Vision mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2777)﻿ is awesome, but the power to activate thermal vision doesn't work. Turns out this is due to a typo in the script that the power triggers to activate the vision. I've fixed the typo and recompiled the script. Source is included. You still need the original mod. As this is a loose file, it will always be loaded after the BSA in the original, so load order doesn't matter.
