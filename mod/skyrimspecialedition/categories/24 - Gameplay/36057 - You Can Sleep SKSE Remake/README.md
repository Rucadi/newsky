Brief :[/b][/font]
  
Orginal [You Can Sleep](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/83820) mod by [underthesky](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/24771599), this is remake with updated offsets, compiled against the latest address library so it's version independent. (> 1.5.39)

**Original Mod Description :**
  
Have you ever been annoyed because of the restrictions Skyrim places on sleeping?
  
Or perhaps because the game prevented you from sleeping even where the rules should allow, because of a bug?
  
  
*This mod was created after spending two nights camping on the cold, hard stone atop the Hall of Attainment and getting attacked by a Dragon because Skyrim was adamant that I was "being asked to leave". It allows you to disable any of these:*
  
  
You cannot sleep in an owned bed.
  
You cannot sleep while trespassing.
  
You cannot sleep while being asked to leave.
  
You cannot sleep while guards are pursuing you.
  
You cannot sleep when enemies are nearby.
  
You cannot sleep while taking health damage.
  
You cannot sleep in the air. (No, I didn't make this one up)
  
This object is already in use by someone else. (Beds only)
  
  
*This also appies to the related wait options*
  
  
All of this is done by modifying game code with SKSE. No spells, powers, hotkeys or menus. Also no scripts, no esp file and (un)installable at any time.

Manual installation: No, it's 2020.
