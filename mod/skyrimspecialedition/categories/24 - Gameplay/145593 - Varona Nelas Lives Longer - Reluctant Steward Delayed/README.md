# Varona Nelas Lives Longer - Reluctant Steward Delayed
- Author: Enodoc
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/145593


This mod changes the requirements for starting [Reluctant Steward](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Reluctant_Steward), which is the first substantial quest in the Tel Mithryn questline, to require completion of the two Favor Quests first - [From the Ashes](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:From_the_Ashes) and [Healing a House](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Healing_a_House) - as well as the first iteration of Neloth's [Heart Stones](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Heart_Stones) quest. This means [Varona Nelas](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Varona_Nelas), the original Steward of Tel Mithryn, will no longer appear dead on the road as soon as you leave the settlement.
  
  
Additionally, some of Neloth's radiant quests are tweaked to be more consistent with other radiant quests.
  
  
Core Features
  
  

  
* You will be able to see Varona's daily life around Tel Mithryn (which was always present in the game code) while you complete the first few quests.
Varona will work at the [Sun Stone](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Sun_Stone)﻿ at night, alongside the other Tel Mithryn residents, before the Stone is cleansed.
  
* Varona will visit Neloth, Talvas, Ulves and Elenya over the course of the day, having conversations with all of them that are usually unheard.
[From the Ashes](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:From_the_Ashes) will start part-way through [Healing a House](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Healing_a_House), rather than starting immediately the first time you leave the Tel Mithryn tower.
  
* [Reluctant Steward](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Reluctant_Steward) will start (and Varona Nelas will be killed) only once [From the Ashes](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:From_the_Ashes), [Healing a House](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Healing_a_House) and [Heart Stones](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Heart_Stones) are completed.
[Drovas Relvi](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Drovas_Relvi) will now change into the Steward's Outfit after arriving at Tel Mithryn.
  

  
Additional Features
  
  
These features were originally going to be part of **House Telvanni Retainer Requires Favors** (as a separate mod), but I decided to put everything together in one file for a more complete Tel Mithryn quest experience, since it would otherwise require editing half the quests again.
  
  

  
* Neloth's radiant quests [Heart Stones](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Heart_Stones), [Telvanni Research](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Telvanni_Research), [Experimental Subject](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Experimental_Subject_(A)), [Wind and Sand](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Wind_and_Sand_(quest)) and [Azra's Staffs](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Azra%27s_Staffs) are now Miscellaneous objectives, like other similar radiant quests, since they do not have enough content to be full Side Quests.
[Azra's Staffs](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Azra%27s_Staffs) will no longer be given before [Reluctant Steward](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Reluctant_Steward) is completed, since it's a personal request for Neloth and therefore doesn't make sense being offered before he trusts you enough to make personal requests.
  
* [Lost Knowledge](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Lost_Knowledge) will now be available after completing [The Path of Knowledge](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Path_of_Knowledge), rather than [The Gardener of Men](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Gardener_of_Men), so you can start finding Black Books earlier.
