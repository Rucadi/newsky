**NPCs are no longer able to bash and can't start blocking while they have low stamina.
  
  
This is compatible with most combat overhauls and animation mods. It only changes the condition of the "BlockingStart" Idle Animation.
  
Version available for [(SJG) Dual Wield Parrying Reimplementation for SSE (Works for Spell Blades as well)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18264)
