It will simply enable some of the radiant quests to take place in locations added by Skyrim Sewers.
  
  
There's little reason to come back to those places, once you've been there and claimed the unique treasures. This mod aims to change that. Now the sewers may be inhabited by Bandits, Vampires, Draugr, Falmers, Hagravens or even Forsworn in Markarth case and you may get sent down there in order to get rid of them.
  
In other cases, those sewers may be holding valuables items and you may have to retrieve them.
  
  
List of vanilla radiant quests that should be working :
  
  
[Trouble in Skyrim](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Trouble_in_Skyrim)﻿[Family Heirloom](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Family_Heirloom)[Fetch me that Book!](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Fetch_me_that_Book!)
  
[Ancient Technology](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ancient_Technology)[Cleansing Light](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Cleansing_Light)[Hunting the Monster](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Hunting_the_Monster)

[Culling the Beast](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Culling_the_Beast)[Protecting the Bloodline](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Protecting_the_Bloodline)In addition to vanilla ones, it should also work with following modded quests :

**LOAD ORDER:**
  
  
Simply load after Skyrim Sewers. Load order for other patches doesn't matter, as none of the known patches to me for Skyrim Sewers is touching these records.
  
  
If you're using [Outlaws Refuges](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8445) with it's patch [Skyrim Sewers - Outlaws Refuges - Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19211) then the quest marker will be pointing to the local outlaws refuges first in order to use it's entrance to enter the sewers. After that, it should be pointing you correctly through the sewers levels to your target.
