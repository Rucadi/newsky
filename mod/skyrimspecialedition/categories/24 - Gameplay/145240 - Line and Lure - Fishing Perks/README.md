**Compatibility**
  

  
* [Simple Fishing Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/103440)﻿ - **Compatible****, patch provided**. Also, added a little feature: [size=3]**Drag Hooks** won't consume bait while you have it on. Load order: SFO -> LLFP. Plugin order: SFO -> LLFP -> LLFP\_SFO\_patch[/size]

  
* [Fishing - Reduced Cut](http://https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80379)﻿ - **Compatible**

  
* [Fish anywhere](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60915)﻿ - **Semicompatible**. All perks will work except [size=3]**Tideborn Sense**. Should be easy to fix, but don't have much interest in doing so right now[/size]

  
* [Fishing Preview](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/107476?tab=description)﻿ - **Compatible**[color=#ffffff], load order: Line and Lure after this mod[/color]

  
* [Immersive Fishing](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/115249)﻿ - **Compatible**, load Immersive Fishing last. [size=3][color=#ffffff]It also makes [Fancy Fishing](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89352) **﻿**[/color]and [Fishing Extension Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/139626)﻿ **compatible** [color=#ffffff]with this mod[/color][/size]

  
* [Completionist](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46358)﻿ - **Compatible, patch provided in its page**

  
**Notes**
  
  

  
* Tree uses vanilla perk points

  
* Perks do not interfere with the completion of the Fishing Creation quests, but do help

  
* I highly recommend using [Fishermen Sell Creation Club Fish](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89208)﻿﻿ / [Producers of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61123)﻿ along this mod, so **Jargon of the Trade** perk is more useful

  
* Fishing skill does not level up by succesfully catching junk, only fish

  
* The time you take to catch something is subject to random variables. [size=3]**Swift Cast** improves casting speed, not catching speed[/size]

  
* **Shiny Baubles** activation disables **Drag Hooks**, and viceversa

  
* A list of fish and junk classified by rarity, biome and weather can be found at the [UESP Wiki](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Fishing_(activity))**﻿**
