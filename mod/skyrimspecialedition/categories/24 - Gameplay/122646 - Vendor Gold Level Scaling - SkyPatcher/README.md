I got the idea for this mod from Dutchj's [Vendor Gold Level Scaling](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/103611)﻿.
  
  
The differences from the original mod are as follows.
  
Added Inn keeper and Street vendor as targets.
  
The vanilla Leveled List has not been modified, so the "Calculate from all levels <= player's level" flag remains in effect.
  
Therefore, the increase in the amount of money possessed per level has been increased to 50%.
