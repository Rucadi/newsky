**What is does this mod do?**
  
All of your silver weapons will now deal extra damage against the undead, without any extra patches!
  
  
Powered by **SkyPatcher**, this mod detects all your silver weapons and tags them automatically, with the **WeapMaterialSilver** keyword. **SkyPatcher** will check the recipes, if the weapons contain silver as ingredient and will then tag them if necessary.
  
  
The vanilla **Silver Perk** is automatically distributed with **SkyPatcher** to the NPCs and not only to the player. Everyone can benefit from silver weapons!
  
  
The vanilla perk equip/unequip functionality has been disabled, as the perk is now global.
  
  
  
  
[size=5]**Install**
  
Install the latest [SkyPatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106659) version.
  
Install this mod.
  
Done!
  
  
**If you are using >>[Immersive Weapons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16788)<<, its highly recommended to install the optional patch, to disable its own version of the Silver Perk. The Silver Perk from Immersive Weapons does only work for the player for no one else.**
  
  
**Uninstall**
  
Just delete the mod at any time. No harm!
