You can activate a bear trap and have the option to put a poison (or potion, maybe you're feeling frisky) on it. This works even with your custom crafted potions/poisons. You can have maximum 10 poisoned bear traps at the same time.
  
  
In game you find not that many bear traps and also you cannot put them in your inventory for later use, so you may want to combine this mod with:
  
  

  
* [Collect Bodies and Bear Traps](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4378?tab=description), does what it says. It also allows crafting bear traps in the forge which is neat! No patch needed, just load my mod after it.
Use this with [Skills of the Wild](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37693), which allows you to collect bear traps. Also my addon for it, so you can [craft them yourself](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106717). No patching is needed.
  
* [Ordinator](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1137)﻿, in the Lockpicking tree has perks to collect and craft bear traps. Optional patch allows this mod to work with Ordinator's bear traps.
[Huntsman - A Hunting Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/83870?tab=description)﻿, also allows collecting, crafting and buying bear traps. Patch is provided.
  
* [Basic Camp Gear](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17492)﻿, patch is provided.
[Tinker's Forge - Smithing Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22595)﻿, solid overhaul of Smithing. You can craft bear traps but it does not allow picking them up. Patch is provided.
