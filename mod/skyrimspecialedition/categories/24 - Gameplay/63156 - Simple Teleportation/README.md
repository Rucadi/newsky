**Highly inspired by mods: [Antique Art of the Aldmeri - Teleportation](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11064),**[Simple Mark and Recall](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3736) and [Return Home - Teleportation Spells - Skyrim SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7148).
  
  
**[font=Comic Sans MS]Description[/font]**
  
[font=Verdana]I have been troubled by the fast travel system in Skyrim especially with mods like Survival mod installed. Forbidding fast travel overall makes it too clumsy to travel, meanwhile, letting it go freely will make you miss many encouters and be immersion-breaking. 
  
  
Many excellent mods such as ones listed above made their great efforts to change that. However I'd have to say it is difficult to find the subtle balance point between “immersion” and “convenience”, and of course, "simplicity". So I made one trying to integrate some of the merits of these mods together. [/font]**[font=Comic Sans MS]
  
  
[font=Comic Sans MS][color=#3c78d8][size=5]---------[/font]
  
[font=Comic Sans MS][color=#1e84cc]Standard Version 1.2.2
  
[/color][/font]---------
  
[/size][/color][/font]
  
[font=Comic Sans MS]1.[/font][font=Comic Sans MS] [/font]**[font=Verdana]A teleportation scroll has been introduced into game, which can be crafted at tanning rack with 100 gold. You can use it to mark UP TO 9 locations for later recalling. [/font]
  
**[font=Comic Sans MS]2. [/font]**[font=Verdana]While used in INTERIOR the scroll will mark the location, in EXTERIOR it will recall you back to one of these marks. So there is only one type of scroll in game. Marking a location will not consume the scroll.[/font]
  
[font=Comic Sans MS]**3.**[/font][font=Verdana]You can only use slot 1 as marker at first, the slot 2~9 will be unlocked accordingly when you own the houses in game (Breezehome, Honeyside, Lakeview Manor.....).
  
[/font]
  
*```
How to unlock:
  
slot 1 - unlocked by default
  
slot 2 - unlocked by owning 1 house
  
slot 3 - unlocked by owning 2 houses
  
slot 4 - unlocked by owning 3 houses
  
slot 5 - unlocked by owning 4 houses
  
slot 6 - unlocked by owning 5 houses
  
slot 7 - unlocked by owning 6 houses
  
slot 8 - unlocked by owning 7 houses
  
slot 9 - unlocked by owning 8 houses
```*[font=Verdana]
  
  
A miscellaneous quest will show you where these mark-1~9 are so you don't need to worry about forgetting which and how many locations you have marked.
  
[/font]
  
[font=Comic Sans MS]**4.**[/font][font=Verdana]A teleportation book can also be crafted at tanning rack in cost of 20 scrolls (Yes, from Diablo II).[/font]
  
[font=Comic Sans MS]**5.**[/font][font=Verdana]After version 1.2, followers will be teleported to you after recalling no matter where they are. [/font][font=Verdana]
  
[font=Comic Sans MS]**6.**[/font][font=Verdana]An optional version has been uploaded for guys who want more convenience, which unlocks all the 9 teleporting slot by default.

[font=Comic Sans MS][color=#1e84cc]Optional Version [font=Comic Sans MS][color=#3c78d8][size=5][font=Comic Sans MS][color=#3c78d8][size=5][color=#1e84cc]1.2.2[/color][/font][/size][/color][/font]
  
[/color][/size][/color][/font]---------
  
[/size][/color][/font]I uploaded an alternative version with more restrictions but also more immersive features:
  
  
1. All slots are unlocked by defaut.
  
[font=Comic Sans MS]2. [/font][font=Verdana]Mark 1 can only be used in INN for location marking, while the other 8 Marks can only be used in PLAYER OWNED HOUSES. In other words, you can mark one settlement inn or 8 player houses once you owned them.
  
[/font][font=Comic Sans MS] [/font]
  
  
  
  
[/size][/font]
  
Hopefully it is convenient and simple enough.
  
  
**[font=Comic Sans MS]Note[/font]**[font=Verdana]
  
1) The marker-tracking quest will show AFTER you firstly use a scroll/spell.
  
2) The scroll can only mark/recall in interior/exterior seperately is not just for convenience, but also for avoiding possible game-breaking usage. Many game scences are triggered in interior which you dont want to jump over, so recall yourself outdoor is necessary and mandatory.
  
3) The scripts are light weight. All the slot-unlock condition and usage-condtion are set in the ESL file instead of scripts thus can be easily modified in your will. [/font]
