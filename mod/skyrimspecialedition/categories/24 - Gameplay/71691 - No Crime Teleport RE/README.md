[font=Trebuchet MS]﻿Overview
  
[/font]After paying a fine to the hold guard, you're warped back to the hold capital for no reason. This plugin fixes that by not letting you warp back.

[font=Trebuchet MS]How's it different from any other mod that stops crime teleportation?
  
[/font]Mods like [No Crime Teleport](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13109) sometimes don't work. It only addresses vanilla teleports by editing vanilla scripts, so if you install any crime related overhauls, guard overhauls, dialogue overhauls, or new location mods, you're still getting warped back.
  
  
This plugin fixes the issue by directly hooking the function warping you back, so it's compatible with every single crime/dialogue/location mod.
  
  
[font=Trebuchet MS]Compatibility
  
[/font]Compatible with everything, including all variations of [Crime Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19647?tab=description).
  
You don't need [No Crime Teleport](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13109)﻿ anymore due to its overlapping feature.
