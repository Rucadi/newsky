Hello everyone!
  
  
I want to preface that Biggie Traits mods is an awesome idea! I absolutely love the idea of customizing your character to be different than others, like in fallout series, and not just copy-pastes of previous ones with only main difference being perks.
  
I was creating this mod initially only for myself, and my highly modified versions of SimonRim suite of mods, which I found to be just around my alley - simple, straightforward and impactful without introducing gimmicks or exploits. I downloaded the original Biggie Traits mod and quickly realized that it is more suited for Requiem and not for my load order. So I started editing the traits and changed some images to my personal tastes in order to fit the rest of the theme in my load order better. The end result was very satisfactory (for me) and I just recently decided to share my creation with others who might also want a different approach with trait effects. Some traits were removed as I didn't like the gimmicks/theme they introduced, but there are also some new ones!
  
It might not resonate with everyone, but I believe they are more broadly applicable (and perhaps even more fun to use!) for other modlists and less punishing/gimmicky in some aspects (again, this is my subjective opinion and not a fact).
  
  
So without further ado, **the changes:**
  
  

  
* **Addict**: Changed stagger chance to 15%.
**Adrenaline Rush**: Changed health threshold to 50% and stamina regeneration to 50% instead of flat amount per second.

* **Bad Natured**: Removed perk in favor of new ones.

**Defiler**: Renamed to Cutthroat, changed text flavor and added new art.
  
* **Disbeliever**: Removed.
**Disciplined**: Buffed damage 20->25% to match slower draw speed. Fixed to work only with bows as was unable to fix reload time for crossbows.

**Way of the Voice**: Lowered shout debuff from 30%->25%
  
* **Witcher**: Renamed to Alchemical Affinity and buffed potions and poisons 20%->25%

**Installation:**1. Download original Biggie Traits mod and all dependencies using a manager of choice.
  
2. Download and install this mod with said manager.
  
3. Load after original mod.
  
  
  
**Procedure to reset traits:**
  
**1)** Open console and type the following: **player.additem FE2730CE 1** or type **help slate** to find ID of '*Potion of Blank Slate*' or look up ID under Ingestibles in xEdit.
  
This will grant you a potion that will remove all traits (unfortunately, Master of Warfare trait's bugged debuffs can only be removed on new game if you didn't pick it prior to updating to 1.21 version of the mod). Drink the potion.
  
  
**2)** In console again, type the following: **player.addspell Traits\_SelectionSpell**
  
This will grant you the power to pick traits again (can be buggy if used prior to 1.21 if you had Master of Warfare trait again...). Use the power to pick any trait. I tested it with 2 scripted traits; Giantkin and Fleet-Footed, and both were properly added/removed on new game.
  
  
***3)** (optional)* If you wish to change traits again after the first reset, the power will be locked in power menu for some reason, so you will need to remove it and re-add it again.
  
Type in console: **player.removespell Traits\_SelectionSpell** and repeat steps **1)** and **2)**.
  
  
Remember to always save before messing with console stuff just in case something doesn't go right.
  
  
*Side Note 1:*
  
If you wish to add the removed traits back and/or alter them yourself, all you need to do is open xEdit, look at the two Form ID lists and drag and drop the missing ones from original mod into this one. That's it.
  
On the flip side, if you wish to remove some traits I added, simply remove them from aforementioned two Form ID lists.
  
In fact, if you wish to edit any trait, you can easily open them in xEdit and tweak any values to your liking. They are very straightforward and easy to understand what they do.
  
  
*Side Note 2:*Regarding **Oblivion Attuned** trait, the half duration on some very specific spells can be wonky, specifically spells that leave stuff on the ground as a part of effect. For instance, Mysticism's Circle of Strength/Wisdom/Healing spells will leave lingering visuals on the ground even though the spell itself has faded and does nothing anymore. Just have that in mind to expect oddities with some spells when using this particular trait with some spell packs.
  
  
*Side Note 3:*Honestly, I'm unsure how **Brutal** Trait will work with other perks that add critical strike chance or double it under some circumstances as I'm not that knowledgeable with how the engine interacts with critical strike stacking. But, this is why it is explicitly restricted to wielding axes and blunts; Adamant (main perk overhaul that I use) only adds critical strike chance perks to swords, daggers and greatswords type weapons and to none other. It also makes more sense for fantasy brutes to use brutish weapons, so thematically it should be fine as-is. What I do know however, is that in vacuum, this trait does exactly what it says in description. I tested all the new traits personally several times.
  
  
*Side Note 4:*
  
Regarding **Old-Fashioned** trait, I inspected the original trait via KID file and its positive effects also apply to leather, forsworn, imperial, stormcloak and scaled materials (but not dragonscale).
  
  
*Side Note 5:*
  
Regarding **Growing Legend** trait, don't be alarmed if you don't automatically gain the promised stats on level up. The script tied to it is made to be as lightweight as humanly (or machinely?) possible, so it will check on your level every 15 seconds, when you will get a message that the level up bonus was granted. As a matter of fact, I added several traits with scripts on the last few updates, but all should be super lightweight and shouldn't impact script processing in any meaningful way at all.
  
  
*Side Note 6:***Wild Mage**... As the name implies, this is going to be a highly unpredictable wild ride. All sorts of spells can go off (around 20-ish in total). Every 5 seconds with any spell equipped and readied (hands out) has 10% chance to cast one of spells from the list. Let me know if this is too much triggers and if it needs lowering. Just don't forget to put your hands away or you might cause a havoc in cities... Or maybe that was your goal all along?
  
IN ADDITION:
  
You can add your own spells to the list that can trigger by opening Biggie Traits - Refitted -> Magic Effects -> Traits\_WildMageTrigger -> Under VMAD open script Array Property -> Right click on Array of Object and press Add -> Select spell you want from any source, vanilla or modded on the newly created object. Create or remove as many as you like. The script attached to it randomly selects any spell from this Array, not matter how many there are. Experiment at your own discretion.
  
  
*Side Note 7:*
  
About **Shadowborn**, I left notifications as magical buffs or debuffs to indicate whether you are in bright light (getting debuffed) or in darkness and able to get invisibility trigger. But for some reason, the duration of these indicators seems to stack over time. This serves no game purpose and I don't know why that is so, but if somebody can tell me how to simply keep it at 1 second duration or similar at all times, let me know.  
  
  
*Side Note 8:*When it comes to **Surgebound,** 30% extra magnitude is granted only if your magicka is at or above 50% when the spell was RELEASED, so bear that in mind. You will need a large pool of magicka to get the most benefit out of this trait.
  
  
*Side Note 9:***Chaotic Luck** seems to have an additional side effect that was completely unpredictable: your attack damage stats from weapons might keep changing depending on RNG when inspecting the weapon, but you can quickly realize which stat is the correct one by a mouse-over movements from and on it. Nothing I can do to fix it since it's an engine-level issue and will have to call it a feature bestowed by Sheogorath himself. 
  
  
*Side Note 10:*There have been reports of **Alchemical Affinity** (renamed **Witcher** trait from original Biggie Traits mod) acting strangely, whose widget can stay bugged on the UI indefinitely once the bug occurs. Removing the trait also removes the widget but the bug can happen again. The solution for the problem would be to remove the bugged widgets by going to original mod folder **(Biggie Traits)-> Interface-> Exported-> Widgets** and deleting WitcherToxicityWidget.swf. It's not the most elegant of solutions but at least you will be rid of the bugged widget.
  
  
*Side Note 11:*
  
If you have additional modded crossbows, you can add them to the list provided in the patch so that they also work as intended with ranged traits.
  
  
Huge shoutout to [shazdeh2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/43518332) for creating the original mod!
