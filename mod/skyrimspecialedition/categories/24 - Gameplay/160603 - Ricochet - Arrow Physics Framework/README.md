> **Ricochet - Arrow Physics Framework is a complete overhaul of projectile behavior**, rebuilt directly within the game engine, with **no plugins or scripts required**. It introduces an intelligent **ricochet system**, allows projectiles to **break both visually and physically**, and completely **redesigns the impact physics** of arrows and bolts. An **automatic retrieval system** is also included, letting you seamlessly **collect nearby projectiles** for a smoother and more practical gameplay experience.
>   
>   
> The mod provides **real-time global modifiers**, allowing you to adjust parameters such as arrow speed, gravity, and the maximum number of visible projectiles, whether stuck in enemies or scattered on the ground. Broken arrows and bolts can be **recovered, reforged, or sold**.
>   
>   
> Everything is **fully configurable** through a clear **INI file** or an **optional comprehensive MCM menu**. As a framework, Ricochet also enables mod authors to **easily integrate custom visuals for broken arrows** and other unique projectile effects, **without creating a direct dependency** on the framework itself, using a simple JSON-based system.

Here are some of the key features of the Ricochet Framework:

Enable realistic ricochets for arrows and bolts. Customize speed thresholds, bounce angles, restitution, and damage scaling. Visual and sound effects make every ricochet feel immersive and responsive.
  
  
**Learn more about how ricochets work:**
  
SpoilerThis part isn't purely realistic, though it's not completely out of the realm of possibility either. The ricochet system was designed to be both **believable and fun**, without going overboard into arcade-like behavior. When an arrow strikes a surface, the mod analyzes several parameters to determine what happens next.
  
  
The angle of impact is key. An arrow fired almost straight into a hard surface will usually just fall flat, possibly bouncing back slightly toward the shooter if it has a bit of remaining energy. On the other hand, if the arrow hits at a more shallow angle, it has a good chance of rebounding and ricocheting off. Speed also plays a major role. **A slow arrow won't have enough energy to ricochet, while a fast, powerful shot can slide or bounce depending on the situation.** Finally, the material of the surface is taken into account. **Arrows won't ricochet off soft surfaces like dirt or wood** but are much more likely to do so on stone or metal.
  
  
**Each ricochet causes the arrow to lose some energy**, which translates into reduced speed and damage. All of this is fully configurable in the included INI file, allowing you to **fine-tune the behavior to your liking** and even create over-the-top setups like infinite ricochets if that's what you're into.

Manage arrow breakage on impact. Set fracture probability, surface-specific modifiers, speed thresholds, and angle multipliers. Additional sound and visual effects can be enabled for broken arrows, which can be recovered or reused.

Redefine projectile behavior during collisions. Configure linear and angular impulses, stickiness, and arrow mass to achieve realistic impacts, whether frontal or glancing.

Designed as a framework: mod authors can easily integrate their own visuals for broken arrows and other effects through JSON files without creating a direct dependency on the mod.

Ricochet integrates seamlessly with all other mods. It does not overwrite any base game files, avoiding potential conflicts.

This mod **requires [Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE64)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30379) (any version) and [Address Library for SKSE Plugins](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444) to function**.
  
  
If you plan to install the optional MCM plugin, you'll also need [SkyUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12604) to configure the mod through the MCM.
  
  
Although the framework is fully independent and most of its features work out of the box, the projectile fracture system requires specific visual and sound assets (and therefore a plugin, unlike the framework) as well as JSON instruction files that the framework will interpret. **The community will likely create these assets for their mods.**
  
  
For my part, I designed and recommend a mod that covers all arrows and bolts from the base game and DLC: [Broken Feathers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/160798)

The mod can be installed like any other mod **via a mod manager** or manually. Fractured arrow packs follow the same procedure.
  
  
⚠️ **Note: As explained in the prerequisites section, while most of the mod's features work out of the box, the arrow fracture system requires specific assets to be installed. Make sure to install at least one asset pack if you want to retain this feature.**
  
  
**Manual Installation :**
  
Spoiler1. Download the latest version of the mod.
  
2. Open the archive using [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org) or [Winrar](https://www.win-rar.com).
  
3. Place the **entire contents** of the archive into the **"Data" folder** of your game.
  
(Default: C:\Program Files\Steam\Steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition\Data)
  
4. Launch Skyrim and envoy!

಄ Can the mod cause slowdowns?
  
No, the mod is designed for high performance and will not cause slowdowns, as everything runs in real-time via the game engine.
  
  
಄ Do I need to tweak the mod myself to enjoy it?
  
No, I have already fine-tuned every variable to ensure that each feature provides a good balance between fun and realism. It is therefore very likely that you won’t need to change the default settings (maybe one or two variables at most) to enjoy the mod.
  
  
಄ Does the mod alter the damage system?
  
Only in the case of ricochets: by default, damage is proportional to the final velocity. You can still customize the calculation method to increase or decrease damage.
  
  
಄ Does the mod work with all versions of the game?
  
Yes, the mod works without issues on all versions of Skyrim, including VR.
  
  
಄ Is the mod compatible with [XYZ]?
  
Yes, Ricochet is compatible with absolutely all your other mods, without exception.
  
  
಄ Is the mod compatible with mods that modify arrows?
  
Yes, all modifications made by Ricochet operate at the core engine level, preventing any conflicts with other arrow-related plugins.
  
  
಄ Arrows do not break even though the fracture feature is enabled and properly configured.
  
The most likely cause is that you do not have an asset pack for your arrows. The framework does not include assets; it is a tool provided to players and modders to allow precise design and installation of the elements they want. Personally, I have covered all arrows in the game and DLCs via my mod Broken Feathers. Make sure that it is properly installed.
  
  
಄ The MCM does not appear in the menu.
  
This is probably because you did not install the optional file that provides this functionality. By default, the mod works without a plugin and remains fully configurable via the INI file. You can, however, choose to install the MCM by downloading the archive from the "Optional" section in the download tab.

*“ [size=3][i]I'm a modder and I want to create assets for Ricochet's fracture system!* ”[/i][/size]

  
  
Great! To create custom fracture assets for arrows and bolts, **follow these steps**:
  
  

* **Create AmmoMapping entries**: Define the original projectile, its durability, the broken item, and the possible broken states.
**Create FractureMapping entries**: Set the conditions under which the projectile can break using filters, and link it to the appropriate AmmoMapping.
  
* **Test in-game**: Check that fracture conditions, visuals, and sounds behave as expected, and tweak filters or modifiers if needed.

  
**Filters** let you control fracture behavior based on weapon type, projectile type, impact material, velocity, whether the arrow sticks and more.
  
**Modifiers** allow you to define extra visual effects, sounds, and additional projectiles spawned when an arrow breaks.
