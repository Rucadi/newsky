# Creation Club - Adjustments Rebalancing and Variants

I love a great deal of the Creation Club. It's a ton of fun to see the return of old artifacts from previous games, some of the new armors are gorgeous, and a lot of quests are great additions to the game. My big problem with CC content, however, is stat bloat. Many of the new armors and weapons are just numerically superior to vanilla items, which forces the player to use the new items if you really want to maximize your character. Instead, I feel that the new equipment should be alternatives for their vanilla counterparts, giving players more options for their gearing choices. I also feel that some of the reintroduced artifacts lost a bit of their old flavor from their original titles, and I wanted to see their cool old effects without boosting my stats too high. So, I made this collection of mods intended to balance the new CC items around vanilla items and provide some additional flavor to their effects.

* All files are contained in a FOMOD installer, and are ESL-flagged ESPs, so they will not take a slot from your 255 plugin limit

Installation:
  
These mods are best installed on a new save, as changes to enchantments will not be maintained if you have already disenchanted unique items. I do not recommend uninstalling these at any time during a playthrough, and will be unable to provide any troubleshooting assistance if you decide to do so.
  
  
Compatibility:
  
As of Version 6.0 of the Unofficial Skyrim Creation Club Content Patch, all of these mods are compatible. You will need to install these patches after UCCP in order to maintain balance changes, but there should be no problems with consistency, as appropriate UCCP changes have been forwarded.
