[center]I love DVA. It has been one of my favorite vampire mods since it launched back in 2013.
  
The original author Aipex8 said they would port the mod by Dec 2013, but life happens and it was never ported.
  
  
**I reached out to Aipex8 and got permission to port it over**. (Proof shared with the admins of the site already).
  
Aipex8 is done modding for the time being and won't return (probably) until TES6.
  
  
I will keep the port safe until their return and hand over the mod if they ever want it back. Thank you, Aipex8! 
  
I do not intend to fix bugs or make compatibility patches at the moment.
  
I'm just hosting it with their permission, but you're welcome to patch stuff.

DVA dynamically changes the appearance of vampire players to visually represent the different stages of vampirism. DVA makes other visual changes such as glowing eyes in combat and when using vampire night vision, as well as blood around the mouth after feeding. DVA is also fully customizable via MCM.

Now, here's a blast from the past.
  
*HELLO AND WELCOME TO BRODUAL*
  
  
  
**COMPATIBILITY**
  
  
﻿It should work with any vampire overhaul mods that stick to a four stage system.
  
  
It works fine with the vampire mods I've tested.
