Have you ever stolen something that you wanted to keep for yourself, without risking guards taking it when you get caught? After joining the thieves guild you can go to the fences of the guild (Tonilia is the first fence you come across) and ask them to "clean up the origin of items". A menu shows up, you can select your stolen items, pay the fee and bam!- item is not stolen anymore.
  
This mod preserves the enchantments or the tempering you've done on said item.
  
  
The service by default is only available to the members of the thieves guild. You can turn this off in the MCM, so that you can access this even without having to join them.
  
  
The cost of this service by default is 200 gold per item, plus half of the "base" price of the item (price of enchantments on the item not included). This can be customized in MCM.
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
This mod does not touch any vanilla record. Should be compatible with all mods, including mods that add new fences to the game.
