Description:**
  
This mod expands on the original Hearthfire Multiple Adoptions mod, **allowing you to send each child to their own separate homes**, a revamp on the adoption system which will now easily allow **adding in more children slots for adoption (6 to 8!**), **CC home support**,  and numerous bug fixes.
  
  
esl-flagged.
  
**Requirements:**-SKSE
  
-Hearthfire Multiple Adoptions
  
  
**Installation:**-This mod can be installed on an existing save as long as you have not hit the adoption limit (2 in vanilla, 6 in the original mod). If you're installing it on an existing save where you've already adopted children, it's best to install it on a save where **you're not in the same location as your adopted children**!
  
  
-**Do not install this mod on a save where you have hit the adoption limit!** It won't work! Vanilla adoption logic shuts down quests and states when you've hit the limit! This has been changed with this mod 
  
  
-If you're using the **Prince and the Pauper Refine patch**, have Prince and the Pauper (original mod) load before Hearthfire Multiple Adoptions, then have Prince and Pauper Refine load after that, then this mod + the HMA Prince and Pauper Refine Patch after that.
  
  
-If you're using the **expanded AI Tweaks patc**h, you don't need the original AI tweaks patch from the original Hearthfire Multiple Adoptions mod. Don't use the old patch!
  
Features:
  
  

  
* Each child now has its own unique aliases and packages so they can have their own individual homes as opposed to everyone shares one home
The adoption system has been re-worked so now it can easily support more adoptions.  The initial release adds 2 more, allowing 8 in total
  
* Creation Club homes are now supported (ty Jake Alaimo)
The original HMA mod packed the voice files in the wrong BSA format, causing silent voice lines.  They are now loose files now.
  
* Certain dialogues have been corrected with the right names and conditions
each Child will say locational dialogue now depending on their own separate homes
  
* The adopted critter and pet will now move with the associated child that adopted them
if you kill the critter or pet, now only the associated child will be mad, and not all of them
  
* Each child now has their own chest which is filled sporadically, if possible if the house they are in have enough child chests.
The moving function has been improved and now offers a notification once the child has properly moved into their new home.
  
* Unofficial patch fix adapted to fit new system, for bed ownership of hearthfire homes if certain wings aren't built yet.
Prevent child name calling scene if a family move is queued, since it teleports them to markers in the current home and locks them into a scene there
  

  
  
  
**Things to note:**
  
  
-in the original HMA mod, the adoption move was triggered off a location change.  This still applies, and the kids will teleport to their new home on certain conditions (i.e. making sure you're not at the same location as the child or the child's destination in order to move them properly off-screen) on location change.  This is best triggered off of fast travel, however it isn't necessary.  There will be a notification that the kids moved either successfully or failed to their new home.  Upon failure, the script will do another attempt on  your next location change.
  
  
-The spouse and children move logic are now separated, so they won't move as one anymore. If you want the spouse to move, you will have to ask them individually
  
-The name calling event currently only happens if child1 and child2 (first two adopted) are in the same location. This is behavior from the original mod.
  
-Building a hearthfire home will now no longer automatically move in the family.
  
**Compatibility:**
  
  
-Works with Honorhall Orphanage Bugfixes and Expansion
  
-Hearthfire Extended is compatible (doesnt need a patch)
  
-There is a patch for Fertility Mode Fixes and Updates
  
-Multiple Floor Sandboxing is compatible.<https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4524>-There is a patch for the Hearthfire Multi Adoptions Last Name esp
  
-ORomance Plus, download the HMA patch in the ORomance Plus Patchhub: [Official ORomance Plus Patch Hub at Skyrim Special Edition Nexus - Mods and Community](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/135675)
  
-Issues can occur if you use a mortal children mod and one of your adopted children dies. This is not supported
  
-[Hearthfire Extended Multiple Adoptions Patch at Skyrim Special Edition Nexus - Mods and Community](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67561) is not compatible, it's not updated to work with my mod and taking a look at it, it's not even necessary for Hearthfire Extended to be compatible. Superfluous patch.
  
-Adoption Spouse and Moving Fixes is not compatible. Most of the fixes mentioned in that mod have been implemented or imported in, since the entire adoption moving system has been rewritten.
  
-[Improved Adoptions at Skyrim Special Edition Nexus - Mods and Community (nexusmods.com)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4713) is not compatible currently.
  
-Custom voiced children are not currently compatible (i.e. Interesting NPCs)

-[Marriage Mod - To Have And To Hold at Skyrim Special Edition Nexus - Mods and Community (nexusmods.com)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8589) not compatible (mod is  buggy)
  
-[Adopt Aventus Aretino - Fully Voiced Patch at Skyrim Special Edition Nexus - Mods and Community](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86082) not  compatible, uses the same records for its own purposes.
  
  
  
**Future Plans:**
  
-More children slots!
  
-More integration with other mods
  
-Allow adopting more than 1 critter and pet
