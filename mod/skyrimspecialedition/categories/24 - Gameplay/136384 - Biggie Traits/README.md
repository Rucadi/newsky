This mod adds a host of new traits, inspired by Fallout New Vegas, with the goal of creating new and fun playstyles.
  
  
  
**How It Works**
  
At the beginning of the game you're given a power "Select Traits", activating it displays the menu where you can pick up to 2 desired trait. If you install the addon for Alternate Start - Live Another Life, the menu is displayed automatically after you leave the opening cell.
  
  
  
**List of traits**
  
Spoiler
  

  
* **Addict**: You've developed some bad habits. Skooma and alcohol benefits last 2x as long and you can craft skooma at cooking pot. When not under the effects of alcohol or skooma, you have a 25% chance to get staggered when hit. (Requiem only)
**Angler**: Your bond with the sea grants unique benefits. Mudcrabs and slaughterfish become friendly toward you. Fishing yields more valuable items. Fishing rods deal double damage and have a chance to summon a mudcrab to fight at your side. The summoned mudcrab becomes stronger if you're carrying an insect or small fish. Fishing rods can be enchanted. However, your affinity with the waters leaves you 25% more vulnerable to shock damage.
  
* **Au Naturel**: Embrace your divine gifts! Start with <+100> health, magicka, and stamina. For each piece of armor or clothing you wear, you lose <40> from each attribute (up to a maximum loss of <-160> with four pieces equipped). Additionally, you gain +1 to health, magicka, and stamina per level for each empty armor slot (head, chest, hands, and feet).
**Light Foot**: You've never felt comfortable in footwear. When not wearing boots/shoes, your movement is muffled, you move 5% faster and suffer half fall damage. When wearing boots/shoes you move 10% slower.
  
* **Unbound Hands**: Handwear constricts you. Spells are 15% stronger and unarmed attacks do +15 more damage (30 in Requiem) when not wearing gloves/gauntlets. However, they suffer the opposite effect when wearing gloves/gauntlets.
**Glutton**: You LOVE food but hate medicine. Food benefits are 100% (Requiem: 25%) stronger but potions have only 50% their efficiency.
  
* **Swimmer**: You prefer life on the water. In water, you swim 20% faster, can breath underwater and regenerate health, stamina and magicka by a flat 0.25 per second. On land, you suffer 50% less health, stamina and magicka regeneration.
**Good Natured**: You have a good heart. Deal 20% less damage with weapons and Destruction spells. However, while wearing an amulet of the divines beneficial spells and potions last 20% longer and you take 20% less damage.
  
* **Bad Natured**: You were born into wickedness. Your attacks while sneaking deals 20% more and you're better at pickpocketing. However, your non-sneak attacks do 20% less and wearing a divine amulet will hurt you.
**Druid**: Druids are attuned to nature, making spriggans friendly and reducing the cost of druidic spells by up to 30%. You can craft Lifebloom Essence from Taproot and Spriggan Sap for powerful regeneration. However, your bond with the wild leaves you 25% more vulnerable to fire and axes.
  
* **Hoarder**: You love carrying stuff around, even if it's junk. Gain +100 carryweight. Selling prices are 50% worse.
**Jack of All Spells**: But master of none. Novice, Apprentice and Adept spells are 20% stronger or longer lasting, expert and master spells are 20% weaker or shorter.
  
* **Old Fashioned**: If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Weapons, armor, and magical staves made of iron, wood, steel, fur or hide are 25% stronger. Otherwise, they are 10% weaker.
**Fast Shot**: You'd rather shoot fast than shoot hard. Bows draw 30% faster, crossbows reload 30% faster. However, bows and crossbows deal 30% less damage.
  
* **Giantkin**: Descended from the mighty giants; you gain +10% magic resistance and damage with blunt weapons, however you cannot read skill books, or use scrolls and staves.
**Disciplined**: Shoot to kill. Bows and crossbows deal 20% more damage. However, they draw/reload 25% slower.
  
* **Adrenaline Rush**: You possess a natural flight response. When at less than 20% health, you move 20% faster and regenerate 0.5 stamina per second but also deal 20% less damage when below this threshold.
**Rage**: You posses a natural fight response. When at less than 20% health, you deal 20% more damage and take 20% less damage. However, you move 20% slower when below this threshold.
  
* **Focused**: When in danger, you think before acting. When at less than 20% health, you regenerate 0.5 magicka per second and absorb 10% of incoming spells. However, you take 10% more damage when below this threshold.
**Soul Reaver**: You've claimed countless souls for your gain. Weapon and armor enchantments are 10% stronger and use 10% less charge. Armor rating and weapon damage is reduced by 10%.
  
* **Bane of the Wicked**: You are an enemy to all things abhorrent. Deal 20% more damage to undead, daedra and werewolves. However, do 10% less damage to other beings.
**Defiler**: The only use you have for the living is to resurrect them in death. Deal 20% more damage to playable races. However, do 10% less damage to other beings.
  
* **King of Worms**: You've gained hidden insight into necromantic arts. You can have 1 additional summon or undead thrall. However, the duration of summon and resurrecting spells is reduced by 50%.
**Pacifist**: When your arms are lowered you restore 1 magicka and stamina per second. However, raising your hands in combat will have the opposite effect.
  
* **Bulwark**: When walking or standing still, you gain 100 (Requiem: 200) armor rating and reflect 10% physical damage. You drain 1 additional stamina per second while sprinting and 0.25 points of stamina when running.
**Gambler**: You go in all or nothing. Gain 40% chance to critical hit. However, overall weapon damage is reduced by 25%. When you land a critical hit, your attacks do 10% more damage for 30 seconds (stackable up to 5 times).
  
* **Skilled**: reading skill books grants an extra skill point and trainers cost 50% less, however every 5 levels you don't gain a perk point.
**Dovah Tinvaak**: You are fluent in Dragon speech and as such can shout 30% more often, at 30% reduced effectiveness.
  
* **Way of the Voice**: You follow the pacifist creed of the Greybeards, and as such your non-hostile Shouts have 20% chance to reset the shout cooldown, while your hostile shouts are 30% less effective.
**Elemental Conduit**: Fire spells are more powerful in sunny weather but lose potency in the rain. Shock spells are enhanced during rain but are less effective in snowy conditions. Frost spells excel in snowy weather but weaken under sunny skies.
  
* **Marathon Runner**: You regenerate 10 (5 in Requiem) stamina per second while sprinting. However, you will not be able to gain any stamina while running or standing still.
**Master of Destiny**: You reject the influence of fate and star signs. Standing Stones cannot be used, but you begin the game with 3 additional perk points and a permanent +5 boost to all skills.
  
* **Disbeliever**: You reject the influence of gods, placing your faith in logic and reason instead. Dwemer weapons and armor are 25% stronger, but you cannot receive blessings from shrines or divines.
**Homeowner**: You've secured a place to call your own, choosing one of Skyrim's fine homes to settle in. However, comfort comes at a cost: each week, you must make a mortgage payment based on the home's value.
  
* **Lurker**: When not wearing any clothes sneak attacks deal 2.5 times more damage and can sneak 25% better. Eating fish when it's raw and wriggling triggers a powerful healing effect that lasts <10> minutes, and you're 100% immune to disease. However, armor provides no protection, cooked food offers no benefits, and weapons with a weight above 10 will deal no damage.
**Witcher**: Potions and poisons you craft are 20% more effective, and consuming raw ingredients grants double the effect. However, you can only benefit from up to four active potion effects at a time.
  
* **Introvert**: You thrive in solitude but falter in the crowd. When facing three or fewer enemies, you deal 15% more damage, whether with weapons or Destruction magic. Against four or more, your nerves get the better of you, and you deal 10% less.
  
  
  

**Showcase**

  
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
This mod makes a few edits to a handful of ingredients/food items (skeever meat & skooma) and some scripts. Should be compatible with everything, but best check in xEdit.
  
 Mod is ESP-FE (with ESL flag) so it does not take up a slot in your load order.
  
  
  
  
**FAQ**
  

  
* **Can I remove a trait I've picked?** You can do so by going to the Magic > Active Effects tab and hover over a trait you don't want, then press the R key to remove it. This requires having a dragon soul however.
**Can I add my own traits?** Yes, there's a tutorial, look for it under the Misc files.
  

  
  
  
**Recommended Mods**
  
If you're not using Requiem, highly recommended to use following mods (or mods that achieve similar things):
  
[Gourmet - A Cooking Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/96876?tab=description), to make the Glutton trait worthwhile.
