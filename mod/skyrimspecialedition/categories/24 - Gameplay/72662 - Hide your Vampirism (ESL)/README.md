[font=Tahoma]I like the idea of being a vampire without descending to the utter depravity of the Volkihar Clan, so here it is. Think of it as being an avenger that adopts the weapons of her enemies. Or perhaps someone who thinks vampires like those need to be put down. Or perhaps you're like Blade. Be creative. Have fun with it.
  
  
And also, I never liked the fact that NPCs identified you as a vampire immediately when you enter combat, so now they only do if you are Blood Starved.
  
  
  
So essentially the features are:
  
  
- Pass Isran's test unscathed and undetected if you're fully fed. You're a vampire who knows how to hide your inhumanity when you're at your strongest.
  
- Deceive Dawnguard members by hiding your immortality as long as you remain well fed. Or perhaps you're like Alucard and they tolerate you as long as you control yourself (i.e. you are well fed and don't attack them) :-)
  
- Serana can make you a vampire lord at any time, without any restrictions, except she must be a vampire to do that (obviously).
  
[font=Tahoma][size=3]- **UPDATE**: Now it also prevents guards and other people from identifying you as a vampire in combat, if you are not Blood Starved.[/font]
  
  
Nothing much more to add, but bear in mind that if you get detected by Isran's test, you HAVE TO get cured by Falion. Drinking blood to become sated won't cut it.
  
  
Compatible with: Sacrosanct, Sacrilege, and vanilla vampires. I'll update this if someone confirms it. It is also automatically compatible with RDO.
  
  
Incompatible with any mod that alters the same dialogue records with Dawnguard Members, or anything about Isran's light test. And it will not work if you're using a vampire overhaul that does not rely on the vanilla spells that add frost resistance to vampires or uses them in unexpected ways, I guess, but I don't know of any that does.
