Kudos to the person that came up with the idea: fat\_mothra*

If it's a Nord tradition, dear Bethesda, why is our character the ONLY ONE following the tradition? Is no one else in Skyrim actively looking for marriage?! Is it all lies and Maramal just scammed 200 Gold out of me?I fixed these issues by making NPCs also be ~~on tinder~~ on the lookout for a husband or wife.
  
  
I thought this was an easy one, so why not.
  
  
**Features:**

  
* NPCs in the marriage faction (those you can "propose to" when you are wearing an Amulet of Mara) have a 25% chance to be equipped with an amulet of Mara themselves, thanks to SPID dark magic.
If the NPC in question is wearing an amulet and they're friendly towards you, then you can ask them out, no need to buy an Amulet yourself, following the Nord tradition.
  
* Simple and to the point. It does not edit the marriage quest, but I've added a more fitting dialogue option for these cases. Your character will say: "Is that an Amulet of Mara? Are you... interested in me?" and vanilla dialogue will follow.
**2.0 Update**: No need to go speak to Maramal to learn the Nord marriage tradition: **Nords will already know this from the start**. Other races can get a pamphlet from your local courier to get the info they need without having to travel to Riften. Just ask the courier.
  
* **2.0 Update**: Mod includes a brand new feature to cancel your engagement with NPCs. Just let them know you've changed your mind and choose someone else! In vanilla this happens unimmersively in the background :(
**2.0 Update**: If your better half dies before the wedding, the marriage system will no longer lock you out of a wedding, unlike in vanilla. You can now tell Maramal the bad news and you can find yourself another waifu or husbando. All voiced, of course.
  
* **2.0 Update**: Compatible with the newly released [Immersive Rejections](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67930)﻿.

**FAQ**

  
**- Can I customize the chance of them having an amulet?**If 25% chance is not enough, you can increase or decrease the chance of marriage candidates from having the amulet just by editing the ini file included in my mod. Changing where it says 25 to 100 will give all marriage candidates an amulet, for example.
  
  
**- ESL marked?**Yes.
  
  
**- Does this modify outfits?**No, it's done via SPID + spell that equips the amulet.
  
  
**- But I'm a male, will the dialogue show up with male marriage candidates if they are wearing an amulet and I'm not?**I better not see this question or I'll be pissed. I think we already went through this a couple of months ago. The answer is **yes, as per vanilla behaviour**. If you are SO insecure that you have a problem with this, please go away and never download any of my mods. It's a dialogue option. You choose it or you don't.
