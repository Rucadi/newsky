*Small coin purses will only have a chance of getting common gems
  
  
Medium coin purses will only**have a chance of getting**common and rare gems
  
  
Large coin purses will only have a chance of getting rare and very rare gems
  
  
  
All purses as far as I tested have only spawned 1-2 gems at once by chance, comment if you ever get more then 2 gems I'm curious how rare it is!*Side note:  I know there are mods like this but they are very old, this is a lightweight esp only mod and has a different formula shown above then other Coin Purse mods.
