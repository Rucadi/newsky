As of Version 15 [Scrambled Bugs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43532)  has a dll based solution to make staves give xp. I Haven't tested it myself, but it's probably less janky than this and I would recomend you use that instead of this mod.
  
  
This feature was present in a fow other mods. But i didn't find an standalone version anywere. It also does a few diferent things to make sure that any mod added staff will be compatible and also give XP.
  
  
This is intended for an early game source of XP and will not increase wth the power of the staff, so you can use staffs early once you run out of magicka and still get some XP for the relevant skills.
  
  
Requirements:
  
SKSE
  
  
Known issues:
  
  
-Maintained effects only give XP during initial cast. I have no way in the scripts to detect when the casting has stoped to fix this.
  
-Staffs will always give XP, without taking into account the regular vanilla conitions. So destruction will level up even if you are not dealing damage with the staff.
  
  
The permissons are completely open, do whatever you want with it. Don't need to even credit me if you don't want to.
