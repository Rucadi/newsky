> *"﻿**In Morrowind, we primarily trade drams. The Office of Exchange will exchange your septims for them. Imperial gold is scarce here and the merchants will fleece all of it from you if you let them. It's bad for you and bad for Morrowind."*
>   
> *— Galos Andrano*

  
Following the Red Year, Morrowind was devastated by the destruction wrought upon it. When they most needed aid, the Empire abandoned the Dunmer people, leaving them to fend for themselves. With limited resources and dwindling gold, a new coin of iron, the dram, was minted to usher the nation into a new era.
  
  
While drams are now the primary currency of Morrowind, many traders still prefer to deal in septims due to their higher value. Merchants often take advantage of foreigners by charging the same price in both currencies, inflating costs for those who don't know that one septim is worth three drams.

* Adds a new fully functional currency to Solstheim: the **dram**!
Vendors on Solstheim can now transact with drams in addition to septims.
  
* Distributes drams across the island in addition to the septim.
Exchange septims for drams at a new custom-voiced NPC.
  
* Adjusts prices to simulate the dram's value relative to the septim.

Thanks to [Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805)﻿ and [Container Distribution Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120152)﻿ next to no cells or containers have been edited in order to distribute drams around Solstheim.
  
  
Mods that add new vendors to Solstheim should be compatible without need of any patches. However, patching may be required if the new vendors have custom voice acting.
  
  
The currency exchanger NPC can be found in the new Office of Exchange in Raven Rock. To make room for the Office, it has taken over the former Caerellius House. Caerellius House has been relocated to the other side of town, replacing one of the ruined buildings next to Serevin Manor. **Due to these changes, if you add this mod to an existing save game, you may need to install [Save Unbaker](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85565)﻿ to ensure that everything in Raven Rock is adjusted properly.**If you're using an incompatible Raven Rock overhaul, you can use the optional plugin provided to revert these changes. In this case, the currency exchanger will be relocated inside Morvayn Manor.
  
  
This mod also includes built-in compatibility with [C.O.I.N.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51439)﻿'s auto exchange feature so that drams aren't automatically converted to septims. If used with [Skyrim Silver](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/127897)﻿, you will also be able to ask the currency exchanger about converting ulfrics to drams.
