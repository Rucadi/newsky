[font=Verdana]I have tried dozens of [Smoothcam](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41252) presets but none could deliver what I was seeking... a truely vanilla based preset that is centered on the player.
  
  
So I decided to make one myself. Watch the video below to see it in action.

- Centered on the player
  
- Instant response (I hated the trailing camera effect of the default)
  
- Truly Smooth
  
  
[/font][font=Verdana]**Hotkeys**[/font][font=Verdana]
  
- Press X to change side when aiming.
  
- Press Z to move the camera slightly upwards (useful for sneaking under some scenarios)
  
- Press V to change preset.

This preset is based on the excellent work done by SoftYT in his [SmoothCam - Soft Preset](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81228). Go and Endorse their mod as well.
  
  
And ofcourse, full credits to mwilsnd who created the original mod.
