I love Alternate Perspective. It's a great alternative of ASLAL.
  
But what's with that 10,000 gold lying in the strong box? Huh, ignore them you say?
  
Well then this patch probably isn't for you. 
  
  
But if you like me, who always choose the "wounded and barely alive" option in AP, you'll get my point. 
  
This patch remove some (most actually) gear and loot that I consider "op" or "unbalanced" in the starting room. 
  
Below is what you'll get now:
  
Spoiler
  
Iron Dagger x2,
  
Iron Sword x2,
  
 Long Bow x1 + Iron Arrows x50
  
Hide Shield x1,
  
Hide Armor Set,
  
 Beggar Clothes,
  
Spelbooks (Flame, Frostbite, Spark, Magelight, Conjure Familiar),
  
200 Gold,
  
10 Lockpicks,
  
and some cheap gems.

The file is esl flagged.
  
Put the esp under Alternate Perspective.esp, and you're good to go.
  
Enjoy.
