Sets boss type enemies incoming stagger modifier to zero. I play with multiple companions and it makes enemies like bandit chiefs and draugr overlords a bit too easy. This makes them no longer staggerable by normal attacks. Unsure how it interacts with poise as it uses their own stagger system.
  
  
Plugin contains 1 perk for stagger immunity. Although there shouldnt be any harm removing the plugin mid game you can also just delete the skypatcher folder and it will have no effect on your game.
  
  
  
Thanks to Zzyxzz for skypatcher and skyvalor, I reused his id filter to tag boss / leader.
