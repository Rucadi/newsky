This is the English translation of Vicn's new perk tree mod: [Unarmoured Defense](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52616)﻿.
  
  
There are two ways to access the perk tree.
  
  
1. Travel to the Shrine of the Unarmored One near Whiterun and commune with the **Statue of the Unarmored One**.

2. Or, if you always want to have access to the perk tree and don't mind some additional clutter in your inventory, simply buy the item called **[Perk] Unarmored Defense** from the merchant at the shrine (you can also buy some other useful items from him if you have the gold to spare).[/size]

Simply activate the statue or click on the statuette in your inventory and the skill tree will open.
