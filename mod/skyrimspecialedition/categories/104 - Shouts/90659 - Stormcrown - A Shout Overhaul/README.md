**Stormcrown - A Shout Overhaul**

  
  
Stormcrown is a complete overhaul of Skyrim’s Shout system designed to balance existing Shouts, add new Shouts and new effects for Vanilla Shouts, and provide additional progression for the player’s experience as Dragonborn.
  
  
**Requirements**
  
  
Stormcrown requires [Address Library for SKSE Plugins](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444) and the most recent version of [Custom Skills Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41780). Stormcrown requires a save in which you have not yet asked Paarthurnax to teach you to meditate on the Voice. If you've already passed that point in your game, please start a new game before installing.
  
  
**Dragonborn Perks**
  
  
When you complete your training at High Hrothgar, and the Greybeards officially recognize you as the Dragonborn, you will receive a Lesser Power called Meditate. Using the Meditate power will cause your character to enter a meditative pose, and will grant you access to a new Dragonborn perk tree. 
  
  
You acquire new perks for the Dragonborn perk tree by killing dragons and absorbing their souls. The first five perks require two souls each; the next five perks require three souls each; the next five perks require four souls each; the sixteenth and final perk requires five souls. All told, completing the Dragonborn perk tree requires that you kill fifty dragons and consume their souls. Note that these souls are not consumed by the perk tree, and you are still free to use them to unlock or upgrade Shouts.
  
  
Spoiler**Dragonborn (2/2) -**Your Shouts are 25/50% stronger.
  
  
**Dragon of the North -** You resist 25% of incoming stagger, and you take 25% less damage while staggered.
  
  
**Sky Above (2/2) -** Your Shouts last 50/100% longer
  
**Voice Within -** Your Shouts are silent to others
  
**Windcaller (2/2) -** Your Shout cooldown is reduced by 25/50%.
  
**Way of the Voice -** Once every ten minutes, when you fall below 25% Health, your Shouts have no cooldown for 10 seconds. 
  
  
**Deep Breath (2/2) -** Your Shouts have a 25/50% chance to deal double damage.
  
**Ancient Voice (2/2) -** Your Shouts have a 50/100% chance to stagger enemies.
  
**Sharp Tongue (2/2) -** Your Shouts deal 50/100% extra damage to enemies who fall below half Health. 
  
**Stormcrown -** Your Shouts have a 25% chance to have no cooldown in combat.
  
**Dragon Shouts**
  
  
Stormcrown overhauls every Shout in the game. Some Vanilla Shouts, such as Disarm and Animal Allegiance, had particularly forgettable or undesirable effects, and have been changed drastically. Stormcrown also fixes numerous bugs with existing Shouts and adds two new Shouts to the game, Lightning Breath and Poison Breath. Note that cooldown, magnitude, and duration for Shouts have been balanced with the power of the new Dragonborn perk tree in mind.

Stormcrown overhauls Paarthurnax's Meditation mechanic to provide upgrades for almost all Shouts.

Doing so will lead to Paarthurnax offering to teach you to meditate on the Words of Power. Step towards the Word Wall on which Paarthurnax is perched to begin.
  
  
Meditating on a Word of Power consumes a dragon soul, and provides a permanent upgrade to the chosen Shout. You can only meditate on the Words of Power for Shouts which you have mastered by learning and unlocking all three words. Unlike Vanilla, you can have more than one Meditation effect at a time.

**Notes**
  

  
* The words for the new Lightning Breath Shout can be fold in Yngvild's Gulf, to the east of Dushnikh Yal, and in an ashy area on southern Solstheim, respectively.
The words for the new Poison Breath Shout can be found in Bleakcoast Cave, in the Morthal Swamp, and in the Snowclad Ruins in Solstheim, respectively.
  
* Elemental Fury's Meditation requires you to have the unarmed weapon equipped to work. The unarmed weapon is an invisible weapon that the game equips on the player in certain circumstances. All major perk overhauls (Ordinator, Adamant, Vokrii, etc) apply the unarmed weapon to the character as part of their unarmed support, so we have not reduplicated that feature here.
Slow Time is not affected by perks that extend its duration, because of the way it interacts with them. This does not apply to its Meditation effect.
  
* The Subdue Shout is a reinterpretation of the Disarm Shout, and works both for the player and for enemies.

**Compatibility**
  
  
Stormcrown requires [Address Library for SKSE Plugins](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444)and the most recent version of [Custom Skills Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41780), which is only compatible with Skyrim Special Edition and Anniversary Edition 1.6.640 (Steam) and 1.6.659 (GOG). Stormcrown's edits are kept to a minimum, meaning it should not cause any major compatibility issues with your game. Stormcrown should *not* be combined with other Shout overhauls, such as Thunderchild or Forceful Tongue.
