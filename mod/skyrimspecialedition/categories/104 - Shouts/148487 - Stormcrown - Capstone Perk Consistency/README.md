In Stormcrown, the CSF perk tree has two branches.
  
  

  
* The left branch is all about duration/cooldown and control. It seems to be aligned to the Greybeard's philosophy. The capstone perk is called "Way of the Voice".
The right branch is combat-oriented with perks for damage and stagger. The capstone perk is called "Stormcrown".
  

However, the actual capstone functionality seems inverted in comparison to the rest of the branch:
  
  

  
* Way of the Voice (left) - Once every ten minutes, when you fall below 25% Health, your Shouts have no cooldown for 10 seconds.
Stormcrown (right) - Your Shouts have a 25% chance to have no cooldown in combat.
  

When playing a pacifist build, I found myself having to invest in the combat side of the tree, just to get the "25% chance" capstone perk.

In this mod, I've swapped around these two capstone perks. The names are kept the same, as they already felt thematic to the branch. Only the underlying effects are swapped.
  
  
Changed Perks:
  
  

  
* Way of the Voice (left) - Your Shouts have a 25% chance to have no cooldown ~~in combat~~.
Stormcrown (right) -  Once every ten minutes, when you fall below 25% Health, your Shouts have no cooldown for 10 seconds.
  

I've also removed the "in combat" condition to make it more pacifist, and also because I felt it didn't add much in actual gameplay.
