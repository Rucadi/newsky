The dragon aspect overhaul mod you didn't know you wanted but that you definitely need. Since Dragon Aspect in vanilla is pretty awful, especially for mages, I decided that a little overhaul was necessary, so Dragon Aspect Overhaul was made.
  
  
**Features**
  
- Removed the sound that plays when Dragon Aspect is active.
  
- Removed the chance to summon an Ancient Dragonborn.
  
- A tail grows on your character when the 3rd word is used.
  
- An overall buff to the shout. Also, if [SPID](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869)﻿ is installed, Miraak will benefit from *all* the changes.
  
  
Dragon Aspect Overhaul comes in two version: Vanilla & Shout.
  
Vanilla version has a cooldown of **5**\**5**\**5** seconds and can be used once a day, with a duration of **10** minutes.
  
Shout version has a cooldown of **60**\**120**\**360** seconds and can be used as much as you like, with a duration of **5** minutes.
  
  
**Dragon Aspect**
  
For **300**\**600** seconds, Power attacks are **25**\**50**\**75**% stronger and physical attacks deal **20**\**35**\**50**% more damage. Alteration, Conjuration and Illusion spells last **20**\**35**\**50**% longer, Destruction spells deal **20**\**35**\**50**% more damage and Restoration ones cost **20**\**35**\**50**% less. Health, Magicka and Stamina Regeneration improve by **25**\**50**\**100**%. Incoming physical damage is reduced by **25**\**50**% and Magic Resistance increases by **20**\**35**%. Shout cooldown is decreased by **25**%.
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
Dragon Aspect Overhaul is not compatible with mods which purpose is the same. Any Shouts Overhaul is compatible, as far DAO overwrites them. A patch for Unique Dragon Aspect is provided in the installer.
