**Is this mod for you?**   
   
Have you ever tried to equip armor on your follower only to find that they're being snotty little brats and not removing their default armor they think is better than what you're giving them?  Then you go into their inventory and can't see the armor they refuse to remove?  Then you curse Talos because Lydia won't wear your slooty armor?
  
   
If yes, bazinga!  Keep reading, and get a nice little glimpse into my life, where I yell at women and clothes vanish from their bodies (works on men too when I'm feeling saucy!).
  
   
If no, just download it, endorse it, delete it... because I desperately need validation.  Or track it and save it for later.   At some point, you may need it. 
  
   
   
**Description**   
   
It's quite simple, so I won't belabor this page with unnecessary length and explanations.
  
   
There's a "Mysterious Drink" (looks like a Skooma bottle) on the corner of the bar/counter at the Bannered Mare in Whiterun (see the first image above).  Someone probably left it there, and the golden rule anyone will tell you at a bar is if you find a drink, finder's keepers, so obviously you drink it.  Guzzle that puppy on down and learn the "Disarmor Ally" shout this plugin adds to the game.  Is the method of learning this shout immersive, you might ask?  Well, without questioning it, you drink what I can only imagine to be thousand year old potions deep within ancient Nordic dungeons that could quite literally be Draugr urine from some long-dead jack@ss who thought it would be funny, so...  yes? 
  
   
This mod will work on all followers, vanilla and custom.  For Serana's hood, see [this](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/577/?).
  
   
   
**How it Works**   
   
**1)** You use the new "Disarmor Ally" shout at your follower (aim and fire baby)
  
   
**2)** A script removes *all items* from the follower's inventory and temporarily gives those items to a vanilla NPC in the game
  
   
**3)** A script then runs on that vanilla NPC to evaluate the new items in his inventory
  
**a)** If the item is an armor piece, it goes to your inventory
  
**b)** If the item is not an armor piece, it goes back to your follower's inventory
  
**c)** The vanilla NPC's inventory is emptied of these new items, like nothing ever happened
  
   
**4)** Your follower's default outfit is changed to one without any clothing pieces assigned (i.e. nekid!) 
  
   
   
**Optional Files**   
   

  
* **Reclothe Ally** - See "How it Works" above... same methodology, different effect (one more "mysterious drink" on the bar at the Bannered Mare).  Once you've used the "Disarmor Ally" shout on your follower, you can use this one to reset their default outfit.  Vanilla followers are reset to the outfit they were in when you first saw them.  Custom followers will be equipped with a wench's outfit and boots.  Should avoid naked followers walking around after you dismiss them and send them home.

  
   
**Concluding Remarks and Warnings**   
   
And that's it.  Get someone to follow you and shout at them.  When they're nekid, equip them with whatever armor you want, without having to worry about their default armor having a higher rating than what you're giving them, or defaulting back to their default armor after you console RemoveAllItems.  No reload time on the shout, and it'll only work on followers.  Why only followers?  Because I don't want you to complain that I broke your game because you were being a goofy little @#$\*& running around shouting at everyone and giggling like a schoolgirl, and now everyone is naked and you can't change them back.  Speaking of which...
  
   
WARNING: This will change the default outfit for your follower, and you can't undo that, no matter how many times you console disable/enable or kill/resurrect.  That said, you get the armor they were wearing added to your inventory (yes, even custom followers), so you can always give it back if you want them to reequip it.  You would need the optional "Reclothe Ally" shout in the downloads section to reset vanilla follower outfits.  You should be able to uninstall custom follow mod/load game/save game/reinstall custom follower mod to reset a custom follower's default outfit (unconfirmed).
  
   
I think that about covers it.  Backup your game save just in case, and let me know if you see any funny business.  I check this page frequently, so happy to help.  Most of the page views are probably me seeing if I have any endorsements.  \*sigh\*
  
   
   
**Installation/Uninstallation**   
   
To install, use NMM or manually add the plugin (.esp) to you "Data" directory, and the included scripts to the "Data\scripts" directory
  
   
To uninstall, use NMM or do the opposite of installing manually
  
   
   
**Change Log**   
**v1.1**   

  
* Added the Reclothe Ally shout (optional file)
Changed the item steward (step 2 in How It Works) from the Dark Brotherhood Initiate, since that NPC is in fact eligible to be a follower
  
* Changed the Disarmor Ally outfit to nude (no more footwraps)
