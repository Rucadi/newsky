**Dragonborn - Shouts Perk Tree**

  
Dragonborn is a completely standalone perk tree focused on shouts. You can access to the perk tree using the Ysmir Meditation power, added after the completion of The Way of the Voice.
  
  
Dragonborn is designed to work alongside [Forceful Tongue](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36276), but doesn’t require it.
