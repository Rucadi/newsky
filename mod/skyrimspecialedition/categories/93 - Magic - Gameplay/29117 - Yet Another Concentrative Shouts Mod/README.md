# Yet Another Concentrative Shouts Mod

Such mods already exist, so why make another?
  
  
While I liked the idea, I was never quite happy with how the functionality worked in other mods. I had three major gripes:
  
  

  
1. More than just the shout effects were touched.
Incompatibility with the vanilla "Fire Within" effect.
  
2. Incompatibility with the Dragonborn DLC black book rewards.

  
So I set out to implement this game-play change with the above points in mind. This makes the following changes to the shouts:
  
  
Second Word
  
Sends out a ball projectile of fire/frost that reaches vast distances and explodes on impact. Actors within range of the explosion all get damaged.
  
  
Third Word
  
Send out a spout of fire/frost like a true dovah! Causes damage in a concentrated cone.
  
  
Things to note
  
  

  
1. Don't use the second or third word on Paarthurnax. This will make him aggressive. The first word effect is untouched, and can be safely used to progress the quest.
Other actors get the modified shout too. So beware Draugr with this shouts, for they can annihilate you. Or get buffed up on resist fire/frost! I didn't want to touch their shouts to avoid a compatibility nightmare.
  
2. This is just and ESP flagged as an ESL, so it won't take a load order slot!

* [Dragonborn Ascendant SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25793)﻿ - Balances other shouts really nicely IMO. Also gives Draugr their own fire/frost. It touches on player's fire/frost shouts as well, so load my mod second to get the concentrative effects.
[Rotmulaag - Immersive Meditations on the Words of Power](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3854)﻿ - Role-play as a disciple of Paarthurnax and mediate on many more words of power. Thus unlocking many more great effects! Checked that Rotmulaag's "Fo" passive power affects the modified shouts.
