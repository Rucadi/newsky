Kittytail's wonderful Spell Mods have attributes that are not FIRE, SHOCK, or FROST, so the power cannot be increased with normal PERKs and there were times when the power felt insufficient in the latter half of the game.
  
So I used the features of "[Ascension 2](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92000)" to successfully increase the power.
  
This is achieved using "[Keyword Item Distributor (KID)](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55728)" so there are no conflicts and it is safe.
