-NPCs React To Invisibility-

  
Similar to [NPCs React To Necromancy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70428), I bring you yet another fun mod to bring more life into your Skyrim. Enjoy having more dynamic NPCs that react to situations happening in their surroundings, this time featuring invisibility! This idea came from the community, so kudos to whoever came up with it, I love it and it's a lot of fun seeing the NPCs react realistically to this :)
  
  
Features:
  
  
- Around 400 new voiced reactions, spliced from vanilla lines. 
  
- Only NPCs that make sense will react (Mages or those familiar with illusion won't be surprised)
  
- Mod does not edit a single vanilla record, so... compatible with everything. Yes, this includes other invisibility mods.
  
- As of V1.10: Mod now includes reactions to being ethereal.
  
- ESL and safe to install mid-game.

**- ESL flagged? Safe to install mid-game?**Yes. Oui. Ja. Sí. Aye. Sim. Evet. Na-am. Hai. Tak. Da. Igen. Or in vanilla speech: "Of course. How can I argue with that?"
  
  
**- Will NPCs react if I drink an invisibility potion?**Yes, they will. Anything that turns you invisible will make nearby NPCs react in different ways.
  
  
**- Will mages familiar with invisibility react?**Most mages won't react, as they've seen or heard about the spell before. Drevis himself might congratulate you if you cast the spell near him. Some mages might get spooked, but they shouldn't say things like "DAMN MAGES!" or similar lol.
  
  
**- This is a rather niche mod. I'm barely ever invisible!**That might be so! The mod however is super light and is basically "sleeping" the entire time unless you're currently invisible, so there's no reason not to have it in. Maybe one day you find an invisibility potion in your travels and decide to give it a try. With 300 different reactions, there's plenty of funny situations to discover and there's nothing more immersion breaking than NPCs not reacting to things happening in their surroundings!
  
  
**- Jay, when are you making companions quest expanison?!!!!!' Stop releasing other shit and do what I want!!!**[\*Disappears\*](https://media.tenor.com/a5w95V3HdVcAAAAM/nileseyy-niles-peace-out.gif)﻿ ﻿Ehhh... I'm super busy with IRL stuff atm unfortunately... No plans for big quest expansions right now :(
  
  
**- Where do you get the inspiration for your mods?***...[skooma](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80975), the imported stuff, just one last time...*For real: the invisibility idea came from one of you. I can't find the person anymore but thank you for the suggestion, I love it and it came out great!
  
  
**- Is "NPCs React To X" a mod series you're going to expand in the future?**Maybe! Do you want more of these? If you have some cool mod ideas, I might make them come true. Fairy Godmother style.
