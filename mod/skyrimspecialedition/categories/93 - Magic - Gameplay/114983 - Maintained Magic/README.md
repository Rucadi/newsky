# Maintained Magic

This is a spell upkeep mod. There are many like it (or not), but this one is mine. It does not modify spells in any way, does not require patches, configuration, or any kind of effort by the user. For the lazy mage.
  
  
If you are not familiar with the concept, it basically just lets you keep your buffs forever instead of having to recast things in/before combat. The price for this convenience is a reduced max Magicka pool.
  
  
**How to use**:
  
You get a power. Use it. Cast spell(s). Enjoy.
  
Perks that affect duration and cost of spells will also affect upkeep cost.
  
Maintained spells have their cost reduced to zero while they are actively maintained to allow the player to re-cast them to break maintenance and drop the upkeep.
  
Alternatively, the power can also be used to dispel everything if used with no spells in both hands.

**Limitations and other notes:**
  
Works with pretty much anything that targets yourself. Also works with conjured minions. Does **not** work with reanimation spells ~~and conjured weapons~~.
  
Upkeep cost depends on the duration and the cost of the spell (this includes cost reductions from enchantments and perks).
  
Technically any spell with a base duration above 5 seconds can be maintained, but the cost skyrockets with short spells.
  
Some spells make no sense to maintain, especially mod-added ones with complex scripted effects.
  
  
By default, most spell visuals will be suppressed (can be changed inside MaintainedMagicNG.Config.ini) to keep your character nice and clean-looking.
  
  
**Regarding bound weapons:**After conjuring a weapon with the power active, you will receive a "Maintained [Bound Weapon]" spell in that hand. It can be used to instantly summon that weapon.
  
That weapon can be sheathed and re-summoned for free, and will last indefinitely like all other maintained spells while it is out.
  
Removing either the spell or the weapon from that hand will break the effect.
  
  
**Before uninstalling or updating, dispel all maintained magic.**
  
**Compatibility:**Everything.
  
  
**ESL-ified:**
  
Yes.
  
  
**Experience:**Yes. Roughly one spell cast of XP every five minutes.
  
  
**Configuration:**
  
The first time you launch the game with this mod enabled, it will create a configuration file in /SKSE/Plugins/MaintainedMagicNG.Config.ini
  
The default values will be fine for almost all use-cases.
