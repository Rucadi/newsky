Staff Enhanced Magicka:
  
  
Gives you extra Magicka when wielding a staff, so that pure mages have a reason to equip them.
  
  
The Magicka bonus starts at +50 and scales up to +150 at character level 40
  
  
Mod is esl flagged
  
  
Should work with mod added staves but only if they have the right keywords
  
  
Does not conflict with any staff/magic/perk overhaul. It uses its own hidden perk and can be used alongside any of them.
