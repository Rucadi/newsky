[/color]It adds the ability to FLY for player and NPC Followers. The mod adds 3 minor powers.
  
The Fly power
  
The Fly Power for NPC
  
and Configuration of the Fly power
  
  
HOW TO GET THE POWERS?
  
Those abillities come in form of  spell/powers, you can easily buy them from Magic vendors. Tolfdir, for example. The price is moderate, so it wont be a problem for even the most money saving Dovahkiin.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Install the mod with NMM.
  
YOU HAVE TO DOWNLOAD FNIS AND SKSE IN ORDER TO RUN THIS MOD AND NOT BREAK YOUR GAME! THE SKSE INSTALLATION TUTORIAL COULD BE FOUND EASILY AS WELL AS FNIS. i HAVE PROVIDED LINKS BOTH FOR FNIS AND SKSE BELOW IN THE REQUIREMENTS SECTION. BELOW, I BRIEFLY TRIED TO COVER THE MAIN STEPS OF WHAT HAS TO BE DONE IN FNIS FOR THE PROPER INSTALLATION OF THIS WORK. PLEASE READ CAREFULLY!
  
  
  
"" OPEN FNIS FOR USERS AND CLICK UPDATE, YOU MIGHT REQUIRE AN ""ARM FIX FOR CUSTOM SKELETONS"" (ALREADY INCLUDED IN THE FNIS FOR USERS). AFTER FNIS WILL FINISH UPDATING THE ANIMATION FILES,JUST CLOSE THE WINDOW. IN CASE A FIX IS NEEDED, FIND ON THE SPECIFIED BY FNIS PROGRAM FIX IN THE BAR BELOW, CHOOSE IT AND CLICK UPDATE AGAIN. AFTER IT IS DONE, CHECK THAT THERE ARE NO ERROR NOTIFICATIONS/MESSAGES. IF SUCCESSFUL CLOSE THE PROGRAM, IF NOT LOOK FOR THE ERROR MESSAGE IN THE STATUS BAR.AFTER YOU FINISH THIS - RUN THE GAME USING THE SKSE PLUGIN! IT IS CRUCIAL!!!""
  
  
Everything was converted for Skyrim Special Edition and need no further adjustments.
  
  
COMPATIBLE with
  
Animated Dragon Wings By Anton SE
  
Animated Feathered Wings SE
  
  
**Updates:**
  
Version 2.0 - I converted it to Form 44 and fixed several small bugs.
  
Merged the flying mod with the overhaul, because many people skipped it, while it fixed 98% of the mod. Now you have only to download the main file, it includes the mod and the overhaul with the fixes.
