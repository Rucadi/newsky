**Sorcerer Patch Page**

  
The Sorcerer Patch Page is a library of patches for [Sorcerer - A Staff and Scroll Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/95196), including a Synthesis-based patcher that will generate automatic compatibility patches between Sorcerer and other spell mods.
  
  
**Sorcerer Synthesis Patcher**
  
The most important file hosted on this page is a Synthesis patcher created by [ThirdEyeSqueegee](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/159660683). Using this patcher, you can automatically generate a Sorcerer patch for every mod in your load order that adds scrolls or staves. The instructions to use the patcher are as follows:
  
  

* Install [Synthesis](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Synthesis/releases) and add it as an executable to your mod manager of choice.
Download and extract the Sorcerer Synthesis patcher.
  
* Launch Synthesis through your mod manager. While Synthesis is open in the background, double-click the extracted SorcererPatcher.synth.
Select the newly-added patcher in Synthesis, select "Latest" for both patcher version settings, and click Run (we recommend deselecting any other patchers you might have added to Synthesis).
  
* Load the generated patch as late as possible in your load order, preferably last.

  
For more information on installing and using Synthesis, you can [visit their GitHub](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Synthesis/wiki/Installation). The following is a brief overview of the patcher's functionality:
  
  

* Generates recipes, breakdown recipes, and research notes for each scroll.
Generates recipes for each staff.
  
* Rectifies the value of each scroll to match the values in Mysticism, and distributes necessary keywords.
Rectifies the enchantment charge, cost, and amount of each staff to match the values in Mysticism, and distributes necessary keywords.
  

  
Note that the Sorcerer Synthesis patcher only makes changes to [winning records](https://tes5edit.github.io/docs/5-conflict-detection-and-resolution.html#DifferencesbetweenConflictsandOverrides) in your load order, thereby preserving all edits/additions made by mods in your load order.
  
  
**Sorcerer - Winterhold Patches**﻿
  
  
Sorcerer adds its new tables to three locations in Winterhold--the College Arcanaeum, the Arch-Mage's Quarters, and the Frozen Hearth. [Janquel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/51448566?tab=user+files) has provided us with a number of patches for mods such as [Obscure's College of Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20514), [Immersive College of Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17004), and [Cities of the North - Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40088).
  
  
**Sorcerer - Pre-generated Patches**
  
  
Several pre-generated patches are provided in the Miscellaneous Files section. The pre-generated patches are for [Darenii's](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5073294?tab=user+files) spell packs, [EnaiSiaion's](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3959191?tab=user+files) Apocalypse, Odin, and Triumvirate, and [Oreo's](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/56683512?tab=user+files) CC Staves - Mysticism Consistency Patch. Note that the Synthesis patcher will automatically patch these mods if present in your load order. These pre-generated patches are provided for convenience, and to support users who might be intimidated by running an automated patcher.
