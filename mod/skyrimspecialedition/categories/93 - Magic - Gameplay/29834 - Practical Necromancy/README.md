[font=Times New Roman]::FEATURES::[/font]
  
  
I've always been that guy who plays mage characters in RPGs. Necromancers have always been my favorite class to play for the added difficulty and strategy involved with optimizing undead, the preparation required beforehand and the sheer satisfaction when you were repaid for all of the time and effort that went into them. I will never forget all of the fun that I've had with reanimation in Oblivion and Skyrim, but I've always wanted some more complexity in the Necromancy experience and variety in the necromancer builds that can be possible, so I created this mod to hopefully help with that.
  
  
  
  
This mod DOES a few things:
  
  

  
* It creates its own Necromancy skill which is separate from the Conjuration skill, levels up the more its practiced and influences a few of the new spells and perks.
It introduces a few new mechanics to the Necromancy experience while keeping as close to the lore as possible.
  
* It gives you an immersive way to gradually improve and expand their Necromancy knowledge via a unique grimoire.
It prevents reanimated thralls from turning to ash when they die, which allows them to be reanimated again. Please note that enemy Necromancers will also benefit from this feature as well so it will make fighting them more challenging.
  
* It provides the means to toggle off the default zombie voices for reanimated thralls.
It adds a few new reanimation spells that eliminate the level cap and opens up the ability to reanimate a larger range of different corpses than before.
  
* it grants you the opportunity to customize the weapons, armor and default outfits of reanimated thralls.
It gives you the ability to summon reanimated thralls.
  
* It offers you the ability to increase the reanimation limit in an immersive manner.
Reanimated thralls raised with the new reanimation spells will not trigger the annoying "That spell looks dangerous" comment from NPCs.
  
* It grants you the ability to dissect corpses and harvest organs and ingredients that are typically difficult to find in the vanilla game.
It gives you a way to view stats for reanimated thralls so that you can easily compare them and be well informed when trying to optimize them.
  
* It adds an alternate means outside of the [permanent corpse exploit](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/xbox360/615803-the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/faqs/64585/grave-robbing-and-permanent-corpse-exploit) to safely and permanently keep corpses.
It grants you the ability to create a wide variety of undead that can be reanimated.
  
* It adds the ability to memorize a large number of humanoids and creatures to create clones.
It includes fixes for a few of the vanilla necromancy bugs, namely the "moonwalking" bug.
  
* It opens up more uses for Black Soul Gems beyond enchantments.
It introduces a new recipe for the Atronach Forge that unlocks the ability to craft Black Soul Gems as well as other immersive ways to acquire them.
  
* It offers an immersive way to resurrect dead NPCs without the need of console commands.
It gives you the ability to craft unenchanted replicas of a few Necromancer gear like the Necromancer's Amulet and the Necromancer's Robes set.
  
* It grants you the ability to craft embalming tools which can be used to perform dissections.
It gives you the ability to craft unenchanted "cloth" versions of the daedric gauntlets for the folks out there like me who only plays in first person and loves the look of those gauntlets when casting spells but don't want to forfeit the armor bonus from the Mage Armor perk. #FashionScrolls
  

  
  
This mod DOES NOT:
  
  

  
* Require SKSE 64.
Come with an MCM menu.
  
* Require a new game or save.
Edit any of the vanilla perks or perk trees.
  
* Edit any of the vanilla spells.
Add any custom alchemical ingredients.
  
* Add a lot of custom miscellaneous items.
Criminalize Necromancy; you won't gain a bounty for practicing it.
  
* Localize Necromancy; you can perform it from anywhere without being bound to specific locations.

  
  
  
  
  
[font=Times New Roman]::DE VERMIS MYSTERIIS::[/font]
  
  
De Vermis Mysteriis, also known as "Mysteries of the Worm," is a dark grimoire which serves as teacher and mentor to new necromancers. The grimoire has a life of its own and is said to appear to new necromancers after they reanimate a corpse. It tempts Necromancers with the promise of power at the cost of souls. It can be summoned with the "Summon Grimoire" power, alternatively a tangible version can be crafted at a tanning rack. The tangible grimoire occupies the shield slot when equipped, can be favorited and can be held by you. Despite being flagged as a shield, it does not provide any armor and will not conflict with the Mage Armor perk from Alteration. Once read, you can begin your journey to become a powerful Necromancer.
  
  
  
Spoiler

  
* Update Mod - This option only becomes visible whenever a new update of this mod is installed, you will need to press this option to finalize the updating process in-game.
Read Grimoire - This option leads the you deeper into the book and teaches the new perks and spells that the mod has to offer.
  
* Open Perk Tree - This option opens up the perk tree provided that you have both [Custom Skills Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41780) and its patch in the Practical Necromancy's download section installed.

* Ritual - Lets you to perform the "Soul Harvest" and "Requiem" rituals.
Soul Harvest - A ritual that lets you to convert filled black soul gems into the "Souls" currency that's used by the mod. It will also allow you to fill black soul gems with "Souls" gathered from the Soul Harvest spell.
  
* Requiem - This ritual allows players to recover or discard the templates of broken minions that were automatically disposed by the mod. The templates are used as a reference in the creation of Corrupted Thralls. Please keep in mind that this ritual only appears after the mod has disposed your first broken minion.
Stats - The player's necromancy related stats can be viewed with this option.
  
* Storage - This option only becomes available if either Cheat Mode or Debug Mode is enabled.
Cheat Chest - This option only becomes available if Cheat Mode is enabled in the mod's settings, it's a magical chest that can be accessed via the book and contains several starting ingredients and tools required for Necromancy. It has also been flagged as safe storage, perfect for all of the cheating criminal scum out there.
  
* Access Storage - This a safe storage chest available to you if you actually need it.
Junk Chest - This option only becomes available if the Debugging Mode is enabled in the mod's settings, it is a chest which temporarily stores the belongings of the last 25 corpses that were disposed, thus giving the player another opportunity to access those items should they accidentally dispose a corpse with loot that they wanted or to recover items from broken minions that was automatically disposed by the mod.
  
* Settings - This allows players to tweak specific aspects of the mod.
Difficulty Mode: Casual - This mode circumvents the requirements for "Souls" for casting certain spells via the mod's menu interactions. It also makes black soul gems immune to breaking from the "Soul Harvest" ritual. Casual Mode will increase the chance to obtain Necromancy items with the "Augury of Death" perk by 11%
  
* Difficulty Mode: Normal - This difficulty mode will impose the price of "Souls" for certain spells however it will likewise make black soul gems immune to breaking from the "Soul Harvest" ritual. This mode will increase the chance of obtaining occult items with the "Augury of Death" perk by 9%.
Difficulty Mode: Hard - This mode imposes a requirement of "Souls" to cast spells at zero magicka cost via menu interactions. Inexperienced Necromancers who perform the "Soul Harvest" ritual will run the risk of breaking their filled black soul gems into soul gem fragments. This chance of breaking black soul gems reduces with increased Necromancy skill, however, black soul gems will no longer shatter once the player achieves a Necromancy skill level of 100+. Features two new recipes in the Soul Harvest ritual which will allow players to combine those soul gem fragments and either a greater or grand soul gem for a black soul gem. This mode will apply a 1 Soul penalty for every cast of the Memento Mori spell and will increase the chance of obtaining Necromancy items with the "Augury of Death" perk by 7%.
  
* Difficulty Mode: Nightmare - This difficulty mode comes with all the same penalties and features as Hard Mode but will instead increase the chance of obtaining Necromancy items with the "Augury of Death" perk by 5%.
Debugging Mode - This setting unlocks the "Debug" button for each unique menu interaction (for the grimoire, corpses and undead). Debugging will attempt to fix any bug that the player might encounter. This mode also unlocks the "Junk Chest," a chest which temporarily stores the items of the last few corpses that were disposed.
  
* Cheat Mode - This setting sets the mod to ignore the requirements of souls and ingredients to perform Necromancy. It also introduces two new "scrolls" that expand the number of clones that can be studied, or souls bound to the grimoire - each of those new unique "scrolls" can store data on 128 unique corpses. It also grants players access to a "Cheat Chest" via the grimoire which can be accessed from anywhere in the world and contains items that can be used to test the mod. Cheat Mode makes black soul gems immune to breaking from the "Soul Harvest" ritual. It increases the chance of obtaining Necromancy items with the "Augury of Death" perk by 100% and overrides the loot chance for the different difficulty modes. It allows players to craft undead and unlock chapters in the grimoire for free. It enables the ability to "feed" Souls to the Grimoire via the Soul Harvest ritual in exchange for Insight: for Normal difficulty exchange 5 Souls to earn 1 Insight (1 Soul per Insight for Casual, 7 Souls per Insight for Hard and 10 Souls per Insight for Nightmare).
Speedrun Mode - This setting will allow players to speed up the dissection process by skipping the fade to black sequence. It also allows players to bypass menu prompts that request for confirmation before performing irreversible actions like dissections, disposals, etc.
  
* Zombie Voice - This setting toggles the default zombie voice or undead moans of humanoid reanimated thralls on or off. Please note that once the zombie voices are toggled off the reanimated thralls will use the idle and combat voices lines that they had in life.
Undead Breathing - This setting toggles off the breathing sounds from the following custom undead available with the Create Undead ritual: Frozen Falmer, Spectral Draugr, all of the Draugr and Skeleton variants. Please note that once enabled the fix will only take hold once the undead goes through a loading screen or is debugged. Once again this option only works with undead native to the Create Undead ritual and will not work with undead outside of the ritual.
  
* Idle Animations - This setting disables the book reading animations for the Summon Grimoire power.
Reanimation Shader Fix - This setting enables a fix that allows reanimation shaders to persist on Promoted Undead as they go through loading screens.
  
* Auto Promote - This option is enabled by default and automatically promotes reanimated thralls upon reanimation. Toggle this off if you would like to handle this manually.
Compatibility Mode (Corpse Menu) - This setting improves compatibility with undetected mods with corpse menus that conflict with the Corpse Preparation perk.
  
* Compatibility Mode (Undead Menu) - This setting improves compatibility with undetected mods with menus that allow interaction with reanimated thralls which conflict with the Speak With Dead perk.
Debug Mod - This option allows players to debug the mod itself and only becomes available when Debugging Mode is enabled. It's recommended that you at least attempt to debug the mod first before filing any bug reports should the issue persists.
  
* Close - This option closes the book's menu.

::NECROMANCY SKILL SYSTEM::
  
  
This mod isolates Necromancy into its own skill which can be leveled up. It can be leveled up by soul trapping, performing rituals, creating the undead, reanimating the dead, fighting enemies with your minions (Undead Summons, Promoted Undead and Dominated Thralls), summoning the undead, destroying unbound undead, dissecting corpses, harvesting ingredients, studying corpses and binding souls. It is uncapped, meaning that it's possible to push your Necromancy skill beyond level 100 and the mod is designed in such a way that players will still benefit from pushing Necromancy past 100. You will learn a new power, "Summon Grimoire" that will let you access the grimoire soon after you reanimate your very first corpse with the mod enabled.
  
  
  
::SOULS SYSTEM::
  
  
Souls are needed as a power source for certain rituals (like reanimations with zero magicka cost via menu interactions) and, as the beginning of this section hinted to, a currency to unlock more chapters to advance one's knowledge in Necromancy. In a way, "Souls" will behave like a currency for the purposes of this mod. To obtain "Souls" the player needs to acquire a black soul gem that's filled with a grand soul and perform the "Soul Harvest" ritual with the book. Alternatively, players can use the Soul Harvest spell to harvest these "Souls" directly. Players can also do the reverse and channel their "Souls" into empty black soul gems in order to fill them.
  
  
  
::INSIGHT SYSTEM::
  
  
Insight is a fragment of necromantic knowledge that is required to make sense of the new perks and unlock them. You will automatically gain an Insight point every 5 Necromancy levels. In addition to this you can obtain Insight via new unique books that will be found off the corpses of practitioners of the Dark Arts called, Manuscripts. There are six different Manuscripts in total, which are dropped by Necromancers, Witches, Hagravens, Dragon Priests and more. Each Manuscript will test your skill at Necromancy based on the parameters highlighted in the Necromancy Skill System section above: reanimating corpses, creating undead, dissecting corpses, harvesting souls, etc. Manuscripts will enhance your roleplay experience by enabling your ability to learn from your enemies, will add more incentives for you to explore Skyrim and add more value to clearing out Necromancer dungeons beyond just getting more expensive loot. The following is a breakdown of all the different Manuscripts and where you can find them:
  
  
  
Spoiler

  
* Necromantic Manuscript: Reanimation - This has a chance to be found off the corpses of practitioners of the Dark Arts (like Necromancers) and will test the player's experience in reanimating the dead.
Necromantic Manuscript: Dragon Cult Prayerbook - This has a chance to be found off the corpses of Dragons and will test the player's experience in creating undead.
  
* Necromantic Manuscript: Liturgical Studies - This has a chance to be found off the corpses of Dawnguard, Vigilants of Stendarr and magically inclined Bandits. It will test the player's competence at destroying undead. Why destroying undead? Think of it in the same way that one would dismantle a radio in order to understand how it works - that's the logic behind this.
Necromantic Manuscript: Anatomy - This has a chance to be found off the corpses of magically inclined Draugr and Dragon Priests and will test the player's experience in dissecting corpses.
  
* Necromantic Manuscript: Ritual Studies - This has a chance to be found off the corpses of magically inclined Forsworn (Shamans), Witches, Hags and Hagravens and will test the player's experience in performing rituals.
Necromantic Manuscript: Runology - This has a chance to be found off the corpses of Vampires and will test the player's experience in harvesting souls.
  

Now, the test is a very simple formula: it is numerically the same as the player's Necromancy level. For example, if you have your Necromancy skill at level 20 and you find a Necromantic Manuscript: Anatomy, then you will need to have done at least 20 dissections in order to obtain the Insight from that manuscript. It is a very simple formula so you can instantly figure out what is required of you without getting bogged down by math.
  
  
  
::CHAPTERS SYSTEM::
  
  
With the "Read Grimoire" option of the grimoire, new spells and perks can be learned, however, the grimoire does not share its knowledge freely: you will need to offer it "Souls" or have gained enough "Insight" while having ink and paper at hand to transcribe its wisdom into chapters. The grimoire will slowly reveal more chapters that can be unlocked with higher Necromancy levels (every 25 levels). If you wish to unlearn a specific perk or spell, then simply reopen the chapter to forget the chapter's contents. Once a player has learned the contents of a chapter it will "disappear" from the book, but if you wish to craft more copies of that chapter then toggling on Debug Mode will make that chapter's recipe visible again.

::PERK TREE SYSTEM::
  
  
Through the use of [Custom Skill Framework (CSF)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41780) and its patch within this mod's download section, players can access Practical Necromancy's perks via a perk tree instead of the chapters system. Equip the Grimoire and click the "Open Perk Tree" button to see the tree or use either [Custom Skills Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62423) or [Denji's Custom Skills Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/130095). The way in which perks on the Necromancy perk tree are unlocked depends on the CSF Patch that was downloaded and enabled: the Insight CSF Patch consumes insight, the Perk Point CSF Patch consumes perk points (the same pool of perk points that you gain whenever your character levels up) while the Soul CSF Patch consumes souls that were harvested. Please note that while this mod's perks can be learned from the tree, its spells will only be accessible via the Grimoire.

::NECROTIC AFFINITY SYSTEM::
  
  
Necromancy involves the manipulation of souls, and the grimoire equips the budding necromancer with the means to bend souls to their will. Players can choose one of seven different affinities: Soul, Fire, Frost, Shock, Poison, Disease and Blood through the "Necrotic Affinity" spell and during specific conditions. With an affinity the player communes with souls of those who died in a specific and tragic manner connected to that affinity and then attunes the player to it. Fire Affinity binds the player to the souls of those who met their end to thirst or fire and can be unlocked while the player is being attacked with fire spells, being burnt by fire outside of combat or whenever the weather is hot. Frost affinity aligns the player with the souls of those who died from the harsh cold of Skyrim and can be chosen whenever the player is struck with ice spells or while wandering through snowy weather. With Shock Affiinity the player binds themselves to the pain of those who perished to lightning, it can be triggered whenever the weather is rainy or stormy or while being killed with shock magic. A player can commune with the souls of those who died from poisoning while under the effects of poison themselves to unlock Poison Affinity. Disease Affinity can be unlocked after the player has contracted a disease or while battling creatures known to spread them like rats and wolves. Blood Affinity links the player to those who were brutally murdered and can be unlocked by getting your health dangerously low, while battling vampires or by contracting Sanguinare Vampiris. Soul Affinity ties the player to the restless souls of those who died under mysterious circumstances and gets selected whenever the player casts the spell in ominous weather like fog or whenever the weather is overcast. Necrotic Affinity allows players to customize the visuals of the reanimated thralls that were raised by the new reanimation spells in this mod, it alters the damage types for certain hostile spells and interacts in different ways with some of the new perks like Necrotic Inoculation and Necrotic Bloom.

::CORRUPTION SYSTEM::
  
  
The mod allows players to create permanent undead, that will exist without time limits and can be given commands, called Awakened Undead. These Awakened Undead can be ordered to wait and follow and can be commanded to guard and patrol the player's home or lair. More importantly, Awakened Undead also ignores the player's summon limit, with this in mind, the Corruption mechanic steps in to maintain balance. Corruption acts like a disease and steadily climbs with more Awakened Undead brought into the world and will apply increasingly harmful debuffs to the player. For those familiar with Enderal it is similar to its Arcane Fever mechanic and like Enderal this mod offers perks and solutions to manage and combat Corruption. If you would like a preview on the debuffs imposed for the different thresholds of Corruption then click the spoiler below:
  
  
Spoiler

  
* Acute Corruption (0-24% Corruption): Incoming hostile spells deal X% more damage.
Minor Corruption (25-49% Corruption): Health Regeneration has been reduced by 25%. Incoming hostile spells deal X% more damage.
  
* Moderate Corruption (50-74% Corruption): Health Regeneration has been reduced by 50%. Magicka Regeneration has been reduced by 25%. Incoming hostile spells deal X% more damage.
Major Corruption (75-99% Corruption): Health Regeneration has been reduced by 75%. Magicka Regeneration has been reduced by 50%. Incoming hostile spells deal X% more damage.
  
* Severe Corruption (100-124% Corruption): My Health Regeneration is Stunted. Magicka Regeneration has been reduced by 75%. Incoming hostile spells deal X% more damage.
Chronic Corruption (125%+ Corruption): My Health and Magicka Regeneration are Stunted. Incoming hostile spells deal X% more damage.
  

Where X is 25% of the player's Corruption for Normal and Casual Mode, 50% for the harder difficulties. For example, if the player has 100% Corruption X will be 25 for Normal Mode but 50 for Nightmare Mode. Please note that whenever an Awakened Undead dies, their death will remove the Corruption, accumulated in their Awakening, away from the player. With Cheat Mode enabled you will never gain Corruption. That said, the solutions to combat Corruption will help players slowly overcome it and will allow them to slowly have more and more Awakened Undead with less of the steep penalties. Corruption system should be seen as this mod's sort of "End Game" mechanic where players will be dealing with and overcoming it over the course of their entire playthrough, even after hitting skill level 100.
  
  
  
::NECROMANCER CLASS::
  
  
This is the main skill line for the Necromancy skill. It teaches new spells, perks and rituals which will empower you to control corpses, souls and the undead. Visually it represents the "trunk" of the perk tree and its perks will open access to the classical minion build play style that you know and love.
  
  
  
Novice
  
  

  
* Soul Harvest - This spell directly traps a humanoid soul into the Grimoire without the need of Soul Trap spells and Black Soul Gems.
Necromancer (Necromancy Mastery) (2) - This perk increases the magnitude and duration of Necromancy spells (Reanimations and Undead summons) by 1% per level of Necromancy and will reduce their magicka cost by 50%.
  
* Speak With Dead - This perk allows players to interact with their reanimated thralls while not sneaking via a menu to better customize and manage them and the ability to promote undead. It will also grant all undead minions immunity to the player's destruction spells, attacks and shouts during combat. By undead, this also includes Ordinator's skeletons or any other modded undead minions. With the [Keyword Item Distributor (KID)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55728) patch this protection extends to all hostile spells. If the perk is not enabled, then the mod will simply open up the reanimated thrall's inventory upon interaction.
[Corpse Preparation](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Corpse_Preparation) - This perk allows players to interact with the dead via a menu, perform dissections and dispose corpses. Be warned though, this perk will temporarily become inactive whenever the player has the Ring of Namira equipped, since it interacts with corpses in a similar manner, unequip the Ring of Namira to reactivate interactions with corpses once more. If Hunterborn is detected by Practical Necromancy, then this perk's chapter recipe will be disabled for compatibility reasons.
  
* Anatomical Insights - This is an alternative to "Corpse Preparation" which gives players the ability to craft two uniquely enchanted embalming tools at forges: Necromancer Scalpel and Necromancer Embalming Pick which can be used to avoid or minimize the need to interact with corpses via menus. The Necromancer Scalpel can be used to quickly dissect and harvest ingredients from corpses by simply slashing it a few times, the swings required can be reduced by removing the armor beforehand from the corpse and with higher Necromancy levels. The Necromancer Embalming Pick primarily serves to improve compatibility with other corpse menu mods like CACO and Hunterborn by allowing players to slash the corpse to interact with it instead of activating it directly. These two enchanted embalming tools can be broken down at any enchanting table to learn their enchantments which can then be applied to different weapons for more customization options.
Augury of Death - This perk increases the chance of finding Necromancy related items like Black Soul Gems, Manuscripts and the unique vials necessary for the Create Undead ritual from practitioners of the Dark Arts. This mod considers the following individuals as practitioners of the Dark Arts: any NPC who knows the vanilla reanimation spells (like Necromancers) or anyone who possesses the Necromancy and Dark Souls perks (like the Dragon Priests, Witches and Hagravens). Augury of Death also lets you find these occult items from Vigilants of Stendarr with the idea being that they confiscated them from Necromancers. Please note that the chance for the drop rate of these items vary based on the mod's difficulty setting and applies health debuffs for the harder difficulties of the mod (Hard and Nightmare Modes).
  
* Danse Macabre - This perk will grant 1 additional minion for every 25 Levels of Necromancy. By default, this bonus caps off at 5 additional minions but with Cheat Mode enabled it will ignore the skill level requirement and will be capped at 50 additional minions instead.
Create Undead - Unlocks the Ritual option for the corpse menu from Corpse Preparation and Anatomical Insights that converts a corpse into a Created Undead. This ritual will require specific ingredients like filled black soul gems and unique vials of reagents that can be crafted at cooking pots.
  
* Study - Enables the "Study" option within the dissection menu and unlocks access to [Worm Thralls](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Bestiary_W#Worm_Thrall).
Soul Bind - Enables the "Ritual" option within the grimoire menu and unlocks access to Spectral Thralls.
  
* Anathema - This follower spell allows players to order all of their nearby Promoted Undead and Dominated Thralls to attack a specific target. Anathema has an additional side effect: it will preserve the target's corpse from the following effects that tend to destroy corpses and prevent reanimation: the Wabbajack, disintegration effects from the destruction perks and decapitation.
Catharsis - This spell allows players to dispel ongoing magic effects like reanimation effects on missing reanimated thralls. Please note that it only works outside of combat.
  
* Domination - A necromancy spell which temporarily makes an unbound undead the player's companion or seize control of an enemy necromancer's reanimated thrall. Players will be able to command undead that are either at or below their character level. In addition to this level requirement, the effectiveness or success of commanding an undead with this spell increases with Necromancy skill - the level of a valid target scales by 1% per level of Necromancy. For example, a level 10 player with level 100 Necromancy will now be able to dominate an unbound undead that is level 20 (twice their own level). Domination also shares Anathema's ability to preserve corpses from destruction by the Wabbajack, disintegration effects from the destruction perks and decapitation.
Soul Draw - A unique telekinesis spell that will allow you to not only move inanimate objects, but move corpses as well.
  
* Summon Dead - This spell comes with the Litany of Preservation and allows players to summon Undead Legion to their side.
Radiant Spirit - This perk open up access to a few new spells designed around Spirit Magic.
  
* Spirit Assault - Requires Radiant Spirit, this novice concentration spell deals damage comparable to the vanilla Flames spell (8 damage). Its damage type mirrors the player's affinity.
Bound Spirit Sword - Requires Radiant Spirit, a radiant 1-handed bound sword made of spiritual energy. It is compatible with the Mystic Binding and Oblivion Binding perks.
  
* Bound Spirit Greatsword - Requires Radiant Spirit, a radiant 2-Handed greatsword made of spiritual energy. It is compatible with the Mystic Binding and Oblivion Binding perks.

  
  
Apprentice
  
  

  
* [Cadaver Preparation](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Cadaver_Preparation_Findings) - Once a Promoted Undead is dissected, if any of its viscera or death items are harvested then it will gain increased health regeneration outside of combat. Whenever said thrall is reanimated then their health, magicka and stamina will increase by 100 points.
Awaken Undead - Unlocks a new corpse ritual which grants players the ability to convert a corpse into a permanent minion that ignores the summon limit: "Awakened Undead" at the cost of one Soul. This ritual has two requirements: the corpse must be that of a Created Undead and the corpse needs to be dissected and have any of its viscera removed beforehand. The player gains Corruption - a disease like effect - after the awakening ritual and like a disease it progresses with more undead that are awakened with steeper and steeper debuffs to the player. See the Awakened Undead section for more details.
  
* Litany of Autonomy - This perk unlocks the ability to promote corpses and reanimated thralls to the Undead Guard category.
Agraphia - The Soul Harvest spell will now apply a debuff that halts the target's magicka regeneration. This effectively silences spell casters when paired with shock spells or spells and enchantments that drain magicka.
  
* Summon Undead - This spell allows players to summon Undead Guard to their side.
Liturgical Knowledge - This perk will unlock access to craft some unique weapons, grimoires and armor (that are temperable) at the forge and tanning racks. Please note, that the De Vermis Mysteriis can be broken down to learn its enchantment, so the grimoires that can be crafted with this perk will serve as perfect candidates for this enchantment and will open up more customization options.
  
* Litany of Preservation - This perk unlocks the ability to promote corpses and reanimated thralls to either the Undead Mount or Undead Beast categories. Litany of Preservation also allow players to interact with Undead Mounts and Promoted Mounts while sneaking. Undead Mounts will be banished alive to storage.
Enfeeble - The Soul Harvest spell will now apply a debuff that halts the target's stamina regeneration. Useful in lowering enemies' damage output, especially when paired with frost spells or spells and enchantments that drain stamina.
  
* Summon Mount -This spell summons all of the horses or mounts that were promoted to the Undead Mount category.
Summon Beast - This spell summons all of the undead and corpses that were promoted to the Undead Beast category.
  
* Litany of Ruin - This perk unlocks the ability to promote corpses and reanimated thralls to either the Undead Swarm or Undead Fish categories.
Wither - The Soul Harvest spell will now apply a debuff that reduces the target's resistance to the player's affinity by 0.5% per level of Necromancy. Soul Affinity will instead reduce Magic Resistance by 0.25% per level of Necromancy. While for Blood Affinity, Soul Harvest will shred or debuff 1 Armor Rating per level of Necromancy. For example, a level 50 Necromancer who attuned themself to Frost Affinity will now apply a 25% Weakness to Frost to the enemy with Soul Harvest while another at the same level but with Blood Affinity will now debuff 50 Armor Rating from their targets.
  
* Summon Swarm - This spell summons all of the undead and corpses that were promoted to the Undead Swarm category.
Summon Fish - This spell summons all of the undead and corpses that were promoted to the Undead Fish category.
  
* Esoteric Knowledge - Unlocks the ability to craft Black Soul Gems at the atronach forge from void salts and either a greater or grand soul gem.
Litany of Dominion - This perk unlocks the ability to promote corpses and reanimated thralls to the Undead Aberration category.
  
* Bane - The Soul Harvest spell will now apply a debuff that halts the target's health regeneration. A really useful tool against trolls and modded creatures with combat health regeneration.
Blood Saint - It teaches the ability to craft unique potions called "Bloodstones," which can be used to temporarily buff undead, at cooking pots and "Blood Gems," unique enchanted fist weapons (that are temperable) at the forge with the new learnable Soul Harvest and Anathema enchantments. Please note that these Blood Gems are compatible with "Corpore Sano" of the Anatomist subclass.
  
* Summon Aberration - This spell summons all of the undead and corpses that were promoted to the Undead Aberration category.
Animate Dead - An advanced version of the vanilla "Dead Thrall" spell with a few key differences. It can work on both NPCs and creatures, it eliminates the level cap for reanimated undead and the spell is delivered directly to a single target rather than via a projectile. It also eliminates the flags that label it as "dangerous" so that NPCs won't comment negatively about the spell if it's active. The only caveat to the spell is that you can't reanimate dragons and dwarven automatons for obvious reasons. Affinity alters this spell appearance.
  
* Subjugate Ghost - This works just like Animate Dead in every way, however, it is different in that it allows players to reanimate a corpse with a ghostly appearance instead. Affinity will morph this spell's appearance, for instance, players with Frost affinity will reanimate a chilly ghost.
Banishment - This spell allows players to remotely banish their undead. It can be paired with Memento Mori to remotely banish all of the player's nearby Promoted Undead. Unpromoted reanimated thralls will simply die on the spot if targeted with this spell.
  
* Consecration - This spell allows players to remotely apply potions to their Promoted Undead.
Dismissal - This spell remotely kills the player's undead. It can be paired with Memento Mori to kill off all of the player's nearby Promoted Undead.
  
* Memento Mori - This power casts non-hostile spells (like reanimation, magelight and armor spells) held in the player's right hand onto all of the player's nearby Promoted Undead. Harder difficulties of the mod like Hard Mode and Nightmare Mode will require 1 "Soul" per cast.
Necrotic Affinity - This power grants the ability to switch affinities. The player's current affinity can be tracked from the active effects tab.
  
* Anima Ligature - Grants players the ability to cast the Soul Harvest spell on strike with the Bound Spirit Weapons learned from the core Necromancer perk: Radiant Spirit.
Spirit Rune - Requires Radiant Spirit, an apprentice destruction rune spell which deals damage similar to the vanilla Fire Rune (50 damage). Its damage type mirrors the player's affinity.
  
* [Soul Snare](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:N%27Gasta) - This necromancy spell binds the soul of an enemy to your will upon their death, it behaves similar to the way soul trap requires the target to die while the spell is active. The soul is "animated" by the reanimation spell "Subjugate Ghost." This soul will be promoted to Undead Legion automatically and will benefit from the advanced features of this mod.
Spirit Strike - Requires Radiant Spirit, this apprentice destruction spell deals damage comparable to the vanilla Firebolt spell (25 damage). Its damage type mirrors the player's affinity.
  

  
  
Adept
  
  

  
* Votary - Awakened Undead will lower the player's Corruption whenever they kill opponents that are stronger (higher level) than themselves. This will be a boon to players who actually lean into the Necromancy roleplay (take the time to improve their undead) and will open up access to more Awakened Undead with less of the debilitating debuffs. The perk also grants 50% Corruption Resistance.
Epigone - Awaken Undead ritual permanently teaches the Awakened Undead the spells held in the player's left and right hands. Perform the ritual without spells equipped to make said minion forget their memorized spells or not learn any.
  
* Necrotic Inoculation - This perk grants Promoted Undead immunity to damage from the player's affinity. For example, players who switched to Shock Affinity will now have Promoted Undead that are completely immune to shock spells. Soul Affinity will grant a 25% magic resistance instead since there isn't a corresponding "soul" resistance. With Blood Affinity, Promoted Undead will gain 150 Armor Rating. Please note that this perk only takes hold on Promoted Minions once their viscera is removed and harvested. The perk applies magicka debuffs to the player for the harder difficulties of the mod (Hard and Nightmare Modes).
Dark Investiture - Promoted Undead will inherit a few of the player's perks: Corpore Sano, Anchorite, Vivisectionist, Ascendant and Blood Adept after their viscera is removed. This of course depends on whether the player actually knows the perks. This perk is limited to native undead to the Create Undead ritual, however the [Spell Perk Item Distributor (SPID)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869) patch will make it possible to dynamically apply this buff to all Promoted Undead.
  
* Possession - This spell makes it possible to take control of the body of either a Promoted Undead or Dominated Thrall. In the case of Dominated Thralls this can be used in a strategic way to kill them. Sheathing one's weapons will quickly cancel the possession.
Spirit Burst - Requires Radiant Spirit, this adept destruction AoE spell. It was inspired by the [Soul Burst](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Soulburst). It parallels the vanilla adept spell Fireball in that a projectile is fired and explodes on impact. Spirit Burst's explosion deals 1 point of damage for every Soul that is stored in the Grimoire.
  

  
  
Expert
  
  

  
* Anchorite - This perk uncaps the summon limit for players by tying it to magicka. Starting from 200 base magicka, the player gains an additional reanimated thrall. From then on every 100 points of magicka will grant another minion. This of course means that those who truly want to become a powerful necromancer will need to invest heavily in magicka and less in health resulting in a squishy character which I'd like to think is a fair trade off.
Resurrection - This spell allows players to resurrect the dead. It can be used to awaken undead that qualify for the Awakening ritual, but with a catch - the Awakened Undead will not gain the features of the Awaken Undead ritual.
  
* Spirit Shred - Requires Radiant Spirit, this apprentice destruction spell deals damage comparable to the vanilla Incinerate spell (75 damage). Its damage type mirrors the player's affinity.

  
  
Master
  
  

  
* Eremite - This perk is identical to the vanilla Necromage perk - it grants a 25% strength increase and 50% duration increase to all spells against undead - and will boost spells for the player if they are flagged as undead (via vampirism or lichdom with mods). Eremite was designed for those who missed the way that the Necromage perk worked before the Unofficial Skyrim Patch nerfed it.

  
  
  
::NECROMANCER SUBCLASSES::
  
  
If the Necromancer Class can be described as the "trunk" of the perk tree, then this section will discuss the "branches." Practical Necromancy offers ways to make more unique Necromancer builds and comes with four subclasses with additional perks that lean into the four fundamental Necromancer playstyles: Theurgist, Anatomist, Animist and Thaumaturge. First of all, Necromancy at its core is a very crafting oriented field. This goes all the way back to [Sauron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauron) who served Aulë, the smith of the Valar, and his [One Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Ring) which was crafted and enchanted to rule and dominate Arda. Mannimarco, the Elder Scrolls equivalent to Sauron, likewise has a penchant for artifacts and powerful enchantments like the [Bloodworm Helm](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Bloodworm_Helm), [Necromancer Amulet](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Necromancer%27s_Amulet) and the [Staff of Worms](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Staff_of_Worms). As such, the very first perk for each of this mod's subclasses has a strong emphasis on the crafting skills: [Alchemy](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Marzula-jo%27s_Notes), [Smithing](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dark_Anchors) and [Enchanting](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Souls,_Black_and_White).
  
  
It is also a well known fact that Necromancy touches on the [different schools](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Black_Arts_On_Trial) of magic. For instance, a Necromancer with an intimate understanding of anatomy can become an incredible [healer](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Exodus) or even a deadly assassin or skilled destruction mage. A Necromancer who manipulates the souls of the dead can channel those souls into not just soul gems but also [constructs](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Snorfin) or even use [blood](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Blood_Magic) as a source of power. Another Necromancer with a keen mind can channel their craft into making a target susceptible to their mind altering spells or debilitating afflictions.
  
  
While Necromancy can be used to [prepare corpses](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Corpse_Preparation), [bind souls](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Practical_Necromancy), [create undead](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Cadaver_Preparation_Findings) and even [create clones](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Divayth_Fyr) - it can also be channeled inwards to improve oneself and ones craft. After all, the lore makes it very clear that Necromancy can be used to extend ones life either through [natural](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dratha) or by [unnatural](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Ascendancy:_Pathway_to_Lichdom) means. Hence the reason why this mod's subclass perks progressively become less focused on improving minions the higher you ascend them and more focused on improving oneself - the ultimate goal of Necromancers.
  
  
I really hope that these subclasses will open up your mind to what is possible with Necromancy. Necromancy is a science and like any science it can be applied in the real world. If you are a creative person and lean into the Necromancer roleplay then the possibilities are endless.

* Scapegoat (Adept) - When Corrupted the Anathema spell will reduce the player's corruption slightly once the target dies.
Spiritualist (Adept) - If the player is not Corrupted (has 0% Corruption) Conjuration spells will last 1.5% longer per Necromancy level.
  
* Ascendant (Expert) - All spells (across the schools of magic) will gain 1% spell potency per 40 points of Magicka (equal to 0.025% of the player's current Magicka). For example, if the player has this perk and 1000 points of Magicka then their spells will be 25% stronger. Additionally, all spells last 1% longer per level of Necromancy whenever a location's affinity matches the player's affinity.

[font=Times New Roman]::CORPSE MENU::[/font]
  
  
This section covers the various menu options that become available after the player learns the "Corpse Preparation" perk and interacts with a corpse while sneaking or with a swing of the embalming pick obtained via the "Anatomical Insights" perk. Each perk unlocks advanced interaction with all corpses with the exception of dragons and dwarven automatons. Those who have used [Hunterborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7900) in the past will have a better idea of what to expect as it's similar in a lot of ways. Please note that because of the way that the Ring of Namira interacts with corpses, this perk will temporarily go inactive (by design) if you have that ring equipped, so unequip the ring if you wish to reactivate this option.
  
  
Spoiler

  
* Search - This allows players to loot corpses.
Dissect - Grants players the ability to dissect corpses to harvest ingredients and perform other tasks. The individual menu options for dissections will be explained in the "Corpse Dissection" section. Alternatively, the scalpel crafted via the "Anatomical Insights" perk can be swung at a corpse a few times to perform this action.
  
* Cast - Grants players the option of casting reanimation and resurrection spells with their "Souls" instantly via the menu instead of casting it with magicka. Casting those spells via the menu will be the only way that an unexperienced necromancer can cast those spells until they unlock the actual spells from the grimoire. It also allows players to dispel any ongoing magic effects.
Ritual - Allows players to perform corpse rituals.
  
* Create Undead - This ritual opens up the ability to create skeletal, corporeal, incorporeal and accursed undead.
Awaken Undead - This ritual allows players to convert Created Undead that has had their viscera removed beforehand (via the dissection and harvest systems) into Awakened Undead, minions that exist without time limits and ignore the player's summon limit.
  
* Promote - This option allows players to promote or demote undead from the different categories and optionally transfer them to the "Clean Up" category. All corpses that reside within the "Clean Up" category will be automatically disposed the next time that the player decides to use the "Dispose" button or whenever the player creates more undead.
Dispose - Allows players to safely dispose vanilla corpses and the corpses of the undead that were created with this mod. Please note that whenever you wish to remove your Promoted Undead, disposing them will automatically demote them and then immediately dispose them.
  
* Debug - This is an option that's only visible if Debugging Mode is enabled from within the grimoire's settings. It will attempt to fix any bug (vanilla or otherwise) that is affecting a specific corpse like the moonwalking bug.
Cancel - Allows players to exit the corpse preparation menu.

[font=Times New Roman]::DISSECTION MENU::[/font]
  
  
This section goes into more detail for the dissection menu which can be accessed via the corpse preparation menu. It unlocks a few options that are only made available after a dissection is performed and the player interacts with the dissected corpse while sneaking with the "Corpse Preparation" perk or with a swing of the embalming pick after the corpse has been dissected with the scalpel (both tools obtained via the "Anatomical Insights" perk). Please be warned though the act of dissection will mutilate a corpse in such a way that it can't be used in the creation of undead, however, the corpse can be reanimated and resurrected since those spells "repair" the dissected corpse. Please note that because of the way that the Ring of Namira interacts with corpses, this perk will temporarily go inactive (by design) if you have that ring equipped, so unequip the ring if you wish to reactivate this option.
  
  
Spoiler

  
* Search - This allows players to loot corpses.
Harvest - This option allows players to harvest rare ingredients from certain corpses. Players can harvest hearts and flesh from humanoids, daedra hearts from dremora and lurkers, powdered mammoth tusks from mammoths, spriggan sap and taproot from spriggans, troll fat from trolls, vampire dust from vampires, bonemeal from draugr, ectoplasm from the spectral draugr, bonemeal and a skull from skeletons. Players can also extract a Vial of Tainted Blood from vampires which is a main component needed to create accursed undead. Alternatively, the scalpel crafted via the "Anatomical Insights" perk can be swung at a corpse a few times to perform this action.
  
* Study - Players can store information regarding the anatomy of a dissected corpse on one of three scrolls (and a fourth unique scroll which is only unlocked when Cheat mode is enabled). These scrolls can then be referenced to create clones of the dissected corpse, called "Worm Thralls" via the "Create Undead" ritual.
Stats - This option allows players to view more information about the corpse in question and only becomes available to corpses that have been dissected first for obvious reasons.
  
* Cast - Allows players to cast reanimation and resurrection spells with "Souls" via the menu instead of magicka. It also allows players to dispel temporary magic effects.
Ritual - Allows players to perform the corpse rituals.
  
* Create Undead - This ritual opens up the ability to create skeletal, corporeal, incorporeal and accursed undead.
Awaken Undead - This ritual allows players to convert Created Undead that has had their viscera removed beforehand (via the dissection and harvest systems) into Awakened Undead, minions that exist without time limits and ignore the player's summon limit.
  
* Promote - This option allows players to remove undead from the different categories and optionally transfer them to the "Clean Up" category. All corpses that reside within the "Clean Up" category will be disposed the next time that the player decides to use the "Dispose" button. Corpses within the "Clean Up" category will also be disposed automatically whenever the player creates new undead.
Dispose - Allows players to safely dispose vanilla corpses and the corpses of the undead that were created with this mod. Please note that whenever you wish to get rid of your Promoted Undead, disposing them will automatically demote them and then immediately dispose them.
  
* Debug - This is an option that's only visible if Debug Mode is enabled. It will attempt to fix any bug that is affecting a specific corpse.
Cancel - Allows players to exit the corpse dissection menu.

[font=Times New Roman]::FOLLOWER MENU::[/font]
  
  
Reanimated thralls will have more options than vanilla should the player learn the Speak With Dead perk. This perk, as its name suggests, aims to work just like a follower overhaul but for the undead and opens up more options to customize and carefully tweak reanimated undead. Click on the spoilers below for a preview on what is possible in this menu interaction.
  
  
Spoiler

  
* Trade - Allows players to exchange items with reanimated thralls.
Equipment - This option allows players to order the reanimated thralls to equip weapons and armor and even order them to drink potions. It has a built-in outfit system which allows players to create new and permanent outfits based on what armor the thralls were ordered to wear. The outfit system also comes with a pre-made version of Tsun's outfit that male NPCs can use, as well as a "blank" outfit should players want Created Undead to specifically use the best items alone and not revert to their default outfit.
  
* Command - Issues simple commands to reanimated thralls like "Dismiss" which kills the thrall automatically, "Banish" which sends Promoted Undead to storage and "Stop Combat" which does as its name suggests. Awakened Undead have more commands like wait, follow, guard, etc.
Stats - Allows players to view detailed stats on the reanimated thrall like the thrall's level, health, magicka, stamina, resistances, skill levels and more.
  
* Cast - Grants players the ability to dispel magic effects. It also allows players to cast non-hostile spells, that are equipped on either their right or left hand, on the reanimated thrall. This feature can be used to apply healing spells, armor spells, light spells, buffs and other utility spells. It is recommended that players stick to simple fire and forget spells and avoid concentration spells.
Ritual - Allows players to perform the Soul Bind ritual.
  
* Soul Bind - A ritual that allows players to memorize how to create a specific reanimated thrall, by binding its soul to one of three scrolls (and a fourth unique scroll which is only unlocked when Cheat mode is enabled). These scrolls can then be referenced to create incorporeal clones of said thrall, called "Spectral Thralls" via the "Create Undead" ritual.
Promote - Allows players to promote reanimated thralls to the different categories or demote them. These categories will be elaborated on in the last few sections.
  
* Debug - This option only becomes visible if Debugging Mode is enabled. It will attempt to fix any bugs that are affecting a reanimated thrall.
Nevermind - Kicks players out of the follower menu.

[font=Times New Roman]::UNDEAD PROMOTION::[/font]
  
  
  
::PROMOTED UNDEAD::
  
  
Whenever a reanimation spell is cast on a corpse the mod automatically promotes them to the Undead Legion category (this feature can be toggled off in the mod's settings). Players can also manually promote corpses or reanimated thralls via the corpse and undead menus to the Undead Legion category. This is the default category that will allow players to in turn summon them (via the Summon Dead spell). Aside from the Undead Legion there are more categories available that are unlocked via four perks: Litany of Autonomy (Undead Guard), Litany of Preservation (Undead Mount and Undead Beast), Litany of Ruin (Undead Swarm and Undead Fish) and the Litany of Dominion (Undead Aberration). Promoted Undead as a whole offers the following features:
  
  

  
* They have smarter AI in general and are more aggressive in combat.
They will pull out their weapons whenever you do and will automatically equip the best armor and weapons in their inventory.
  
* They will sneak whenever the player sneaks.
They will ignore friendly fire from allies during combat.
  
* They all have the [Light Foot](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Sneak#Light_Foot) perk, so they won't trigger traps. Requires the [Spell Perk Item Distributor (SPID)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869) patch in the download section.
They all have the AlchemySkillBoosts and PerkSkillBoosts perks which will allow them to benefit from potions and enchantments that boost skills. Requires the [Spell Perk Item Distributor (SPID)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869) patch in the download section.
  
* They are all immune to fall damage. Requires the [Spell Perk Item Distributor (SPID)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869) patch in the download section.
They will not flee from combat even if they were promoted from NPCs that generally flee from combat.
  
* Their health regenerates quickly over time outside of combat. Requires the Cadaver Preparation perk.
They gain a bonus 100 points to health, stamina and magicka once reanimated. Requires the Cadaver Preparation perk.
  
* They gain 100% resistance to poison and disease resistance with a 50% resistance to frost.
They are now immune to paralysis, disintegration, decapitation and the Wabbajack - effects that tend the hinder the ability to reanimate corpses.
  
* They can water breathe just like other vanilla undead.
They can be summoned to the player: Undead Legion (Summon Dead), Undead Guard (Summon Undead), Undead Mount (Summon Mount), Undead Beast (Summon Beast), Undead Swarm (Summon Swarm), Undead Fish (Summon Fish) and Undead Aberration (Summon Aberration).
  
* They can be banished to storage via the "Commands" option of the "Speak With Dead" perk. Please note that they will be killed automatically just before being banished and then teleported to storage, however, Awakened Undead are unique in that they will be banished alive instead.
They can be issued simple orders like killing specific targets of the "Anathema" spell.
  
* They can be manually controlled with the "Possession" spell.
Their reanimation effect shaders will not persist across loading screens, as is the case with the vanilla game, however, there is a setting available in the mod that will allow players to enable a fix that preserves these shaders specifically for Promoted Undead.
  
* A maximum of 50 corpses or undead can be promoted.
The number of undead within this category can be tracked via the "Stats" option from the grimoire's menu.

::CLEAN UP::
  
  
Corpses of Created Undead can be removed from the unique promotion categories via the "Demote" option and sent to the Clean Up category. Corpses sent to this category will be reserved for the mod's built-in clean up system to prevent the likelihood of save bloating.
  
  

  
* Promoted Undead that are disposed are automatically demoted to this category from their undead category and are then disposed.
They are reserved for the next clean up cycle should the player decides to "demote" them into this category.
  
* Corpses within this category are automatically cleaned up each time the player disposes a corpse.
Corpses within this category gets purged automatically each time the player creates new undead.
  
* Players can schedule a cleanup cycle via the "Debug Mod" option from the grimoire's menu.
The clean up system safely disposes vanilla and modded corpses without destroying the spawn points for enemies. Practical Necromancy will delete disposed Created Undead to prevent save bloat but will dispose (vanilla and modded) corpses by sending them to the same vanilla utility cell that Skyrim uses to discard NPCs from radiant world encounters.
  
* A maximum of 25 bodies can be sent to this category at once.
The number of corpses within this category can be tracked via the "Stats" option from the grimoire's menu.
  

  
Due to the fact that one of the three triggers to initiate a cleanup cycle is the act of disposing a corpse, players should make it a habit to routinely dispose the corpses of created undead that they are not using anymore, instead of just leaving them around. If the corpse is one of the player's favorites, then the player can opt to "record" that corpse in the grimoire with either one of the mod's cloning systems like the Study system via corpse dissection or the Soul Bind system via the Soul Bind ritual accessed from the Speak With Dead's menu.
  
  
  
  
[font=Times New Roman]::CREATE UNDEAD RITUAL::[/font]
  
  
  
::CREATED UNDEAD::
  
  
The Create Undead ritual grants players the ability to create 36 different types of undead which becomes 96 unique undead once the different classes of these undead types are taken into account. There are a few differences between the undead created with this mod and the ones from vanilla.
  
  

  
* They immediately join the Undead Legion category and inherit all of the features of Promoted Undead.
They can be given outfits.
  
* They scale with the player's level, so will remain useful at higher levels.
They have been set to not break the player's stealth if the player is sneaking.
  
* They all have the [Light Foot](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Sneak#Light_Foot) perk, so they won't trigger traps.
They all have the AlchemySkillBoosts and PerkSkillBoosts perks which will allow them to benefit from potions and enchantments that boost skills.
  
* They are all immune to fall damage.
Incorporeal undead created by this mod won't disintegrate on death and leave ash piles.
  
* The player can't resurrect Created Undead with the exception of those who were awakened before.
New undead can't be made from created undead, but undead can be upgraded to greater undead if they have an upgradable option in the Create Undead ritual.
  

  
The player can craft four types of undead: skeletal, corporeal, incorporeal and accursed via the Create Undead ritual, which requires the acquisition of a few ingredients beforehand. While the secondary ingredients for each undead type will vary, there are four main reagents that are required to perform the ritual:
  
  

  
* Vial of Corrosive Liquid - This concoction quickly dissolves the corpse's flesh in rituals to create skeletal undead.
Vial of Embalming Fluid - This is used to preserve the corpses of fleshy or corporeal undead.
  
* Vial of Nightshade Oil - This oil is used to anoint corpses for rituals that create incorporeal undead.
Vial of Tainted Blood - This defiled blood is used to create accursed undead - creatures that have been infected with the curse of vampirism.
  

  
The reagents above can all be crafted at cooking pots, with the exception of the Vial of Tainted Blood which can be harvested from dissected vampires. A complete list of all the different undead types that can be created in this mod can be found below.
  
  

![](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/29834/29834-1730667004-627848900.jpeg)

  
  
::SKELETAL UNDEAD::
  
  

  
* Skeleton - Created from the corpses of NPCs. Five different skeleton types can be created based on the classes of the corpses, for instance, one can create skeleton archers from the bodies of those who were skilled in archery. Aside from archers one can create two-handers, one-handers, one-handers with a shield and a spell caster from the body of someone who was skilled with destruction magic.
Corrupted Shade - Players can create 3 different types of corrupted shades - one Stormcloak shade from dead Stormcloaks, an Imperial shade from the corpses of Imperial soldiers and a generic shade from the bodies of those who were unaligned in the Civil War. Just as with the case of Skeletons above each type has 5 different classes, giving players the opportunity to raise a total of 15 different corrupted shades.
  
* Boneman - Created from the corpses of NPCs. Four different classes of Bonemen are available, with the mage archetype not being one of them.
Mistman - Created from the corpses of NPCs.
  
* Wrathman - Created from the corpses of NPCs.
Keeper - Created from the corpses of Giants. Four different classes of keepers are available, with no mages available
  
* Corrupted Shade Priest - Upgraded from generic Corrupted Shades of the mage class.

  
  
::CORPOREAL UNDEAD::
  
  

  
* Draugr - Created from dead NPCs. Five different Draugr are possible based on the classes of the corpses that were used, for instance, a Draugr that favors two handed weapons can be created from an NPC that favors the two-handed skill (just like in the case with Skeletons and Corrupted Shades above). This rule applies for all other Draugr types below as well.
Clone - Creates a clone of any corpse.
  
* Forsworn Briarheart - Created from dead NPCs. Unlike the other corporeal undead the deceased NPC must be a male. Five different classes are available for Briarhearts.
Worm Thrall - Created from dead NPCs and by referencing scrolls with the anatomical sketches of corpses recorded from studying corpses after they were dissected. This undead is a corporeal clone of the subject that was dissected.
  
* Restless Draugr - Created from dead NPCs.
Draugr Wight - Created from dead NPCs.
  
* Draugr Scourge - Created from dead NPCs.
Ash Spawn - Created from dead NPCs.
  
* Hulking Draugr - Created from dead NPCs.
Draugr Deathlord - Created from dead NPCs.
  
* Draugr Overlord - Upgraded from Restless Draugr.
Draugr Wight Lord - Upgraded from Draugr Wight.
  
* Draugr Scourge Lord - Upgraded from Draugr Scourge.
Draugr Death Overlord - Upgraded from Draugr Deathlord.
  
* Dragon Priest - Upgraded from Draugr Death Overlord.
Corrupted Thrall - Created from the templates of broken minions that automatically get disposed by the mod. These thralls are managed by the "Requiem" ritual.
  

  
  
::INCORPOREAL UNDEAD::
  
  

  
* Spectral Draugr - Created from dead NPCs, just as with the case with other Draugr, one can create five different classes of this type of undead based on the class and equipment of the deceased NPC.
Subjugated Ghost - Created from male dead NPCs, five different classes of ghosts can be produced based on the class and equipment of the corpse that the ritual is performed on.
  
* Spectral Horse - Created from dead horses. This horse has been set to use the same meshes and textures that Arvak uses. This means that Spectral Horses will inherit the appearance of Arvak from Arvak mods like my [Better Arvak](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29833) mod, however, they won't inherit any of the passive and active spells from that mod. The auras of Spectral Horses will adapt to the player's affinity, meaning frost affinity will result in a frosty spectral horse.
Spectral Thrall - Created from dead NPCs and by binding the souls of reanimated thralls via the "Soul Bind" ritual. These souls are bound to scrolls which can then be referenced in a way that's similar to Worm Thralls.
  
* Spectral Warhound - Created from dead canine like dogs, wolves and huskies.
Headless Horseman - Created from male dead NPCs.
  
* Wisp - Created from any corpse.
Ice Wraith - Created from any corpse.
  
* Wispmother - Created from dead female NPCs.

  
  
::ACCURSED UNDEAD::
  
  

  
* Frozen Falmer - Created from dead Falmer. Five different classes can be raised based on the combat style that the Falmer had in life.
Death Hound - Created from dead canine like dogs, wolves and huskies.
  
* Frozen Chaurus - Created from dead Chaurus.
Gargoyle - Created from dead Trolls and other Gargoyles.
  
* Gargoyle Brute - Created from dead Trolls and other Gargoyles.
Gargoyle Sentinel - Created from dead Trolls and other Gargoyles.
  
* Gargoyle Sentinel Lord - Upgraded from Gargoyle Sentinels.

  
  
[font=Times New Roman]::AWAKEN UNDEAD RITUAL::[/font]
  
  
The Awaken Undead ritual becomes unlocked with the perk of the same name. It will allow players to create Permanent Undead called Awakened Undead that are not limited by timers or contribute to the player's summon limits. This freedom comes at a price though in the form of Corruption, a disease like status, that imposes steep debuffs with each Awakened Undead that is brought into the world. Here are a few unique properties of Awakened Undead.
  
  
::AWAKENED UNDEAD::
  
  

  
* Once the Awaken Undead ritual is performed the Awakened Undead will inherit the same base health, base stamina, base magicka and base skill levels as the player in every instance that their current stats are lower than those of the player. For example, a Created Undead with 20 health will inherit the same 100 health of the player after its awakened, while a Created Undead with level 100 One Handed will not inherit the level 15 One Handed skill of the player.
They can be taught spells by the player. Requires the Epigone perk.
  
* Unlike Promoted Undead that are reanimated, Awakened Undead will be banished to storage alive and will be summoned from storage alive.
They can be issued commands like wait and follow.
  
* They can be posted at the player's home or lair and be ordered to guard and sandbox the area.
When set to Follow mode, Awakened Undead will remain silent, however, in Scout Mode they will use idle dialogues and react audibly to the player's actions.
  
* If they were issued commands but were summoned, they will forget their last orders and automatically follow the player.

[font=Times New Roman]::INSTALLATION::[/font]
  
  
First of all, do not compact this mod's .esp file or flag it as an .esl file, doing so might break the scripts in the mod, so please keep it as an untouched .esp file. For non-English speakers, if you use a translation of the mod then only use a translation for the latest version of Practical Necromancy or download an older version of Practical Necromancy that matches the version of the translation that is available to you. If you use an outdated translation with the latest version of this mod then the menus will more than likely not work properly. Finally, if you play with the older versions of Skyrim (like Skyrim 1.5.97 and Skyrim 1.6.640) then you will need to use [Backported Extended ESL Support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441) as well or [Skyrim VR ESL Support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106712) for VR.
  
  
Before enabling the mod in your load order please kill off any reanimated thralls that you might have with you and make a save or a few saves. It is important that you make a backup save before installing this mod, because this mod makes use of scripts and will corrupt your save should you decide to uninstall the mod on an ongoing save. This pre-installation backup save should be reloaded and used if you want to safely uninstall the mod at a later time. While save cleaners may be another option, I cannot vouch for how reliable they can be in cleaning orphan scripts from your save and might actually make things worse. After making a pre-installation save to rollback to, should you change your mind about using the mod, then you can install the mod virtually with your preferred mod manager.
  
  
Download and install the main file (Practical Necromancy) and any ONE of the [Custom Skills Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41780) patches (Practical Necromancy - CSF Patch) from the download section if you would like to get the perk tree:
  
  
INSIGHT
  
  
This CSF patch uses a new resource called Insight which will be used to unlock perks on the perk tree. This is the most balanced option.
  
  
PERK POINT
  
  
This CSF patch uses the same perk points that you gain from level ups to unlock perks on the perk tree. This option is balanced but mods that add a lot of perk points can make your experience a lot easier.
  
  
SOUL
  
  
This CSF patch uses Souls from the mod to unlock perks on the perk tree. Souls are pretty simple to obtain, making this the least balanced option with the easiest experience.
  
  
If you are using Skyrim Skill Uncapper then you need to use this version [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/82558) because that is the only version of that mod that works with Custom Skills Framework and you will need to download the "Custom Skills Framework for 1.5.97" file from Custom Skills Framework's downloads. If you are playing with the older or newer versions of CSF and happen to have [Custom Skills Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62423) then specifically use any CSF Patch in the Practical Necromancy's downloads that explicitly states that it is compatible with old and new versions of Custom Skills Framework (the uppermost Practical Necromancy - CSF Patch in the downloads).
  
  
Only use the other CSF Patch that works specifically for the latest version of Custom Skills Framework if you have the unofficial update to Custom Skills Menu, [Denji's Custom Skills Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/130095). If you are playing with the newer versions of CSF (like CSF 3.0+) and don't use [Custom Skills Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62423) then you are free to use any CSF Patch but you will only be able to access the perk tree via the Grimoire.
  
  
Finally, there are other patches in the downloads section as well, so take your time and download and install the ones that you need. Once in-game you will learn the "Summon Grimoire" power soon after you reanimate your first corpse with the mod enabled.
  
  
  
[font=Times New Roman]::UPDATING::[/font]
  
  
First of all, kill off all of your undead minions or at least banish all of them before updating and make a save. Once again for non-English speakers, if you use a translation of the mod then only use a translation that matches the latest version of Practical Necromancy. Also if you play with the older versions of Skyrim (Skyrim 1.5.97 to Skyrim 1.6.640) then you will need to use [Backported Extended ESL Support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441) as well.
  
  
You can update the mod by reinstalling it with the updated version through your mod manager or by manually deleting the mod and installing it again with the updated version. Once in-game equip the grimoire to enter the grimoire's menu, you will see a new option available called "Update Mod." Click this option and wait for it to complete to finalize the mod's update in-game.
  
  
  
  
[font=Times New Roman]::UNINSTALLATION::[/font]
  
  
This mod has scripts and shouldn't be uninstalled on an ongoing save that had the mod enabled. If you decide to uninstall the mod, then uninstall it and revert to the pre-installation save(s) that was made by following the Installation procedure above.

[font=Times New Roman]::MOD COMPATIBILITY::[/font]
  
  
Practical Necromancy will serve as a good companion mod to the popular perk overhauls. It was designed with compatibility in mind and load order shouldn't matter if you use these mods. If in doubt about load order simply load this mod after these:

[font=Times New Roman]::SLIGHTLY COMPATIBLE MODS::[/font]
  
  

  
* [Requiem - The Roleplaying Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60888) - Position Practical Necromancy below Requiem so that its ReanimateAshPile file overrides Requiem's ReanimateAshPile file in order to ensure that reanimated thralls remain intact when they die. Or do the opposite, move Practical Necromancy above Requiem if you would like reanimated thralls to disintegrate upon death, but beware though you will need to invest a couple perks in Requiem's Conjuration tree and require a level 75 Conjuration perk to reverse that decision.
[Adamant - A Perk Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30191) - Use the Adamant - Disable Inventory Menu Patch over at my [Patch Hub](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/165727) to prevent Adamant from automatically opening up the reanimated thrall's inventory whenever you interact with them.
  
* [Simply Order Summons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66919) - Both mods bring up overlapping menus when you communicate with undead, please use the Simply Order Summons - Disable Dialogue Menu Patch over at my [Patch Hub](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/165727) if you would like to use both mods at the same time.
[Skyrim Souls RE - Updated](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27859) - Skyrim Souls makes navigation through this mod's menus very tedious by disabling the arrow keys and forcing players to use their mouse to click on each option. Open SkyrimSoulsRE.ini, change the bEnableMovementInMenus setting under the "Controls" section from true to false - this re-enables the arrow keys while in Practical Necromancy's menus or use the Skyrim Souls - Disable Movement In Menus Patch over at my [Patch Hub](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/165727) which makes that INI tweak for you.
  
* [Nether's Follower Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55653) - Becomes fully compatible once the "Minion Support" setting is disabled in its MCM. Practical Necromancy acts like a follower framework as well but for the undead, so please make that tweak to ensure that Practical Necromancy has total control over your undead. Alternatively, you can use the Nether's Follower Framework - Disable Minion Patch over at my [Patch Hub](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/165727) which will automatically change those settings for you.
[Simple Hunting Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/95943) - You can either position Practical Necromancy just below Simple Hunting Overhaul so that its ReanimateAshPile.pex file overwrites the same file within Simple Hunting Overhaul or use the Practical Necromancy - SHO Patch in this mod's download section. The ReanimateAshPile.pex file within Simple Hunting Overhaul just removes the pelts from your animals soon after reanimating them, but you can do that manually yourself before reanimating them which makes the option of just letting Practical Necromancy win the conflict, a valid option.
  
* [Hunterborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7900) - The Corpse Preparation perk conflicts with Hunterborn when sneaking, changing Hunterborn's MCM settings to interact with carcasses via activating instead of sneaking will bypass the conflict. Alternatively, you can use the Anatomical Insights perk to interact with carcasses by slashing them with its enchanted embalming tools. Please remember that those tools can be crafted at the forge once Anatomical Insights is unlocked.
Mods that edit the ReanimateSecondayFFAimed and ReanimateSecondayTargetActor magic effects in an attempt to block the creation of ash piles from dead reanimated thralls. Practical Necromancy's ability to preserve reanimated corpses will override mods that do this regardless of load order.
  
* Mods that edit the ReanimateAshPile script within the ReanimateSecondayFFAimed and ReanimateSecondayTargetActor magic effects which tries to prevent the creation of ash piles from dead reanimated thralls like [Necromancy 101](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40836). This is a similar scenario to [Requiem](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60888) above, positioning Practical Necromancy so that its ReanimateAshPile.pex file overrides that other mod's ReanimateAshPile.pex will maintain Practical Necromancy's ability to both preserve reanimated corpses and maintain full control over the AI for reanimated thralls.

  
[font=Times New Roman]::INCOMPATIBLE MODS::[/font]
  
  

  
* Skyrim 1.5.97, Skyrim 1.6.659 or any version in between - Use [Backported Extended ESL Support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441) to ensure that The Dark Arts.esp file is actually recognized and loaded by the game.
[Better Dead Thralls](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10756) - This necromancy overhaul works very similar to Practical Necromancy, so you should choose one instead.
  
* [Dead and Daedric Guardians](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/87897) - Practical Necromancy offers a similar harvest system and features the ability to give minions commands. Consider using D&D Guardians instead if you are less interested in a necromancy overhaul but more interested in having permanent unique daedra, undead, automatons and dragon minions.
[Dead NPC Body Cleaner Remover](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10614) - This will make your dead bodies disappear which is bad, so avoid mods like this whenever you play a Necromancer. Skyrim already has a natural disposal system through cell resets. Outside of Necromancy, mods like this tend to create more trouble than they are worth like potentially deleting the spawn points of enemies, breaking quests by deleting bodies with quest items in their inventory and introducing stability issues in the long term. Please use Practical Necromancy's body disposal system instead if you find a body that is somehow not getting cleaned up naturally by the game.
  

  
If you found any conflicting mods, then please send me a message, so I can list the conflicting mod by name within this compatibility section for the sake of other users.
  
  
  
[font=Times New Roman]::NOTE TO PATCHERS AND MOD AUTHORS::[/font]
  
  

  
* In order to improve the compatibility of modded destruction spells with the Necrotic Bloom perk: Add either the MDAMagicDamageDisease or MagicAlchWeaknessMagic keywords to any disease damage destruction spell's magic effects. Add either the MDAMagicDamagePoison or MagicAlchHarmful keywords to any poison damage destruction spell's magic effects. Add either the MDAMagicDamageMagic or MagicAlchResistMagic keywords to any pure magic damage destruction spell's magic effects.
In order to improve the compatibility of modded blood or absorb spells with the Blood Seal perk: Add either the MDAMagicDamageBlood or MagicVampireDrain keyword to any of the spell's magic effects.
  
* In order to extend the friendly fire protection from the Speak With Dead perk to modded minions, those mods just need to either have the ActorTypeUndead keyword attached to the undead's Actorbase or attached to the Race record for that particular minion.

  
  
  
  
[font=Times New Roman]::KNOWN ISSUES::[/font]
  
  

  
* There are some who install the mod and have The Dark Arts.esp file enabled but cannot obtain the grimoire by reanimating a corpse. If you are playing with Skyrim 1.5.97, Skyrim 1.6.659 or any version in between then you will need to use [Backported Extended ESL Support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441) so that your older version of the game will actually load this mod in your load order properly.
There are some who fail to obtain the grimoire after reanimating their first corpse. Assuming the prior point does not apply to you, then reanimate any corpse and interact with a tanning rack while that reanimated thrall is still following you - doing this opens up a new recipe that allows you to craft a copy of the book for free. Craft the book, equip it and then click the "Update Mod" option to finalize the mod. I apologize if that method might be convoluted, but it's meant to continue the same idea of gatekeeping access to the book only to actual Necromancers. If you still did not get the grimoire with this method, then that first point did in fact apply to you so you will need to use [Backported Extended ESL Support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441).
  
* This is rare but sometimes the "Summon Grimoire" power might bug out and you will go into the reading animation without the menu showing up onscreen. If this happens to you just jump to break out of the animation or simply press the power again for the menu to show up.
At times reanimated thralls may go missing because of the respawn mechanic (they respawned back to their original location). Sometimes they may disappear as quest NPCs, because both the vanilla game and the Skyrim Unofficial Patch tend to delete NPCs from the game once their associated quest is over. I strongly recommend that you use the cloning features and native undead in this mod instead, especially as pack mules, because Created Undead will not respawn or get deleted from the game. For the vanilla game, if a thrall goes missing in either case then their reanimation effect could remain active in the Active Effects tab. If you would like to remove the reanimation effect then use the Catharsis spell or any other modded dispel spell to dispel it. Alternatively, you can use a few vanilla tricks to dispel rogue reanimation effects like getting arrested, transforming into a werewolf or a vampire lord or reading an elder scroll. However, if you would like to attempt to recover that missing thrall or the items that it had then click on the spoiler:
  
SpoilerIf you failed to promote a minion (cannot summon them) and lost them then reload an older save where you still have them, open console, click on them and take note of its Reference Form ID. Load up your latest save (where they're missing) open console again and type "prid xxxxxxxx" where xxxxxxxx is the Reference Form ID that you just recorded and then type "moveto player" to get them back if they're still alive.If that fails then they're dead.If you still care about recovering that corpse then type these commands in this order: "prid xxxxxxxx" "resurrect" "moveto player" and then "kill". Keep in mind that this will reset its inventory so you will lose everything that you gave them and they will likely spawn in hostile. Alternatively, you can type "player.moveto xxxxxxxx" to teleport to the corpse.If you only care about reclaiming their items then use these commands in this order: "prid xxxxxxxx" and "openactorcontainer 1".* There is an issue with the vanilla game where minions that are given armor to equip through this mod will wear it but will unequip them after being banished, summoned or after traveling through a loading screen. This happened because you removed all of the pieces of gear in their "default outfit" so the game forces them to re-equip all of the parts of that default outfit. There are two ways of dealing with this: the first being to re-equip the gear that you gave them but ensuring that you leave behind at least one of the pieces of their default outfit like their default boots for instance. The second and more reliable solution to this is to promote them, doing so will ensure that they automatically equip the best gear in their inventory - just like the vanilla followers do. Please remember that Created Undead comes with a feature that allows you to replace their default outfits altogether.
This tends to be rare, but at times you might encounter a bug where the Corpse Preparation menu doesn't appear for a corpse when sneaking. If this happens then simply reanimate the corpse with a reanimation spell and use the "Debug" option from the Follower menu to fix this. Alternately, you can reanimate the corpse and simply go through a loading screen with the reanimated thrall (by entering another cell like a house) to fix it.
  
* Sometimes creating "Clones," "Worm Thralls," "Spectral Thralls" and "Soul Snared" does not produce a perfect copy of the subject corpse. For example, creating a "Clone" through the Create Undead ritual from a dead troll might produce a wolf, a sabrecat or another predator in Skyrim or creating a "Clone" of a bandit produces another one with a different race or sex. The mod uses the same spawning mechanic as vanilla Skyrim so sometimes that minion will appear as another minion within that same leveled list. If you wish to create that original body then you will have to keep creating a clone of that clone until you get the one you prefer or you will have to get lucky on the roll. This is usually limited to generically named NPCs, so this does not affect unique NPCs that are named, so stick with those if this limitation bothers you.
Unfortunately, there are three engine limitations to the Possession spell. The first engine limitation is the camera, once the possession succeeds the camera tends to be zoomed in (making the Promoted Undead appear invisible) but this can be fixed by simply zooming out the camera to make the Promoted Undead visible. The second engine limitation prevents players from using the attack buttons for both spellcasters (humanoids with spells equipped) and non-humanoid undead (undead that are incapable of wielding weapons), however this limitation can be bypassed by simply moving the non-humanoid undead or spellcaster within melee range of an enemy target. Once within melee range, the undead will automatically attack and/or cast spells on the enemy without the player's actual input. The third engine limitation to possession tends to bug out the jumping animations for controlled humanoids (undead NPCs that are capable of jumping just like the player). However, this mod provides a built-in fix for this by setting the humanoid to "ragdoll" soon after jumping, which serves to preemptively fix that jumping animation bug, so please do not panic when this happens as it is intentional.
  

  
  
  
[font=Times New Roman]::RECOMMENDED MODS::[/font]
  
  
Please note that the following mods, for the most part, are not actually required for this mod to work:
  
  

  
* A Merged Patch created with [SSEEdit](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/164) is recommended to increase compatibility between mods in general. Even if you don't use this mod, it's always a good idea to create one. You can learn how to create a merged patch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5Tw3t2MvaU).
A Bashed Patch created with [Wrye Bash](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1840) could significantly reduce the likelihood of crashes with NPCs due to having several mods installed that change the leveled lists. Again, even if you don't use this mod, it's always a must to create a bashed patch for better stability when you have mods that edit leveled lists, just be sure to rebuild a bashed patch every time that you change your load order. You can learn how to create a bashed patch [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1Es06MtAZM).
  
* [Backported Extended ESL Support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441) - Essential for those who use Skyrim 1.5.97, Skyrim 1.6.659 or any version in between to ensure that this mod is recognized by the older versions of the game. This is redundant and unnecessary for those who use Skyrim 1.6.1130 and later versions.
[Custom Skills Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41780) - Highly recommended as it conveniently lets players pick perks from an actual perk tree instead of learning perks through the mod's chapter system. Use one of the Custom Skills Framework patches in Practical Necromancy's download section.
  
* [Custom Skills Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62423) or [Denji's Custom Skills Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/130095) - Conveniently tweaks the vanilla tab menu to make custom skill perk trees easier to access, so that you will no longer need the grimoire to open up the perk tree.
[Custom Skills Menu - Some Custom Icons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/158706) - Provides a different icon for the mod while in the Custom Skills Menu.
  
* [Spell Perk Item Distributor (SPID)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869) - Highly recommended as it will distribute the following perks to all Promoted Undead: LightFoot (immunity to traps), AlchemySkillBoosts (skill boosting potions will now work), PerkSkillBoosts (skill boosting enchantments will now work) and MDAAbUndeadPerk (fall damage immunity). The following spells will be distributed to Necromancers and a few of the named Necromancer bosses: Soul Assault, Soul Strike, Soul Burst and Soul Shred. Use the SPID patch in Practical Necromancy's download section.
[Keyword Item Distributor (KID)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55728) - Highly recommended as it will improve compatibility of all absorb spells with the Blood Seal perk and applies some miscellaneous fixes. Use the KID patch in Practical Necromancy's download section.
  
* [Better MessageBox Controls](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1428) - Highly recommended for better navigation through the new menus that are added by this mod.

* [Enderal Font for Skyrim SE (Dumbledor Font)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2004) - If you ever played Enderal like I did and could never go back to the default Skyrim font.
[I'm Walkin' Here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27742) - For those with so many minions that it's becoming increasingly difficult to navigate through them.
  
* [Enhanced Reanimation](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43500) - Allows the reanimation of decapitated NPCs, makes reanimated mounts rideable and allows reanimated Necromancers to cast reanimation spells.
[Undead Summons Emerge From The Ground](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33955) - Does exactly what it says on the tin.
  
* [Robes Retexture SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/110655) - For the cool Black Mage and Necromancer Robe retextures.

Please do not upload my mod to other websites. Anyone can make a translation for this mod and my other mods without seeking my permission. The only thing that I ask is that you at least upload the translation to the Nexus. For those out there who own a website, then it's perfectly fine if you host the translation on other websites, but all I ask is that you please maintain a separate mod page for the translation here on the Nexus in addition to that copy on your website.
