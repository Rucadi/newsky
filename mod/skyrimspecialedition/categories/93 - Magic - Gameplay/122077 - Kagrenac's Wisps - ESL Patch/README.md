***How to:***
  
Once you install mod, quest will be initiated, that will lead you to Ruins
  
of Rkund. There you will find book in the chest. Read it and you'll get
  
magic ability to craft unique dwarven wisps and fill them with light.
  
You can craft them on blacksmith anvil under misc category. You'll need
  
some resources like dwarven oil, gold ingot, flawless garnet and etc.
  
[size=1]For lazy persons: There is a cheat urn in Riverwood Sleeping Giant Inn.

  
  
  
**known issues:** 
  
  
If you are using multiple follower mods, beware to summon too many wisps
  
together, large amount of lighting may cause light flickering and even
  
desktop crash
  
  
Requirements: None
  
  
Compatibility: There shouldn't be any conflicts, unless with mods that use same armor slot (59). (tip: you can always change slot in [SSE edit](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/164/?))
