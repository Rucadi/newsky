Atronach Friendly Fire is a small, simple mod with a HUGE impact on gameplay - Hitting Atronachs with a spell or enchanted weapon that matches their element will now heal them instead of doing nothing. This simple premise will elevate your immersion to heights previously unknown. Plus, it's a really fun take on an Elementalist build!

  
**How to install and where to load?**
  
  

Atronach Friendly only requires SKSE64 to be installed, and load order does not matter. Install whenever - even in the middle of a running save. Uninstalling is NOT recommended, it might corrupt your save.
  
  
Additionally, if you have PO3's excellent [Spell Perk Item Distributor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869)﻿ installed, the FOMOD contains an option to disable the Cloak Spell in favor of an Ability. Recommended, but not required.
  
  
As of V3+, [Perk Entry Point Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/91192)﻿ is supported. If you have it installed, the mod automatically uses it to calculate your spell's actual magnitude - meaning that the limitation of only using the base magnitude is no more!

  
  
**What about mod-added Atronachs?**
  
  
As of version 2.0, all Atronachs that fall under the Fire, Frost, and Shock categories are supported out of the box, including modded ones, no patches required. In a future 2.1 update, this will be extended to other Atronachs, such as Poison and Sun Atronachs. For more technical information, if the Atronach has the ActorTypeDaedra keyword and has 100% or more resistance to an element, it will be healed when struck by that element.
