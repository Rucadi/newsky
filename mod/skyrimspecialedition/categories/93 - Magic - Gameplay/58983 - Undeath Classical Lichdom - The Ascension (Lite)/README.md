[font=Verdana]**Description**
  
  
I've always loved Undeath, and since I usually play female characters, Ascension's new lich variants really appealed to me. That said, I also love Classical Lichdom's gameplay enhancements, and didn't really want to choose between the two.  So I finally decided to not let my dreams be dreams, learn Papyrus, and make it happen. Several weeks of pain later, I bring you this mod!
  
  
This mod is **not** a port of all of Ascension's features/changes over to Classical Lichdom, hence the "Ascension Lite" moniker.  It ports the new lich armor/clothing variants, the dynamic outfit system, and the female lich models over from Ascension while keeping all of Classical Lichdom's systems intact.  I did, however, add a few new features and options not present in either mod, a full list of which is available below.
  
  
**Features**
  

  
* **More variety** **-** **new lich skins** for both skeletal and draugr-style liches, with color variations for each shroud type, including the new white shroud type added by Classical Lichdom.  In addition, all new lich variants can use the ethereal form added by Classical Lichdom. For Khajiit and Argonian liches, see [font=Verdana][size=3][font=Verdana][size=3][Undeath - Skeletal Liches for All Races](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/115890)[/font][/size][/font] as well.[/size]
**Female Liches** **-** All lich forms **now have a female variant**, including the Ayleid lich form added by The Cause (Requires Classical Lichdom's The Cause DLC addon).  
  
* **Dynamic Outfit System** **-** The form you take as a lich will **depend on the cuirass you have equipped**. Unique variants include wearing priest/mage robes to assume a dragon priest-style form, and wearing Miraak's robes to assume a form resembling his outfit. Full details are listed below. **Works completely fine with Classical Lichdom's new customization system**, and will keep the choices you make there intact. Speaking of which...
**Reworked Customization System** - Don't like the dynamic outfit system? Turn it off in the MCM, and you'll be able to **choose which armor variant you want explicitly at your phylactery**. If its disabled before becoming a lich, you'll be asked to pick your armor variant after successfully completing the The Path of Transcendence.  If you turn it off after becoming a lich, you'll be given the last armor variant you had equipped while transformed until changed at your phylactery (unless using a Dragon Priest or Ayleid form).  Also of note, you can now **pick a normal or skeletal dragon priest form when changing your appearance at your phylactery**, regardless of if you have the dynamic outfit system enabled, with all shroud color variations available. The Miraak robe variant is unlockable after completing At the Summit of Apocrypha. (Note: customization still requires 25 souls as normal to unlock)
  
* **Masks -** **All vanilla dragon priest masks are wearable in lich form**, including Miraak and Konahrik. The Konahrik's Accoutrements and Legacy of the Dragonborn patches also let you wear the masks added by those mods in lich form as well. See below for details regarding those patches. This mod does not contain the hoodless variants of the dragon priest masks originally added by Ascension at the moment.
**Vampire and Werewolf Options** - Toggleable features in the MCM that let you **keep your vampire and werewolf forms when becoming a lich**. These are off by default, but can be toggled on independently.  See the Recommended Mods section for links to hybrid mods.
  
* **Cleaned and Optimized** all meshes and textures using CAO.  BC7, Mipmaps, etc. Meshes now fully optimized using SSE NIF Optimizer.
**Optimized scripts**as best as I could, tried to reduce all laggy function calls to a minimum.
  

  
**Dynamic Outfit System - Details**As stated, the dynamic outfit system changes the form your lich assumes when transforming depending on the current cuirass (body slot 32) you have equipped. The current possible forms are as follows:
  

  
* [size=3]No outfit equipped -> Rags
  
Clothing or Non-"Priest" Robes -> Clothed
  
- Light Armor -> Light Armor
Heavy Armor -> Heavy Armor
  
- "Priest" Robes -> Dragon Priest
Miraak's Robes (any variant) -> Miraak
  
A full list of valid mage/priest robes for the dragon priest variant can be found by clicking the spoiler tag below.  With the Konahrik's Accoutrements patch, or the composite Legacy of the Dragonborn patch, all KA dragon priest robes are also added to this list, as are Miraak's to his.

[font=Verdana][font=Verdana][/font][/font]
  

[font=Verdana]Any mod not listed here that edits the meshes of the dragon priest variants of the masks will conflict with this mod. The effects of this could be benign and have no effect/minor clipping, cause things to be strangely textured, be off centered or oddly placed, or have them not show up at all or be duplicated. 
  
  
**Installation**This mod has a FOMOD installer with all patches included, just download and install with MO2 or Vortex.  Manual or NMM Installations are not supported at this time. Load this mod and its patches after Classical Lichdom. The new female Ayleid Lich variant requires The Cause CC and Undeath Classical Lichdom's patch for it.
  
  
This mod and all its patches are in the ESP-FE (light esp) format.
  
  
**Known Issues**
  
[/font]

  
* [font=Verdana]There is a small graphical issue on the male Skeletal Dragon Priest model where it has a piece of the original dragon priest foot mesh attached to the bottom of the foot.  This was an issue retained from the original Ascension mod.  [/font]

  
* [font=Verdana]There is possibly a gap on some male lich mesh's heads. Investigation ongoing.[/font]
[font=Verdana]Beast Races aren't formally supported. This is a holdover issue from the original Ascension. For Skeletal Liches, use [font=Verdana][size=3][Undeath - Skeletal Liches for All Races](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/115890)﻿[/font].[/size][/font]
  

[font=Verdana]
  
Update instructions for 1.2+ below for MCM issues (legacy, not needed with later versions):
  
Spoiler I reproduced the MCM issue on my end, and spent a few hours messing around with the script and the CK, and was able to get it working.  One issue I did run into was on saves running the broken script, it did not update and kept all the old values that needed to be fixed.  There are a handful of solutions to this issue:
  
1) Start a new game.
  
2) Load a save game before update 1.2 or Ascension was installed
  
3) Get [Resaver](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5031/) , open your most recent save. In the top left corner there will be a box to search/filter by script.  Type "NecroUCLAMCMScript" without quotes.  It will show a few folders. Expand the one that says "Script Instances" all the way.  When fully expanded, right click on the "NecroUCLAMCMScript" instance, and select "Delete (1 Element)".  Go to the file menu, Save As, and save it in your Skyrim Special Edition save folder, preferably with a new name, but it will keep backups of old saves.  If you did everything right, it should now load the MCM menu.
  
  
Sorry the solutions either cause you to lose progress or are a bit technical, but its a side effect of scripts getting baked in save files.  If after all that you still have issues with the MCM on 1.23, let me know.
  
  
Manual console commands for changing the MCM settings preserved just in case:
  
Toggle Outfit System: "set NecroLichOutfitChangeSystemActive to 0" , 1 to re-enable
  
Toggle Vampires: "set NecroLichAllowVampires to 1" , 0 for disable
  
Toggle Werewolves: "set NecroLichAllowWerewolves to 1" , 0 for disable  
  
  
**Permissions**Since this mod includes the work of multiple authors, permissions can get a bit murky. **Anything using assets from the original Undeath mod or Classical Lichdom should be fine**, given their open permissions.  Myst42 requires you to get permission from them to use their assets from Ascension, so please direct inquiries regarding **model/texture** use to them.  You are **free to use any of my edited scripts**, and I have provided (and commented!) the source code I used. You have **full permission to release patches or fixes** to this mod, **provided** that it does not redistribute Myst42's work without their permission, **and** you agree to take on full support for the changes you make. The two vanilla models I edited (the female Ayleid lich and hoodless dragon priest Konahrik mask) are free to use. **Translations of the mod are also fine** provided they obey the conditions above.
  
  
**Credits**This mod wouldn't be possible if not for the work of [Myst42](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/2125204?tab=user+files&BH=1), the original author of [Undeath - The Ascension](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/101390), who graciously gave me permission to port it. Go check out their work!  Shoutouts as well to [Misicks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/52908891) for their [full SE port of Ascension](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32960), and of course [ConnerRia](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/ConnerRia?gameId=1704) for [Classical Lichdom](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40802) and [Antioch08](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Antioch08?gameId=1704) for making [Undeath](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6180) in the first place.
  
  
Also, shoutouts to Beyond Skyrim's [Arcane University](https://wiki.beyondskyrim.org/wiki/Arcane_University:Scripting_Best_Practices) and [Subhuman0100](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/102834443?tab=user+files) for helping me figure out how to code in papyrus optimally.
