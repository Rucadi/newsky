# Torches are Magic

DESCRIPTION :
  
  
This mod adds new torches to your game. They act as traditional torches, in that you equip them to your left hand and carry them around, however a new animation is attached to them that will allow you to carry the flame in a magical manner. They come in 6 different styles, traditional fire orange, blue, green, purple, red and white. Each style has two different version, one that is vanilla brightness and radius, and one that is twice the brightness and radius.
  
  
For now these items are not craftable and you will need to add them to your game by other means. You can use the console by typing HELP "Magic Torch" 0, than using the additem command. Or, easier still, get yourself [Add Item Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17563)﻿ or [ModX](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/137877). I'm sorry they are not yet craftable, but as a Light Source they can not be crafted by normal means and a script must be written in order to get them craftable. 
  
  
  
  
REQUIRES :
  
  
Either [Dynamic Animation Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33746) OR [Open Animation Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92109)﻿. I made it in DAR as I just threw it together but it will work just fine with OAR.
  
  
Either [Add Item Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17563) or [ModX](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/137877)﻿ or any other way to add non craftable items to your game.
  
  
  
  
KNOWN ISSUES :
  
  
This mod is intended for 3rd person game play, and does not include animations for first person. It can still be used but it will look strange in first person.
