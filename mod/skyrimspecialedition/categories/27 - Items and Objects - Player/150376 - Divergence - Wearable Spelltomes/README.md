This mod adds craftable spell tomes that can be equipped to your waist on the back left or back right. These Wearable Spell Tomes will fortify your magicka and magicka regeneration. It also distributes it to the loot pool of magic using NPCS. They can also be found for sale at the College of Winterhold by the mages of the spell tome's respective school of magic, by the court wizard of every hold, as well as your general merchants. Enemy mages will have the chance to spawn with a spell tome equipped.

• Please note that this does NOT retexture the Spell Tomes themselves. It only creates the item that can be equipped.
  
  
• This does not directly edit NPCs but it does edit their merchant chests, outfit and loot list. So, if other mods edit these same lists, only the mod loaded the lowest will take effect. Regardless of where it is placed in your Load Order, the items will still be craftable and wearable.
