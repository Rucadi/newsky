**Skyrim's Unique Drinks**
  
  
Feel cheated about the Bee and Barb being the only place with specialty drinks even though alcohol seems to be THE central hobby for Nords everywhere? Well look no further! SUDs brings you a new signature alcoholic beverage for EVERY inn in Skyrim and Solsthiem and overhauls the Bee and Barb drinks all with unique models as well.
  
  
Undertake the quest "The Golden Mile" to obtain and guzzle down one of each drink in its Inn of origin to earn yourself the "Drunken Boxing" power which after drinking at least 3 signature drinks, will drastically boost your unarmed damage and stamina regeneration for a minute, scaled with the number of drinks you consume in that period (max 10 drinks). The quest begins by drinking any one of the signature beverages inside the Inn it's from.
  
  
**Installation**
  
-Download manually or with your mod manager
  
-Activate the mod on the left panel and activate the plugin on the right panel (MO2) or Install in Vortex and deploy the mod.
  
-Update your Bash patch or carry forward any changes made to vanilla assets into your custom conflict resolution patch.
  
Important: [color=#ffffff]You will need to ensure that ALL mods in your load order which edit Inn Merchant containers are properly bash tagged with "Invent.Add" or your custom conflict resolution patch has the record changes carried forward, in order to make sure that all mods have their items included. If one of those mods doesn't and is loaded after those that are, it will override all other additions and items will be missing.[/color]
  
  
This mod is an ESL flagged ESP plugin and DOES NOT take up a slot in your load order.
  
  
Disclaimer: It is never a very smart idea to add or remove mods on a save in progress; it's always advisable to start fresh when you want to change your load order. That said, this is a fairly simple mod and doesn't make any changes to scripts or persistent records so it might be ok to add to the end of your load order and be ok... MIGHT.
  
  
**Uninstall**
  
-Do the install stuff but in reverse
  
  
**Incompatibilities**
  
Any mods that alter the custom drinks in Riften could need a patch. Any mod that edits Inn merchant containers may interfere but a properly made bash patch or conflict resolution patch should avert any issues.
  
  
**Patch Policy**
  
I would appreciate 3rd party patches made by others if they are necessary for compatibility with other mods, but I would prefer to host them here so they are centralized and people don't have to go hunting for patches. If you want to make a patch and get in touch with me I'd appreciate being able to post it and will credit you for providing it. Thanks!
