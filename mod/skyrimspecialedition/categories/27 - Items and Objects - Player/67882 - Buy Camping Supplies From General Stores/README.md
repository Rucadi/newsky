**About:**A quick SSEedit mod, allows you to buy camping supplies in the general stores. Because, for some reason, you don't want to chop firewood yourself (you have the coin and you can pay someone to do the mundane task).
  
  
**Affected stores:**
  

  
* Riverwood - Riverwood Trader
Whiterun - Belethor
  
* Winterhold - Birna's Oddments
Markarth - Arnleif and Sons Trading Company
  
* Riften - Pawned Prawn
Windhelm - Sadri's Used Wares
  
* Falkreath - Gray Pine Goods
Solitude - Bits and Pieces
  

  
**Compatibility Note:**
  
This mod directly edits the mentioned vendors. A patch is needed if another mod overwrites them. I don't use any of the mods that affect them so I'm unaware of any incompatibility.
