Skyrim has plenty of amazing bard mods, however a majority of them only use the vanilla instruments. I was never able to find a mod that added new playable instruments to my liking, so I decided to give a try at making one myself. 
  
  
The Dragon Bard adds 4 different violins and 2 bows to the game, which can be crafted at a forge or added via console commands/AddItem Menu mod. After equipping them (technically they are armor pieces) you can choose from a short list of songs to play. The Violin Song Menu lesser power can be obtained from its respective spellbook, which is craftable at a forge.
  
  
When a song is selected from the menu, the character should start playing the instrument (assuming it's equipped). The animation and music will play regardless of the violin/bow being equipped or not, but it'll look pretty goofy without them. You can reactivate the song menu to cancel the music at any point, however the animations will not stop until the character jumps or takes out their weapon. I am still working on a fix for this.
  
  
The violins come in 2 basic variants and 2 unique variants:
  
  
  
Violin - This is the basic instrument you need the craft the other variants. Can be crafted with firewood and steel ingots.
  
  
Ebony - A dark grey/black version of the basic violin. Can be crafted with the original violin and an ebony ingot.
  
  
Dragon: Adds glowing blue designs to the basic violin model, including actual runes in the dragon language! (I designed the glowmaps, the runes actually translate to words). Can be crafted with the original violin and a dragon bone.
  
  
Daedric: Adds glowing red symbols to the Ebony model, for a more dark/evil style. Can be crafted with the Ebony violin and a daedra heart.
  
  
  
There are 2 bow variants - one that matches the basic/dragon variants, and another that matches the ebony/daedric. They can be crafted with firewood at a forge.
