• Oghma Guardian:Offering your mind as a vessel, you summon the Guardian of Infinite Wisdom to follow you. It is equivalent to a follower, but it cannot be attacked and cannot be seen by the enemy. It can use the spell tome you give it and learn the contents in it to use it in combat. As the level increases, its magicka will increase, and using it again will dispel it. Cooldown time <20> seconds.
  
  
(Put a spell tome into its inventory, and it will learn the spells in that spell tome, and it will not destroy the spell tome. If you want it to forget the spell, just take the spell book out immediately. Don't give it a spell tome that can be used on itself, because it is a ghost and cannot benefit from any spell effects or debuffs, which will cause problems (such as the fire cloak).)

• Oghma Space: Enter a small Oghma space inside the Oghma Infinium, which has a large number of facilities for use and rest. It is impossible to enter the Oghma space during combat, and it is impossible to enter and exit the Oghma space frequently. The cooldown <24> hours.(In-game hours, not real-world hours, Read the Apocrypha Book on the table inside the space to leave the space.)

• Incomprehensible Knowledge : Summons a vortex of forbidden knowledge from the Book of Infinite Wisdom to surround you. All targets within <20> yards of you will have their heads permeated with forbidden and incomprehensible knowledge, dealing <30> health and mana damage per second, and with a chance of losing brain function, making them unable to move or fight for <15> seconds. The vortex of forbidden knowledge lasts for <60> seconds. Cooldown <180> seconds.
  
  
  
(The cooldown effect of all skills is universal. If the cooldown effect of a skill has not ended, all skills cannot be used, The skill cooldowns of paths are independent of each other and will not be affected by Book's cooldown.)
