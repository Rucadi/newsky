**What is Essential Supplies?**
  
Tired of going to an alchemist vendor, only to find out that there are absolutely no health, magicka or stamina potions? Ever wanted to buy some pelts for your crafting needs and went to the Drunken Huntsman, only to find out, that the Huntsman doesn't offer any Pelts?
  
Essential Supplies allows you to spend your hard earned gold for the items you need! No matter if its potions or other essential items that are required for your journey or other activities! 
  
  
  
**Gold is there to be spent!**
  
Specially when you are using a mod like [SkyValor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106240), you want jump into action. Stock up on potions and dive directly back into combat instead of spending hours collecting flowers and crafting potions.
  
  
  
**Not all vendors will have the same stock available as others. Also the amount will vary from vendor to vendor. Major cities vendor have in general more potions in stock, than smaller cities. Some cities have potions that others don't have.**
