Waterskin is a standalone implementation of the good old iNeed's waterskin from Isoku, with its own bells and whistles. Intended for use with CC Survival Mode, or any need mod built on top of it.
  
Stay Hydrated In Tamriel by drinking fresh water and enhance bonuses from the food you eat.
  
  
**Core Features**
  

  
* **Craft waterskins** at any Tanning Rack for 1 Leather and 1 Leather Strip.
**Fill your waterskin** by using it from the inventory, while standing in water. This will play a short animation.
  
* **Drink from your waterskin** to restore a **very small amount of hunger** if using Survival Mode.
Waterskins may only restore hunger **once every 6 in-game hours**. No point in refilling and emptying your waterskins 10 times.
  
* Drinking from your waterskin gives the **Hydrated** bonus for **12 minutes**.
While properly hydrated, **the effectiveness of all food buffs is increased by 20%**.
  
* **Vampires cannot get the Hydrated bonus**. They're already managing their own kind of thirst.
Waterskins are relatively cheap to prevent an exploit with crafting, given the low material cost.
  

  
  
**Optional Features**
  

  
* If you're using [IED](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62001), a preset is available as optional download to **display your waterskin at your left hip**.
If you're using [Gourmet](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/96876) ﻿(warmly recommended), a patch is provided in order to ensure the Hydrated status works as expected.
  
* An optional download gives a 5% chance for your waterskin to degrade and be removed from inventory when consuming it.

  
  
**Bonus Features**
  

  
* If [CID](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99486) ﻿is installed, empty waterskins will be **available for sales at most general good merchants**. (Strongly Recommended)
If [FLM](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74037) ﻿is installed, vendors accepting to buy waterskins will be overall more consistent, such as Hunters.
  
* If [SPID](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869) ﻿is installed, you may occasionally **find filled waterskins on some other NPCs**, and **empty ones on sales from hunters**.
If [ASS](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89823) ﻿and all of its requirements are installed, **waterskins will have a custom icon** in your inventory. *\**
  
* If [Description Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/105799)﻿ is installed, the empty waterskin will have a **flavor text telling you how to use it**.

  
*\* This currently only work for the potion version. ASS do not currently recognize its waterskin keyword for misc items.*

**Best critics of the mods so far**
  

  
* "*Huh, you're modding Skyrim again ? You said you stopped.*" - Girlfriend.

**Requirements**
  
[SKSE](https://skse.silverlock.org/)
  
[powerofthree's Papyrus Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22854)
  
CC Survival mode (Survival mode do not need to be enabled, but the plugin has to be in your load order)
  
[BEES](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441) if you downgraded to an older Skyrim version
  
  
  
**Soft Requirements**
  
The relevant frameworks listed above if you want to benefit from the "bonus features" listed earlier. But If crafting your own waterskin, drinking/filling it, and getting the hydrated buff is enough for you, there is no need to get them.

**Permissions**
  
This was only possible thanks to [Isoku](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/2463371) fully opening permissions for [iNeed](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/645). So it make absolute sense to keep this completely open too.
