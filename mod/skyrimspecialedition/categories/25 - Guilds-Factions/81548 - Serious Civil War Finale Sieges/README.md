Fully voiced restoration of the final Civil War Siege battles outside the cities of Solitude and Windhelm, including barricades to break through and exterior gates to open, before taking the fight into the city.
  
  
Features
  
  

  
* Blocked off some public areas of Solitude that do not need to be accessible during the siege, such as the shortcut to Castle Dour along the city walls, the Temple of the Divines courtyard, and the Blue Palace.
In Solitude, some rubble from a nearby building has fallen into the road, so the route to Castle Dour might be a bit longer than before...
  
* In Solitude, you'll now need to enter Castle Dour through the upstairs door (because otherwise Stage 5 of the siege never triggers).
In Windhelm, you can no longer bypass the battle in the marketplace by going straight through the graveyard near the Hall of the Dead.
  
* In Windhelm, Brunwulf Free-Winter will be present for the victory speech, since Rikke had sent men to "protect him and bring him here". He now has a line of dialogue during the speech too!
A few tweaks to the progress of objectives and stages for all Civil War Siege quests for consistency (shared across my Civil War mods).
  

  
  
Compatibility
  
  
This mod edits **CWFinaleScript**, **CWSiegeScript**, **CWReinforcementControllerScript**and the Quest Fragments of **CWFinale** and **CWSiege**, and will not be compatible with anything else that edits those scripts. Check for *loose file overwrite* conflicts.
  

  
* **Compatible** with [Open Civil War](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11076).
**Untested** with city overhauls﻿, but *probably compatible* with anything that doesn't significantly edit the core layout of streets and buildings in Solitude or Windhelm.
  

  
Compatible by design with the rest of my ***Serious Civil War***series:
