# Immersive Aggressive Opponents - Armor-Based Opposite Faction Aggression
- Author: lilebonymace
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70236


**Description**
  
  
If Imperial/Thalmor and Stormcloak NPCs meet, they will start fighting. However, in vanilla the only thing that changes when you join one of the factions is that soldiers [size=2]at military camps of the opposite faction will warn you when you approach them (calling you a citizen), and attack if you don't obey. Not immersive.

* This mod makes NPCs of these factions, including guards in holds controlled by their faction, attack the player if the player wears armor of the opposite side.
[size=2]If you wear a Stormcloak armor, Imperials, Thalmor, Penitus Oculatus and guards in holds controlled by the Empire will attack you on sight. If you wear an Imperial, Thalmor or Penitus Oculatus armor, Stormcloaks and guards in holds controlled by them will attack you on sight.[/size]
  
* Actually being in the faction is not required, they will attack you anyway if you wear the armor.
[size=2]It checks armor in the following slots (1 item is enough) in the following priority: Body > Head > Circlet > Hands > Feet. There is also an installer option to only check the Body slot (the cuirass).[/size]
  
* If you aggro some NPCs and switch your armor, it won't stop combat. But if you go far enough from them to stop combat and return, they won't attack you.
This behavior is disabled during Civil War quests that require you to visit the other faction headquarters: Message To Whiterun on the Imperial side and Season Unending.
  
* You can still visit any settlements you want at any time, but not in your faction armor.

**Requirements**
  
  

  
* [powerofthree's Papyrus Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22854)﻿
[Keyword Item Distributor (KID)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55728)﻿
  
* [size=2][Neutral Whiterun Guards](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70197?tab=description)﻿[/size]
[Equip Enchantment Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42839)﻿ with **ScriptEquipEventFix=true** is highly recommended, otherwise this mod may not trigger when the armor is equipped by some script (such as an alternate start mod, an auto equipping mod or any mechanic that restores your outfit), though it can be fixed by re-equipping, equipping or unequipping anything.
  

**Compatibility**
  
  

  
* This mod doesn't edit any vanilla records and therefore has no direct conflicts with other mods. Load order doesn't matter.
Any armors and clothes that have "ArmorMaterialImperial", "Thalmor", "Penitus" or "Stormcloak" in their name, EditorID or keywords are automatically supported, which means most if not all armors you would expect it to work with. If some armor is not recognized, you can add the corresponding keyword from this mod to it using KID. Don't forget that it only checks some specific body slots, so your imperial panties from some mod won't be recognized even if you add the keyword.
  
* To exclude some armor, add ImmersiveAggressiveOpponents\_ExcludedArmor [KYWD:FExxxDB2] keyword to it via KID.
Mod-added NPCs are affected if they use vanilla factions.
