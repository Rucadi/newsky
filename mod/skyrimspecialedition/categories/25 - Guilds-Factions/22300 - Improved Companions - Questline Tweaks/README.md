Description
  
  
Changes to the Companions:
  
  
Intro (C00)
  

  
* The giant attack outside Whiterun lasts longer, allowing you to join the fight.
Ria will not freak out if she happens to be present during the Jorrvaskr fight.
  
* Vilkas is prevented from using combat alerts and taunts when training you.

Proving Honor (C01)
  

  
* Aela can be your observer (Shield-Sibling) if she is determined to be your favorite quest giver.
The option to tell your observer to meet you at Dustman's Cairn will appear below the other dialogue options.
  
* Fixed a script error that allowed your observer to do favors after reverting from werewolf form.

The Silver Hand (C03)
  

  
* Fixed Skjor's dialogue where he thinks it's daytime during the night.
Edited Skjor's schedule so he won't wait for you until 8pm.
  
* Edited Aela's schedule so she won't go to the Underforge until 6pm.
If you indicate to Skjor that you might not want to be a werewolf, dialogue will end.
  
* If you leave the Underforge without accepting the transformation, Skjor and Aela will go back to their lives during the day and come back during the night.
If you return to the Underforge and speak to Skjor again, there is new dialogue to tell him whether you are prepared or not.
