**VERSION 1.1.4**
  
(09/05/2022)
  
  
> The Morag Tong, according to most scholars, had been a facet of the culture of Morrowind almost since its beginning. After all, the history of Resdayn, the ancient name of Morrowind, is rife with assassination, blood sacrifice, and religious zealotry, hallmarks of the order.

Head to Solstheim and you will be able to find a **Morag Tong Hideout**. As they are not really appreciated by House Redoran, they settled in the North-East of the island, ready to start assassinating again. Their leader, **Vanilath**, has heard of the return of the **Dark Brotherhood** on Solstheim and will not let it happen. Help them take down the Dark Brotherhood before it starts wreaking havoc in Raven Rock.
  
  
Chapter 1's ESL-flagged ESP contains 14 quests and 3 generic followers. Chapter 2's ESL-flagged ESP contains 9 quests.
  
  
What's new in Chapter 2? **Knower Caskan**has been sent by Master Nisik to help you figure out what your next move should be, and you will need it, because your enemies are out to get you. With **5 new main quests and 4 new writs**, you will be able to secure your position in the Morag Tong.
  
  

* Fight against the **Camonna Tong**, the **Werebears** and even other assassins from the **Morag Tong**.
**Recruit new assassins by asking followers to join your adventure**.
  
* Obtain new weapons inspired by The Elder Scrolls: Blades and The Elder Scrolls: Online.

* Can I join the Morag Tong if I am part of the Dark Brotherhood?

Yes, it is possible since version 1.1.4.
  
  

* How do I start the mod?

Head to the Morag Tong Hideout and talk to Vanilath. One of his dialogs will lead you to get recruited.
  
  

* Is this mod voiced?

Yes, it is!
  
  

* Are there any recruitable followers in this mod?

Three Morag Tong members will gladly join your adventures, as long as you were accepted as part of the Morag Tong (and received your armor).
  
  

* Can I save the slaves inside the Camonna Tong Hideout?

Yes, you can, just go to them and tell them to flee.
  
  

  
* Who can I recruit in the Morag Tong?

To recruit followers into the Morag Tong, just wait for the Main Quest to ask you to do so. Once the recruiting quest is active, head to your favourite follower and talk to them: a new dialogue option should be appearing. If you ask them to join the Morag Tong, they will wear a Morag Tong outfit and start living in the Fishing Settlement on Solstheim. Be careful,followers that are part of the Dark Brotherhood, the Blades, the College of Winterhold or the Morag Tong cannot join the Morag Tong, as they are already part of a bigger organization.
  
If you don't want to have your followers join the Morag Tong, just talk to Caskan and ask him to do the recruitment instead. He will recruit two generic Morag Tong assassins for you. However you'll have to choose: **it's either two followers or two generic assassins**, a mix of both is not an option.
  
  

  
* Do you suggest the use of any other mod with yours?
