**Listen - Dark Brotherhood Radiant Quests**
  
  
The Dark Brotherhood questline was fun, but you never really feel like the Listener. Apart from once during the storyline, and the Dark Brotherhood forever quest, the Night Mother never gives you contracts. This mod aims to fix that, to give meaning to the title of Listener, to fill out the Dark Brotherhood questline, and kill targets all around Skyrim.

After The Silence has been broken has been completed, speak with the Night Mother. Children pray and their Mother will answer. Up to five contracts are given every time you talk to the Night Mother. These are all for vanilla NPC's. NPC's in cities, towns, farms, and dungeons, in all nine holds. As of now there are sixty targets available, which is actually only about 5% of named NPC's. All have a reason for someone to want them dead, and a schedule that lets you reasonably kill them. Some cut Dark Brotherhood targets have been sent to the chopping block as well. Payment has been left in Dead Drops outside of the major cities. 
  
  
If you don't want to do the contracts yourself, no problem. You are the listener. Just assign the job to another Dark Brotherhood member. They will collect the payment for themselves of course. The Dark Brotherhood Forever side quest has been disabled. All dialogue is fully voiced using vanilla lines.
  
  
An MCM menu allows you to customize the payment, and number of contracts. By default, you receive 500 gold per contract, plus or minus 100. This can be altered at will. The base chance for any of the five quests being triggered by approaching the Night Mother is 75%, meaning you should receive three to five each time. This can be altered as well.
  
  
The mod is designed to allow patches to add or remove targets as you see fit. Add mod added NPC's as targets or remove NPC's required by other mods. No complicated scripting involved, anyone who can open SSEEdit can do it. There are five form ID lists, one for each dead drop. Just add the NPC to the list and they will be a target.
  
  
This should be compatible with almost all mods, including Dark Brotherhood mods like my At Your Own Pace - Dark Brotherhood.
  
  
Let me know if you have any targets or features you would like added. Especially let me know if any quests break from killing the NPC's early. None of the targets are essential, or even protected, but I don't think Bethesda really intended anyone to kill this many NPC's.
