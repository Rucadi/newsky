**Description**
  
  
This mod adds new Dark Brotherhood contracts for the following NPCs:
  
  

  
* [Nazeem](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Nazeem)﻿
[Braith](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Braith)﻿
  
* [Taarie](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Taarie) ﻿and [Endarie](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Endarie)﻿ (if they are killed, [Gisli](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Gisli) ﻿will take over the Radiant Raiment shop.)
[Rolff Stone-Fist](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Rolff_Stone-Fist)﻿
  
* [Lemkil](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Lemkil)﻿
[Thonar Silver-Blood](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Thonar_Silver-Blood)﻿ (Contract will be available after [No One Escapes Cidhna Mine](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:No_One_Escapes_Cidhna_Mine)﻿ and killed [Madanach](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Madanach)﻿.)
  
* [Elenwen](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Elenwen)﻿ (Contract will be available after [Dragonslayer](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dragonslayer)﻿.)
[Serana](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Serana) (Contract will be available after [Kindred Judgement](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Kindred_Judgment).)
  
* [Erikur](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Erikur)﻿ (Contract will be available after [The Dainty Sload](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Dainty_Sload)﻿ and [Diplomatic Immunity](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Diplomatic_Immunity)﻿.)

  
You can get these contracts from a contract boards in the dining rooms of the Falkreath or Dawnstar Sanctuaries. You can take the contracts and read them to start the quests.
  
  
Just like with the Vanilla contracts, you'll get 3 new dialogue options when you talk to your contracts, after the quest has been accepted. (except for Elenwen since she's aggressive when you enter the Embassy)
  
  
If you press "Yes" to accept the contract, the victim should no longer be essential.
  
  
**Requirements**
  
  
To kill Braith, you'll need a mod that makes it possible to kill children. I'd recommend [Slayable Offspring SKSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46826), but there are others as well.
  
  
**FAQ**
  
  
Q: What if I don't want to do a particular contract?
  
A: They are all optional and not at all needed to progress, so feel free to ignore the ones you don't want to do. They're just some ways to make a bit more gold, if you like killing. (or like some drama for your RP.)
  
  
Q: All doors at the Embassy have high level locks. Can you make them simpler?
  
A: There's actually another way.
  
SpoilerIn the Thalmor barracks at the Embassy, upstairs on a wooden table, you can find a masterkey. Of course this means getting past all of the Thalmor Soldiers and Wizards inside the barracks. If you have the [Wax Key](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Lockpicking) perk, you'll also get the key when you pick the first door, making all doors afterwards easier to open.
  
  
  
Q: Will you make a version that does <insert idea>?
  
A: I have no plans to make any changes for the time being. Feel free to make your own edits though. (see permissions) Please do not ask about this or PM me about it. Thank you.
  
  
Q: If I kill both sisters in Radiant Raiment, will their shop will no longer be available?
  
A: ~~A~~fter they are killed, [Gisli](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Gisli) ﻿will take over the Radiant Raiment shop.
  
  
Q: Will you include a contract for <insert NPC>?
  
A: Depends. If I like the suggestion and I have enough time, I might consider it.
  
  
Q: ESPFE?
  
A: Yes.
  
  
Q: Does installing/updating/uninstalling on an existing save work?
  
A: As far as I know, it should. However, it's good practice to keep a backup save prior to doing this, just in case.
  
  
Q: Is this compatible with <insert mod>?
  
A: I don't know by heart. You might need to check yourself.
  
  
Q: Will you make a patch for <insert mod>?
  
A: Only if it's a mod I use myself or plan on using, I have enough time and I actually like the idea. Otherwise, feel free to do it yourself. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: I have a suggestion to improve the mod. Can you do it?
  
A: Maybe, if I have time and I like the idea, I'll consider it.
  
  
Q: Will you port this to <insert platform>?
  
A: No, I myself only support the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If someone else wants to port it, feel free. (see permission) If you decide to port it, you yourself take full responsibility to offer support to said port. I will not provide no support for any ports by third parties.
  
  
Q: I use a ported version of this mod on <insert platform> and I have a problem. Can you help?
  
A: I don't provide any support for third party ports on other platforms than the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If you have issues, you should adress the person that ported it.
  
  
Q: Does this work on Skyrim 1.6+, aka "Anniversary Edition"?
  
A: Yes, it should.
  
  
Q: Why don't your mods use MCMs and instead use this janky console command system to set globals?
  
A: I am not a fan of MCMs. You can set the globals by making a patch in xEdit. I have no plans of changing this. If you want to add an MCM, feel free. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: Why don't you use FOMODs?
  
A: That would require reuploading the entire mod, in question, even if I only make a small change. My internet is limited and reuploading the files each time will take a huge chunk of my monthly volume.
