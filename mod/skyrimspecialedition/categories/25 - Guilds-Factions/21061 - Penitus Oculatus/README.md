**Description**
  
After you complete the quest "[Destroy the Dark Brotherhood!](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Destroy_the_Dark_Brotherhood!)", you can join the [Penitus Oculatus](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Penitus_Oculatus) by speaking to [Commander Maro](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Commander_Maro).
  
As a Penitus Oculatus agent, you can complete the following radiant quests from Commander Maro:
  

  
* Steal documents from the Thalmor
Assassinate troublesome Thalmor agents
  
* Kill rogue Penitus Oculatus agents
Assassinate Thalmor collaborators
  
* Kill remnant Dark Brotherhood assassins

After completing a few of these quests, you'll be given a quest line to eliminate the rest of the Dark Brotherhood:

  
* Kill [Babette](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Babette).
Kill [Cicero](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Cicero).
  
* Gain access to the [Dawnstar Sanctuary](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dawnstar_Sanctuary) and clear out the remaining members.
Kill [Amaund Motierre](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Amaund_Motierre) and [Rexus](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Rexus).
  

In the process, you'll be able to obtain unique items from the Dark Brotherhood quest line:

Obtain an optional [follower](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dark_Brotherhood_Initiate).
  
* Free [torture victims](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Torture_Victim) and be rewarded.

**A Note About A Skyrim Engine Bug**
  

  
* Reloading earlier saves without restarting SkyrimSE.exe is problematic because the game world doesn't completely reset.
[Here is a detailed video demonstrating an example of this bug](https://youtu.be/PJPzMAXSprU)﻿.
  
* If you encounter issues with this mod's quest or other quests, it might be due to this issue.

**Upgrading**
  

  
* If you are upgrading to versions 0.13.0 or higher from any lower version, please make sure don't have "A Nest of Vipers" quest active. I have moved the locations of artifacts, and upgrading during this quest might lock you out of these rewards.
If you are upgrading to versions 0.10.0 or higher from any lower version, please make sure you do not have any Penitus Oculatus quest active other than "Penitus Oculatus." Upgrade the mod after you have cleared these quests from your quest log.
  
* After upgrading, clean deleted scripts with [FallrimTools](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5031).
**Don't use outdated translations.**
  

**Voices**
  

  
* Voices generated with [ElevenLabs.io](https://beta.elevenlabs.io)﻿ beta

**Other important considerations**
  

  
* 0 ITMs
Minimal cell and worldspace edits
  
* No navmesh errors such as broken edge links that can cause crashes.
