This is a conversion of the original mod created by ThirteenOranges which can be found [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=119305443).
  
I've converted and uploaded this mod [with his permission](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cz2ufXPpioFMfCyfqAVXg6MrOBtJvuHp/view?usp=sharing).
  
Also included is the [**Travels Add-On**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=125029519). It was a seperate mod on Steam, but I've add it as an optional file in the download section.
  
  
**I'm releasing this as is**. I will not be updating this mod in any way so I won't be fixing any potential issues or mod conflicts you might find.
  
If you set out to patch any conflicts you find I won't stop you.
  
I'm just here to provide the conversion of the mod.
  
**In the coming weeks/months I'll try to convert every mod by ThirteenOranges, so keep an eye out.**
  
  
The description below is copied from ThirteenOranges original mod pages, with some adjustements of my own where needed.
  
  
  
====================
  
  
  
Pit Fighter contains an all new faction to join, complete with NPCs, progression through the ranks, unique rewards and side quests.
  
  
*"The Pit Fighters of Windhelm were once the city's proud Arena Team, known
  
throughout Tamriel as The Paladins. Since the Arena in Windhelm was
  
closed, the team has fallen on hard times, competing in underground pit
  
fights to earn coin and renown as the great champions of the Arena they
  
once were. Join their ranks, compete in Pit Fighting Arenas throughout
  
Tamriel and challenge current Champions to earn the ultimate title,
  
becoming a Legend of gladiatorial combat."*

**Great questions and amazing answers**
  
- **Is this mod compatible with mod X?**
  
This mod should be pretty compatible with most other mods, except those that make big changes to Windhelm. Even then, I'd advice you to try it out for yourself. The only thing that would cause real conflict is mods that add clutter where the Pit Fighter entrance would be.
  
  
-- **JK's Windhelm -** I can confirm there are some clipping issues, but nothing that would prevent you from using both mods.
  
-- **Open Cities** - A patch for Open Cities is available right [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25082?tab=files)﻿ !
  
  
- **Will you make a patch for mod X?**No, sorry.
  
  
**- Where is the entrance to the Pit Fighters?**
  
It's in the Windhelm Dark Elf district, on the corner next to Sadri's Used Wares. If you don't see the door you might have another mod loaded that makes adjustments to Windhelm and blocks the entrance.
  
  
**- Why are there 2 .esps?**
  
The original mod was seperated in the base mod and the add-on that relied on DLC content, so that people who didn't own the DLC could still play the base version of the mod. I don't understand enough of how both .esps work together and don't feel confident enough to merge them. So, I provide the mod as it is: in 2 parts.
