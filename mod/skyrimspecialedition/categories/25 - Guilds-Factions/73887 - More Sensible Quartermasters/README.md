# More Sensible Quartermasters

**Description**
  
This mod is an attempt to make the quartermasters at military camps more sensible. In vanilla they're just generic blacksmiths that sell random blacksmith stuff not related to their faction, the items lying around are just steel and iron. What are all these items for? For selling them to adventurers? Aren't quartermasters supposed to handle the gear for the soldiers?
  
  
With this mod:
  

  
* Quartermasters sell items of their faction instead of the generic blacksmith stuff
Quartermasters only trade with you if you're in their faction (and ﻿otherwise just say the soldier hello lines like any other soldiers)
  
* The items lying around are replaced with ones that match their faction, using [Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805)﻿

**Requirements**
  

  
* [Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805)﻿ (only required for replacing the items lying around)

**Compatibility**
  

  
* For the stock replacement this mod edits the vendor containers and the NPC records of quartermasters. These edits may conflict with some other mods.
In case you have another preferred mod that edits the quartermasters stock, a Lite version is provided. It only includes the Base Object Swapper config and the requirement of being in the faction to trade with quartermasters.
  
* For the requirement of being in the faction [size=2]to trade with quartermasters this mod edits their vendor factions. I don't think there are many mods that edit those records.[/size]
The worldspace edits are done via Base Object Swapper and therefore don't conflict with anything. They should apply to mod-added camps as well, if they're configured properly.
  
* There weren't vanilla leveled lists for everything, so if you want quartermasters to sell mod-added items, you may need to additionally integrate them into this mod.
Compatible with [WACCF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18994)﻿ and [Trade and Barter](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23081)﻿
