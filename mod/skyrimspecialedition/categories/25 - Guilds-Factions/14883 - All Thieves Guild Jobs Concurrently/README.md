This is an official port of [All Thieves Guild Jobs Concurrently](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52721) by [jakj](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3111339) to Skyrim Special Edition.
  
Please endorse the original mod as well. Skyrim by default artifically limits you to one job for
  
Delvin and one job for Vex at a time, but the underlying quest structure supports all seven at a time,
  
so this mod simply removes the "is player on job for X" check from the dialogue of Delvin and Vex.
  
  
The mod lets you start one of each type of job at a time (bedlam, fishing, numbers, burglary, shill, sweep, and heist)
  
but not more than one of the same type. The point of this is to get to the 125 jobs completed faster
  
but without any sort of cheating, requiring a minimum of 18 trips out into the world rather than the
  
staggeringly-obnoxious 63 that the base Skyrim requires.
  
  
If you are already on one of each of Vex's four jobs or Delvin's three jobs, and you try to ask for more work,
  
the conversation will simply end with no ill effect (since it's harmless, and this way I can avoid editing
  
any scripts which would cause problems with existing savegames).
  
  

  
* Take on all 7 types of Thieves Guild jobs at once.

* This mod will conflict with any mod that alters the way Thieves Guild special jobs work.
This mod edits only the dialogue (no scripts, characters, or anything else), so there's no reason you can't enable and disable this mod at will without hurting your saved games.
