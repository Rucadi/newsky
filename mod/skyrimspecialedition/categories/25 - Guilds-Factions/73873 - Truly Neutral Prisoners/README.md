After 10 years, this is the issue that brought me back to CK.

  
  
  
Ever wanted to hunt down all those dirty Thalmor agents but couldn't get on with it because of the constant harassment by the authorities?
  
  
Ever had severe seizures and depression after your immersion got ruined because you stalked those guards out to the middle of nowhere, just to get SNITCHED on by the PRISONER!?
  
  
Well, no more I say!
  
  
  
  

**What does it do?**

  
  
Does what it says, Joe, right there on the corn pops - forgot your glasses?
  
  
  
Finally solves the issues of prisoners from the vanilla Thalmor and Imperial prisoner transport events telling everyone and their mother about how you murdered those sons of b... well, you get my point.
  
The fix is not entirely perfect, as you might have guessed. Can't fix Skyrim being Skyrim. But now at least you don't have to kill the prisoner anymore when you decide to ambush his guards - as long as there are no other witnesses, your bounty should get cleared.
  
  
I highly recommend to install this with [NARC](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17946)﻿ to stop the animals from telling on you, too.
  
  

**Compatibility**

  
The mod comes cleaned courtesy of SSEEdit 4.0.4 and has been tested in my load order of over 400 plugins including iCitizens and Immersive World Encounters. There *should* be no issues, but I do not use any faction war mods as I have had bad experiences with those in the early days of modded Skyrim and have never looked back on those again.
  
  
If you need and want to make a patch, you are welcome to, although I really don't expect that to be necessary.
  
  
Requires [USSEP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266).
  
Made on and for AE-light (SE-AE update 1.6+). Probably runs on SE, no guarantees though and ~~you have to remove the USSEP master requirement~~ nope you don't! Uploaded a new optional version complete w/o USSEP requirement. No warranty on that tho and no maintenance either.
  
  
  

TECHNICAL SECTION

  
  
The mod is extremely lightweight (only one swapped script which runs in place of the vanilla one, also with only minor additions) and comes ESL flagged right out the gate (with an optional ESP version, if for whatever reason you might want that).
  
  
I added an additional faction which gets assigned on top of the standard crime faction the guards and the prisoner get - this stops them from reporting crimes done to them in front of each other. They will however still report other crimes as normal as I have not touched the base vanilla factions. This means any changes to the vanilla crime factions of the hold will still affect them. **They will still report crimes done to them and act accordingly to the standard crime faction of the hold they spawned in!**
  
Aside from that I have added a new script to the quests **WE09** (Imperials) and **WE32** (Thalmor) which replaces one of the vanilla scripts respectively and set their references to be initialised with my new faction instead of none. This means any changes to those two quests might and can overwrite my modifications. I have NOT changed any vanilla scripts - everything is untouched. This means there should be zero script compatibility issues from my side.
  
  
**USSEP is flagged as master**, but technically not required. If people prefer a complete standalone version for whatever reason, I can upload one (If you don't run USSEP even god can't help you son).
