[size=3]**Description**
  
  
This mod increases the fines that you have to pay to be reinstated to the [Dark Brotherhood](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Honor_Thy_Family), [College of Winterhold](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Rejoining_the_College) and [Thieves Guild](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Reparations) after committing a crime against a guild member. It complements mods that make the economy more harsh, increase prices, bounties, etc.
  
  
The vanilla fines are:
  
  
Dark Brotherhood
  

  
* 500
If your're the Listener: 300
  

College of Winterhold
  

  
* First time: 250
Second time: 500
  
* Third time and thereafter: 1000

Thieves Guild
  

  
* 1000

In the installer i provided presets that multiply these fines by 2, 5 and 10 times. You can also set any values by changing global variables from this mod in xEdit or CK:
  
SpoilerDark Brotherhood
  

  
* DBEvictionGold (FExxx800)
If the player is the Listener - DBEvictionGoldListener (FExxx801)
  

College of Winterhold

  
* For the first time - MGRejoinGold1 (FExxx804)
For the second time - MGRejoinGold2 (FExxx805)
  
* For the third time and thereafter - MGRejoinGold3 (FExxx806)

Thieves Guild (vanilla)
  

  
* TGBanGoldTotal (000B03A6)
The problem with changing these fines, except the Thieves Guild one, is that they are hardcoded and mentioned in dialogues. I tried my best to edit the dialogues by cutting off specific values from them (UHDAP was used as a base). Everything has been linked to global variables, which can be easily edited.
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
  

  
* Conflicts with mods that change the reinstatement quests and these fines. Of course, other mods must not overwrite this one, otherwise it won't work.
Compatible: [Trade and Barter](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23081)﻿, [Economy Overhaul and Speechcraft Improvements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9542)﻿, [Reparations - No More](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20421)﻿.
  
* [SkyRem - Eve](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26325)﻿ changes the Thieves Guild fine to 10000. If you prefer the value from my mod, place my mod after SkyRem Eve. If you prefer the one from SkyRem Eve, place it after my mod.
