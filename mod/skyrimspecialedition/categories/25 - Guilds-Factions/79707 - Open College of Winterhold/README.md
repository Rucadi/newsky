# Open College of Winterhold

**Introduction**
  
  
This mod is designed to fix the following issues of the vanilla College entry procedure:
  

  
* You're forced to join the College for the main quest, Dawnguard quest and some mod-added content.
Faralda stays on the bridge literally 24/7 without sleeping, eating or anything else.
  
* Once the player joins the College, Faralda never returns to the bridge anymore and the doors are now always open, as if your entry solved all conflicts with local nords (all for the Dovahkiin's convenience).
The magic pillars on the bridge make no sense. If they open the gate then it's dumb (how does Faralda return to the College, lights them each time? ah, yes...) and the fact that they eventually go out makes it even worse. If lighting them is some magical ritual that "introduces" you to the College then why they stay for so long?
  
* The Faralda's test is limited to 5 vanilla spells. Playing an ice mage? Cast the damn fireball. This also causes inconsistency if some mod changes the level of some of these spells.
Very limited dialogue options when Faralda asks you what you want to find within the College. Like, what if i want to destroy my opps with just fire, not ice and fire?
  

[size=3]**Access to the College**
  
  
The College is now open. Faralda no longer guards the bridge and now follows her normal schedule (in vanilla she just sits in her room), everyone else also lives normally. The magic pillars on the bridge are lit initially and never go out. Conditions are added to vanilla dialogues that refer to you as a newbie, dialogues that mention stringent entry procedures are disabled.
  
  
By default you can't trade and train with College mages, but you can enable one or both features in the Open College MCM. College quests are not available until you join the College. Ownership is added to College interior cells that didn't have it and items in the courtyard, so that you can't take items without stealing and sleep in the player's room until you join the College.
  
  
Changed the behavior of the main College gate. In vanilla it was something weird: when you join the gate automatically opens, and if you close it manually it will open automatically the next time you approach, and only the player triggers it. Also the gate triggerbox was set up just awful, so that the gate opened on the half of the way from the Hall of Elements to the gate. This mod makes the gate fully automatic and triggered by anyone so that it opens when someone approaches and closes when everyone walks away. The triggerbox is also fixed. In the MCM you can change it to manual mode.
  
  
**Joining the College**
  
  
Changed the test that you need to pass in order to join the College. After you speak to Faralda and take the the test, she will lead you to the Hall of the Elements, where you need to cast any Apprentice or higher level spell to demonstrate your abilities. All the dialogues are voiced with vanilla and sliced/spliced lines. After Faralda accepts you into the College, everything goes as usual. While you're on the tour with Mirabelle Ervine, Tolfdir and the students go to the Hall of the Elements.
  
  
You can also ask any member of the College how to join. For obvious reasons they won't actually say anything useful (just "Of course"/"Yes"), but it will start the quest with an objective pointing to Faralda.
  
  
Provided more options for what robes Mirabelle Ervine gives to you. By default you always get Destruction robes like in vanilla, but in the MCM you can change it to robes with just magicka regen enchantment, no enchantment at all or an enchantment selected automatically based on the spell that you cast during the test or your highest skill.

**[size=3]Compatibility**[/size]
  
  
This mod will conflict with other mods changing the College entry and the First Lessons quest, as well as college trainers dialogues. Make sure that nothing overwrites Open College scripts and that Open College.esp is placed after any conflicting mods, otherwise something may be broken.
  
  
This mod also conflicts with mods changing the College appearance that move/remove/replace objects in the College courtyard and the player's bed. You can simply place such mods after Open College.esp, though the conflicting and newly added objects won't have ownership, therefore it's better to create a patch.

Open College only changes vanilla stuff. If you want to create consistency patches, this is what you should do:
  

  
* New vendors in the College: find the vendor (services) factions and copy conditions from any of the factions included in Open College.esp.
New trainers in the College: add their references (not base records) to CollegeTrainers formlist, the references must be persistent (have Persistent flag). If the trainer doesn't have the trainer dialogue before joining the College even with the "Train Without Joining" option enabled, there is probably a condition on their dialogue (like [size=2]Target.GetInFaction(CollegeofWinterholdFaction)=1) that you'll also need to remove.[/size]
  
* New interior cells in the College: add cells that don't have any Ownership (not including Midden) or have Ownership set to [size=2]CollegeCellsToAddOwnership but don't have a "Public Area" flag to CollegeCellsToAddOwnership formlist. There may be exceptions. Adding a cell to [size=2]CollegeCellsToAddOwnership [/size] dynamically sets [size=2]CollegeofWinterholdFaction[/size] as the cell owner and adds a "Public Area" flag. Without ownership you obviously will be able to take any items for free. If the cell has ownership but no "Public Area" flag, then visiting that cell will count as trespassing when you're not in the owner faction.[/size]
New objects in the College courtyard that can be taken: set ownership to CollegeofWinterholdFaction.
  
* New player bed accessible before joining the College: add the reference to CollegePlayerBeds formlist, the reference must be persistent (have Persistent flag).
New dialogues that refer to the player as a newbie: add ﻿condition Target.GetInFaction(CollegeofWinterholdFaction)=1 or GetStage(MG01)>=30 (both are vanilla-compatible).
