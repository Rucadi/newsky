Wanted to **exploit the Skeleton Key's potential for real** and not just have it be a limitless lockpick? **Hated selling your soul to Nocturnal** just to progress the questline?
  
  
This mod adds **4 new voice-acted endings** to the Thieves Guild questline, including new story, new rewards, new boss fights.
  
The roleplaying freedom you have been asking for since the first time you finished that questline.
  
  
  
The 4 new endings:
  
  
1. Defy Nocturnal - free all Nightingales including yourself, Karliah, Brynjolf and Gallus from the Dark Mistress
  
2. Betray Nocturnal - take the Skeleton Key for yourself and exploit its unlimited potential
  
3. Exorcise the Key - work with the Vigilants of Stendarr to purge Nocturnal's influence from Nirn forever
  
4. Refuse to be a Nightingale - the vanilla ending without becoming a Nightingale
  
  
*Comes with **full NPC recognition** of the new endings, includingnew epilogues with Karliah and Brynjolf.*
  
  
  
The prize:
  
  
1. Gratitude of the Nightingales - the freed Nightingales give you their shadows, boosting your stealth and thieving skills
  
2. Unlimited Potential - all skills level 25% faster
  
3. Bane of the Nightwalkers - automatically break invisibility of all foes within 10 yards
  
4. Nocturnal's Trinket - a ring that boosts your stealth and thieving skills
  
  
  
  
  
Q&A:
  
  
Q1: How do I save Karliah?
  
A1: Tell her you want to free the Nightingales AND actually free the Nightingales.
  
  
Q2: I don't like the addition of ESO lore about Nocturnal
  
A2: Not a question.
  
  
Q3: Is this lore-friendly?
  
A3: As lore-friendly as possible
  
  
Q4: Is this compatible with...
  
A4: Any mod that modifies the last three quests of the Thieves Guild questline will need patches. Other mods are fine.
  
  
Q5: Install mid-game?
  
A5: Install at any point before Karliah asks you to become a Nightingale. Or at the latest, **before you kill Mercer.**
  
  
Q6: ESL?
  
A6: Yes.
  
  
Q7: Why is the Slave of Shadow essential?
  
A7: She is protected by her other parts (and Karliah if she sides with Nocturnal). Kill all other enemies to make the Slave of Shadow vulnerable.
  
  
  
  
**Modder information**
  
  
If you wish to make your mod reference the new endings, you DO NOT need to make this mod a master file.
  
  
Simply run a condition check:
  
If **Karliah** is in the faction **IvarsteadKlimmekHouseFaction**, then she has joined the player against Nocturnal.
  
If **Brynjolf** is in the faction **IvarsteadKlimmekHouseFaction**, then the player chose to free the Nightingales.
  
If **Brynjolf** is in the faction **IvarsteadTembaFaction**, then the player chose to claim the Skeleton Key and killed Karliah in the process.
  
If **Brynjolf** is in the faction **IvarsteadVilemyrInnFaction**, then the player chose to exorcise the key with the Vigilant of Stendarr and killed Karliah in the process.
  
  
To check whether Thieves Guild Alternative Endings is installed in the player's game, simply run the check:
  
If **Brynjolf** is in the faction **RiverwoodRiverwoodTraderFaction**, then the player has installed Thieves Guild Alternative Endings.
  
  
You don't need to make this mod a master file. However, please still list this mod as an optional requirement so that the players know how to access the new endings.
