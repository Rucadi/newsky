Description
  
  
Changes to the College of Winterhold:
  
  
First Lessons (MG01)
  

  
* Faralda's force-greet trigger has been moved back to the bridge so you can have a friendlier dialogue with her. (credit: [Misc. College of Winterhold Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22653)﻿ - Friendly Faralda by SomethingObscure)
You can ask Faralda to join the college straight away.
  
* You can choose a favored school of magic when speaking to Faralda at the entrance.
Faralda will not sell you the spell to cast and will instead tell you to go to the court wizards to get it (revert to vanilla behavior by setting MGI\_FaraldaSellsSpells to 1).
  
* Several errors in the journal entries for the entry tests are fixed.
You can enter the College by shouting after completing The Way of the Voice (MQ105).
  
* Faralda will not repeat herself saying "Well done indeed." before leading you across the bridge.
Faralda will not randomly stop to greet you while leading you to the gate.
  
* Faralda will finish lighting the wells even if you run past her.
Mirabelle will give you the appropriate robes corresponding to your entry test.
  
* You have the option to skip the tour with Mirabelle.
Tolfdir will not start the lesson if you have not spoken to Mirabelle and started or skipped the tour.
  
* Tolfdir will not repeatedly force-greet you after speaking about the ward spell.
Lesser Ward will not be added automatically if you knew Steadfast or Greater Ward.
  

Under Saarthal (MG02)

  
* Tolfdir and the apprentices' automatic greetings that they can use while walking to Saarthal will not stop them from moving.
Rearranged some of Tolfdir's dialogue options during the quest to be more natural.
  
* Fixed Nerien greeting you with generic lines (e.g. "Those are College of Winterhold robes, aren't they?") when he first appears.
Reduced mist FX in the burial shaft to increase visibility of the section underneath.
  
* Tolfdir will not interrupt himself or randomly force-greet you after his monologue in the burial shaft.
Savos Aren will give you a leveled Staff of Turning instead of a Staff of Magelight.
  

Good Intentions (MG04)
  

  
* You are completely blocked from entering the Arch-Mage's Quarters at the start of the quest, where entering would break the game.
Adjusted the Augur of Dunlain's lines that would play in the Midden Dark as you approach so that they will occur more consistently. (credit: [Misc. College of Winterhold Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22653)﻿ - The Augur's Admonishment by SomethingObscure)
  

Miscellaneous
  

  
* It is possible to break into the Arch-Mage's Quarters either by picking the lock or pickpocketing Savos Aren. This makes it possible to get the Unusual Gem/Stone of Barenziah.
Lecture scenes have been altered so that attendees show up early and the lectures start at 2:00 PM more consistently.
  
* Phinis won't give his lecture about the object from Saarthal before completing Under Saarthal (MG02).
NPCs added by mods will no longer use unvoiced greetings after you become Arch-Mage.
  
* Fixed Brelyna's practice spells being able to be absorbed, which would break the quest.
Fixed a misaligned door in the Midden Dark. (credit: [Misc. College of Winterhold Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22653)﻿ - Erratum Etc. by SomethingObscure)
  
* A book which Urag reports missing can no longer be found on College grounds. (credit: [Misc. College of Winterhold Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22653)﻿ - Erratum Etc. by SomethingObscure)
Allow the player to use Magelight to light/re-light the wells on the bridge (credit: [Misc. College of Winterhold Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22653)﻿ - Mage-Light Maintenance by SomethingObscure)
