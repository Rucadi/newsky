# Vilkas Spar Skip

Made at the suggestion of [Dabiggieboss](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5843790)﻿ ([Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@biggie_boss)). When you decide to join companions, Kodlak asks Vilkas to have a fight with you in order to test your arm. This objective often bugs out, sometimes he outright kills the player, or misconstruedes your breathing as "magic attack" and gets antsy. This little mod skips this nonsense. When you go to the yard, you'll have a dialog option, "So you're supposed to train me?", and he'll just give you the next objective.
  
  
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
This edits a few vanilla records to make the skip happen. Best check in xEdit. I checked with [LoreRim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/112590) which has ~3.5K mods, no conflicts.
