# Companions Dialogue Bundle

The Companions is my favorite faction in the game. It's the first one you encounter and as someone who mainly plays warrior types, it's the natural choice. However, it does get a bit stale and after a few times visiting Jorrvaskr, you kind of stop caring. This mod probably doesn't solve that problem fully, but at least it makes an attempt. By adding more dialogue options, new dialogue from the various Companions, and fleshing out some of them, it makes the experience a bit fresh again.
  
  
One of the things I've decided to spend a lot of time on was using the very under-utilized Skjor. He dies pretty early, but his death doesn't mean much to you because you never got to know him. The mod adds a few new dialogue options only for Skjor, where you can ask him for some advice every once in a while and ask him to tell a story from the Great War. The mod also aims to flesh out the minor Companions members such as Ria by adding more misc dialogue and scenes for her.
  
  
This is NOT an extensive overhaul of the faction itself, but it fits well into any playthrough where you want a more fully fleshed experience of the Companions.

**Features**
  
  
- Fully voiced dialogue, using a mix of ElevenLabs AI, vanilla dialogue and spliced edits.
  
- Adds new dialogue options to the main questline of the Companions.
  
 ﻿- Tell Aela you couldn't make it to the Giant in time if it's dead.
  
 ﻿- Tell Aela you already know who the Companions are (Skips the "An outsider, eh?" dialogue)
  
 ﻿- Ask the Circle members where you can find Kodlak. (So you don't have to rely on the quest marker constantly)
  
 ﻿- Ask Skjor if he has any awesome stories from the Great War.
  
 ﻿- Ask Skjor if he has any advice for you (can be asked once a day, there are 6 available advice)
  
- Adds 7 new scenes between Companions
  
 ﻿ - Aela & Ria
  
 ﻿- Farkas & Vilkas
  
 ﻿- Ria & Torvar
  
 ﻿- Njada & Athis
  
 ﻿- Ria & Njada
  
 ﻿- Aela & Farkas
  
 ﻿- Skjor & Vilkas
  
- Adds new misc dialogue to various Companion members.
  
 ﻿- Njada will have more misc dialogue with her usual attitude.
  
 ﻿- Ria will have more random dialogue to counter the two repetitive lines she has.
  
 ﻿- Torvar will have some new dialogue about mead and fighting.
  
 ﻿- Athius will have some new dialogue.
  
 ﻿- Vilkas, Farkas & Aela have some new misc dialogue, but not as much as the minor Companions do.
  
- While not dialogue related, this mod fixes the issue where the Companion who has given you a quest just stands by the door. This mod fixes that so that scenes can play out more organically.
  
  
Some dialogue will be very obvious-AI quality, but this is mostly due to their voice being hard to replicate. Mainly for Torvar & Farkas, thus they have slightly less dialogue added.
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
  
- There are a few other mods that make it so the Companions don't wait around the dorr after giving quests (Companions ain't hachikos & At your own pace come to mind). These shouldn't cause any conflicts.
  
- Forwarded changes from USSEP.
