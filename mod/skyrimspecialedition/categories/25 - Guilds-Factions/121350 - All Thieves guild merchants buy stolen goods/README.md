Q: Isn't the one merchant the pervious mod missed the bar tender? Who has like 150 gold and only buys food and drink? 
  
  
A: ....Yes
  
  
Q: Why would I even want to sell things to him?
  
  
A: It's about the principal of the situation. I don't think the TG bar tender should make a fuss about whether what you're selling him is stolen or not. 
  
  
Q: Did you seriously make an entire mod over a mod not including the games least useful merchant?
  
  
A:....Yes
