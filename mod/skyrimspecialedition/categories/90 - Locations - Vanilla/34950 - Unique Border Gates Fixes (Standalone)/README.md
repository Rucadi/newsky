Duinnin's Unique Border Gates is a fantastic mod, and one that has never left my load order. This is an ESL-Flagged version which fixes a number of bugs, including the removal of word borders from the original mod. In addition, there are included updated\fixed ESL versions of the original patches, as well as additional ones.
  
The Beyond Skyrim: Bruma patch is [here](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34955).

ABOUT UNIQUE BORDER GATES
  
  
Unique Border Gates redesigns the border crossings of Cyrodill, Hammerfell and Morrowind by adding new, unique and immersive gates. No two are alike and I believe the design reflects the area well. Each location is discoverable and you can fast travel after discovery.
  
  
The following are brief descriptions of each gate.
  
  

  
* Dunmeth Pass
    
  Located in northeastern Eastmarch Hold along the northern road leading into Morrowind, this gate is of Imperial design. It has recently experienced a destructive skirmish during the Civil War.

  

  
* Pale Pass
    
  Located in southeastern Falkreath Hold along the road leading into Cyrodiil, this gate is all that remains of an old ruined fortress. Imperial soldiers have fortified the gate to protect the Pale Pass.

  

  
* Silgrad Pass
    
  Located in eastern Riften Hold along the southern road leading into Morrowind, this gate is of Riften design. A common route for bandits and smugglers.

  

  
* Talos Pass
    
  Located in southwestern Falkreath Hold along the road leading into Hammerfell, this gate is of ancient Nord design. It features massive stone structures and an impenetrable iron gate. It is so named in dedication to Talos, said to have spent time in the region, with a statue frequented by adventurers heading west.
