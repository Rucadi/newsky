﻿ **- Description -**

[/font]The **Temple of Dibella** is a place of worship built atop a crag overlooking the entire city of [Markarth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/search/?BH=0&RH_ModList=nav:false,home:false,type:0,user_id:0,game_id:1704,advfilt:true,search%5Bfilename%5D:HS%20Markarth,search%5Bauthor%5D:Hylios%20Sykes,include_adult:true,page_size:20,show_game_filter:false,open:true,sort_by:OLD_u_downloads). The temple is operated and maintained by a group of exclusively female priestesses spreading the Faith of Dibella - Goddess of love, beauty, art and music - to the people of the Reach. Apart from the publicly available shrine that constitute the upper level of the temple, it is said that the priestesses spend most of their time in seclusion in the inner sanctum, causing the imagination of most of the local men to run wild thinking about what might go on in that most secret of places.

﻿ **- Installation -**

[/font]- Make sure your version of [HS Resources](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72307) is up to date, if not, download and install the latest release, this is a mandatory requirement and you might be missing some items if you're using an outdated version. Make sure to track the mod as well so you get notified of any update.
  
- Use a mod manager software such as [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/1)﻿, install, enable the mod and *voilà!*
  
- **Or** drop the content of the archive into your "Skyrim Special Edition\Data" folder
  
  
The Loot auto-sort should take care of the rest, but if I'm a bit behind in committing the rules for the newly released mods or if you want to mess around your Load Order on your own it is recommended to load this mod fairly late in the LO to prevent any other mods to mess with visual elements of the cell, patches might be required in some cases but I will not be making them myself unless I'm personally using the mod.
  
  
**Add-ons included in the optional files :**
  
  
- A Compatibility patch disabling ELFX changes made to the cell edited by this mod.
  
- A Compatibility patch disabling LUX changes made to the cell edited by this mod.

﻿ **- Compatibility -**

[/font]If I get the chance, I shall list below some of the mods that have been reported as incompatible and requiring patching, I will not be making any patches myself as mentioned in my FAQ.

﻿ **- Disclaimer -**

[/font]The mod as well as the patches are ESL flagged. I will not be releasing variants or All-In-One versions of these mods since that will go against the "modular" philosophy behind them, letting you pick and choose which location you want to install and having multiple version of the same thing would quickly make this a nightmare to maintain.
