FEATURED
  
  
Thanks to Master Cheesey for featuring my mod! :)
  
  
  
  
A small overhaul of the Troll Den on the way to High Hrothgar.
  
Creating a more claustrophobic landscape for the end of the Seven Thousand Steps.

Adds some *Immersive* clutter to the den as well as a new tenant.
  
  
  
I created this mod to increase the difficulty on the way to High Hrothgar to slow the main quest down a little and turning It into a boss area.
