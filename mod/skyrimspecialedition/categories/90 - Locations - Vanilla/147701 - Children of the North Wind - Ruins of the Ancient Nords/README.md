> For a society that valued the teaching of the Tear Wife Dibella, Ancient Nordic Architecture is sorely lacking in diversity and creativity. If it weren't for the landscapes, quests, and memories made along the way, many of these ancient tombs would be nearly indistinguishable from each other. As a mod author who has primarily worked with Nordic architecture, it has become increasingly difficult to create new permutations of the same monotonous blend of blocky stone arches, hawk themed furniture, and bearded stone faces.

> In this overhaul, c[/font][font=Times New Roman]ertain aesthetic features will receive conflict free variations to their current placement. No longer will the Ancient Nord Hivemind construct the entirety of their domain the same!

[font=Verdana]**Mod features:**[/font][font=Arial]
  
[/font][font=Verdana](All of these features are toggleable in the FOMOD)[/font]
  
 **Animal Totems:**
  

  
* Replaces the iconic Hawk Motif used in various ancient Nordic architecture/clutter with variants based on the other 8 animal totems of the Nordic Pantheon.
Animals Added. (Bear, Dragon, Fox, Moth, Owl, Snake Whale & Wolf)
  
* Swaps Both Nordic totem poles, and Arches.
These totems are dynamically swapped to various Nordic Ruins based on the known lore of the location, along with the themes involved in quests that happen in the location.
  
* Examples: Dragon Cult temples like Labyrinthian & Skuldafn get dragon totems, While Gjukar's Monument, a location associated with a Mara quest, receives the wolf totem.
Certain unique locations gain unique totems that are unique from their totem counterparts. Explore to find them all!
  

  
**Assorted Clutter:**
  

  
* Adds variants to typical clutter you will find in any generic Ancient Nordic Ruin.
Linen now appears in 5 colors. (Plain, Green, Lavender, Light Blue, & Red)
  
* Large urns have received 3 new color variants. (Tan, Grey, & White)
Distributed to all Nordic Barrows via BOS. (Base Object Swapper)
  

  
**Assorted Sculpture Heads:**
  

  
* Adds diversity to the iconic Nordic sculpture head.
All locations with no specific theme can swap into one of 4 helmet types.
  
* Bespoke locations, such as Dragon Cult Locations or mage oriented locations will receive Nordic heads with more specific head-wear.

  
**Daedric Clutter:**
  

  
* This Add-on gives Daedric locations unique clutter to fit their specific patron.
Currently Includes Clavicus Vile (Heretical Haemar's Shame Required), Dagon, Meridia, & Nocturnal themed clutter.
  
* Distributes these clutter variants to their respective locations.

  
**Dragon Cult Bronze:**
  

  
* Adds an extra layer of diversity to Nordic ruins by swapping metallic clutter in dragon cult locations with new bronze variants.
Every piece of metal in bespoke locations has been swapped.
  
* A new enemy type, The Draugr Honorguard, (Lvl 40) now spawns guarding the crypts of the Dragon Cult. These enemies drop unique Bronzed Nordic Weaponry that does more damage than the average Ancient Nordic Weaponry. (Currently removed)
Adds a unique set of Dragon Cult Armor spread throughout various dragon priest temples!
  

  
**Location Changes:**
  

  
* Changes various locations in the world beyond what a typical BOS swap file could easily do.
Dragon Priest and named boss coffins have received custom shaped sarcophagi with specially designed lids. (Priest Coffins will swap to bronze if Dragon Cult Bronze Module is selected/enabled)
  
* Dragon Bridge & the Skuldafn Portal have [color=#f4f4f4][size=2]received custom models with specialized footprints.[/size][/color]
Custom locations with distinct themes have received unique changes to their clutter and lighting.
  
* Brand new unique building meshes that replace entire entryways.
Overhauls major Dragon Cult/Priest dungeons & locations in an immersive & lore friendly way. (Forelhost was a once great monastery and last known holdout of the Dragon Cult. It took King Harald's forces several long, grueling months of siege before they were finally able to bring down Forelhost's main gate with the power of the Voice. Forelhost has been completely overhauled. A sprawling, monolithic temple structure now fallen into disrepair and ruin...)
  

  
  
**(All of the above, besides the Location Changes plugin, are meant to be compatible by default with any location overhaul utilizing vanilla Nordic Eagle Totem Architecture. Eg. Any totems added by a mod like Ryn's Lost Valley Redoubt, will automatically swap into Bear Totems with my mod enabled)****Future Plans:**
  
  

  
* More Totemic Variants
More reworks to large Ancient Nordic Complexes
  
* Completing the Nordic/Daedric Clutter Hybrids
More comprehensive SWAP files for BOS
  
* Expansion to Nordic Metals
