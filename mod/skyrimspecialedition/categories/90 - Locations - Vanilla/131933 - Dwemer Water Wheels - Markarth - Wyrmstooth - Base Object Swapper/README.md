**FAQ**
  
> ﻿Q: According to my gut feelings, metal is heavier. How can heavy things move?
>   
> A: According to classical mechanics, higher moment of inertia reduces angular acceleration, but if the torque applied by the water flow can overcome the friction at the axle, the wheel's tangential velocity will still eventually reach the flow velocity of the water, so at steady state, the power output should be the same. Higher moment of inertia will result in the slower reaction to variable flow, which may be desirable for more steady power output. Also, this water wheel design is already canon and featured in [Runoff Caverns](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Runoff_Caverns): [Dwemer water wheels](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/131933/131933-1729432933-634387719.png)﻿.

>   
> Q: But what about normal force and friction at the axle?
>   
> A: The Dwemer used very efficient bearings, lubricating [Dwemer Oil](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dwarven_Oil)﻿, and strong [Dwemer metals](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dwarven_Metal)﻿ for the axle.
>   
>   
> Q: The Dwemer don't use water wheels! Water wheels are too primitive!
>   
> A: The Dwemer used many similar [Dwemer water wheels](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/131933/131933-1729432933-634387719.png) in [Runoff Caverns](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Runoff_Caverns).
>   
>   
> Q: The Nords clearly made the water wheel in Markarth!
>   
> A: [The Markarth water wheel is connected directly to a Dwemer mechanism made out of Dwemer metal, stonework, and gears. And this mechanism is not connected to the forge or any other part of the smithy.](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/131933/131933-1729771640-896159474.png)﻿ It is not immediately obvious that the Nords are using the the Dwemer mechanism for anything in particular. Based entirely on what's in Skyrim, It is much more likely that the original Dwemer mechanism already included a water wheel before the Nords occupied Markarth.
