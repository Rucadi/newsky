A very cozy and lush overhaul to **The Drunken Huntsman**, bringing a bit of Valenwood to Whiterun, featuring custom high-quality assets.

[font=Tahoma]**? OVERVIEW**[/font]
  
  
While tweaking some lighting I realized how plain the Drunken Huntsman is. Nordic life in Skyrim can be sparse, sure, but I feel like its owners, Elrindir and Anoriath, would have wanted the place to feel like home, and to stand out against the other inns and taverns.
  
  
I started by simply adding a couple of plants here and there, then some ivy, then couldn't stop. I ended up adding all sorts of custom assets, including 32 brand-new high quality climbing/hanging vines and flowers. Also included are some new pelt-covered chairs to make things feel a bit more warm.
  
  
Instead of large statues, grandiose banners, and complete layout changes, I opted to keep the vanilla layout, and stick with a cozy, understated hunter vibe, for a vanilla++ feel and high compatibility.
  
  
I feel the end result is an extremely warm, cozy atmosphere that would make any Wood Elf feel at home.
  
  
An optional plugin for the exterior will add some ivy and vines and a banner to the exterior of the shop to prepare you for the lush interior within.
  
  
The upstairs guest room has been left mostly untouched. It makes sense to me that they would leave the guest room more neutral. Plus, that's where Nazeem sleeps, so he can deal with a plain room ?
  
  
[font=Tahoma]**? REQUIREMENTS**[/font]
  
  
Uses some assets from the Anniversary Edition \_ResourcePack.esl, so that is required.
  
  
It's not a hard requirement, but this was built with [High Quality Ivy Replacer - Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/113578) and is HIGHLY recommended.
  
  
Also not required, but this was designed around ENB light being present. So if you aren't using ENB with particle lights enabled, some of the light sources (candles, Bosmer pods) will not emit light. But it won't break anything.
  
  
[font=Tahoma]**? COMPATIBILITY**[/font]
  
  
This does not alter lighting in any way, so it's fully compatible with any lighting overhaul (i.e. ELFX or LUX), including vanilla.
  
  
Patches may need to be made for major overhauls that heavily modify this interior.
  
  
A patch for **[JKs The Drunken Huntsman](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33783)** is available in the optional files.
  
  
[font=Tahoma]**? INSTALLATION & LOAD ORDER**[/font]
  
  
Install the main file. Optional files include a lightweight exterior overhaul that is compatible with most town overhauls, and an extra ENB light module that adds ENB lights to the open ceiling areas for extra sunlight.
  
  
All plugins are ESL-flagged ESPs which do not take up a load order slot. The assets are packaged into BSA archives.
  
  
It's just static decorations so this can be added to your game at any time.
  
  
**IMPORTANT!** Make sure you load this mod early in your load order, BEFORE your lighting overhauls, or the interior cell data will be reverted to vanilla.

The vine plants pack was created by LetsMakeCoolArt on CGTrader, where a Royalty Free License was purchased. I edited and made them usable for Skyrim.
  
  
I hope you enjoy!
