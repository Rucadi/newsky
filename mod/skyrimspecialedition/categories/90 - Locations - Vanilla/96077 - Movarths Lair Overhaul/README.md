Movarth's Lair Overhaul is a simple, all vanilla overhaul to the Movarth's Lair dungeon. The original dungeon shows a vampire clan squatting in an abandoned mine and living in squalor. This redesign keeps most of the original design but demonstrates that the vampires have worked on improving their base of operations and accumulated some wealth and luxury. The lair starts exactly the same as before, descending a mine shaft filled with spiders, but as you go deeper you'll find more and more signs that the vampires have been reworking the mine in to a proper underground castle. The prior throne room is now a hub room used for training and a new area made of proper worked stone serves as Movarth's inner sanctum.
  
  
  
The overhaul also adds more loot and enemies to make the master vampire's lair a little more exciting. The dungeon's minimum level has also been increased from 6 to 12 and there are now a couple unleveled enemies. The intention is that the player should be at least level 20, although the dungeon can be managed at lower levels. If you can defeat the vampire mistwalker acting as a door guard, you're at the right power level.
