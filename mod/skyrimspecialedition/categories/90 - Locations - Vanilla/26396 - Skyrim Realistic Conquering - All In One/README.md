Turn Skyrim into a dynamic world that repopulates lost locations. You as the adventurer clear locations of it's foul inhabitants on a daily basis, but with this mod, you will actually be able to see Skyrim become a better place. Turn locations that are inhabited by monsters\* back into realistic and liveable settlements. Depending on their surroundings, previous structures, inhabitants and resources, locations are changed in a lore friendly AF way. You will also find some short inconsequential quests to give new life to these locations.
  
  
\*Monsters: Creatures and NPCs which inhabit locations after being abandoned by the owner. 
  
    For example: wolfs, spiders, witches, bandits and such.

  
  

Using [Fort Takeovers Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25143)﻿ these locations dynamically change towards a better future. Make Skyrim the world your efforts deserve it to be!
