**[﻿[b]Statue of Kynareth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/91358)**﻿[/b]

  
After The Battle for Whiterun, the statue of Talos is replaced with Kynareth's Statue. 
  
  
How it works:
  

  
* After the Battle for Whiterun (On the Imperial Side), it will trigger the quest stage that will set how long it will take the talos statue to be removed and when the Kynareth Statue will be put up.
After the battle, the Talos statue and shrine will be removed in 2 to 5 days (Random) leaving empty space.
  
* After the Talos statue is removed, the Kynareth statue and shrine will be put up in 5 to 7 more days.
Danica will sandbox in front of the statue after the Talos statue is removed.
  
* Danica will spend 6 hours starting at 11am in front of the statue sandboxing during weekdays.
Danica has two new lines. One after the Talos statue is removed, and another once the Kynareth statue is put up.
  

  
Requires [SPID](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869) for the AI Packages to be distributed to Danica.
  
NOTE: The quest packages for the [Gildergreen quest](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Blessings_of_Nature) will take priority unfortunately, so she won't use the new packages until after you tell her you'll get Nettlebane.
  
  
Patch available for [Capital Whiterun](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37982).
  
(Also fixes the thalmor guy from showing up early in the process)
  
  
Should be compatible with any mod that doesn't touch the Talos statue in Whiterun in any significant way.
