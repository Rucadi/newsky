# Goldenglow Is Yours

I'll begin with what this is not: This isn't *another* hyper-stylish, all-gadgets player home.
  
Personally, I find the new-player-home galore a little boring, get them all and most of Skyrim is yours -- you could just evict the dragons, no need to kill them.
  
This is meant as a small lore-friendly immersion mod.
  
You can sleep in your mansion, stroll around proudly, get an income, store stuff.
  
  
One day, lad, all this shall be yours!Spoiler
  
  
**Ownership**
  

  
* Aringoth and the mercenaries are removed.
All the items are yours.
  
* The master bed gives the well-rested bonus.
The interior containers are set to no-respawn for safe storage.
  
* The beehives are repaired and a few farmers/beekeepers (and four chickens!) are working at the estate. The workers (chickens excluded) have a daily schedule and a bed to sleep in.
You get a copy of the keys (in case you're still missing some of them).
  
* You find the estate's monthly revenues in a box inside the main bedroom (25,000/year, more or less). If you don't retrieve the gold, it keeps accumulating.
Once the 'Scoundrel's Folly' quest is completed, you can bring the deed to Maven and sell the Estate for a whopping 60,000 gold. You lose the ownership, the keys, and the monthly income.
  
* Boat travel to and from Honeyside. It can be enabled or disabled by an activator [see image] in the master bedroom. The activator is available when you get the ownership. The service is initially disabled.

**How to start**
  
Soon after leaving Brinewater Grotto with your deed during the 'Scoundrel's Folly' Thieves Guild quest (if you had already got it before installing this, pick it up again and bring it along for a while), you get the traditional "visit your new property" miscellaneous quest objective.
  
Entering the building completes the objective.
  
  
**MCM version**
  
Allows to customize monthly income and sell price.
  
  
**Compatibility note**
  
If you have mods with book edits (eg. Book Covers), the deed could still be wrongly named "Goldenglow Bill of Sale" instead of "Deed to Goldenglow Estate". 
  
I have also keyworded the deed as 'not sellable' because I often lose important stuff by mistake.
  
Although this mod doesn't need to win the conflict to work, I'd suggest to load it lower.
  
  
**Patches**
  

  
* "Legacy of the Dragonborn"
"Destroy the Thieves Guild"
