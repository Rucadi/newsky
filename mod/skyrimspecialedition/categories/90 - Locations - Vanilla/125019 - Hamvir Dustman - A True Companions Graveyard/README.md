**Harrowing Hamvir Dustman**
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------﻿

Dustman's Cairn is the first major dungeon in the Companions questline. It contains an incredibly sacred relic to the Nordic people, yet its exterior has nothing to show for it. Even stranger, Hamvir's Rest, an entirely separate and unrelated dungeon, sits literally feet away. In this mod, I have fused the two aforementioned dungeons into one mega complex, with its own identity beyond the peculiarity of vanilla. Now, Hamvir's Rest is a required stop before entering Dustman's Cairn as the hill is walled off now. A new staircase has been placed to lead to the upper level, but so have new dangers...
  
  
With Version 3.0, better synergy with my flagship mod [Children of the North Wind](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/147701)﻿ has been created, to cement this location as the true burial of a companion.
