Overview:
  
﻿
  
  
Haemar's Shame is a location we all know and love. However, most of our love for it is a combination of the awesome Daedric Quest, It's premiere loot, and of course, the lovable Barbas. The location itself however, leaves quite a bit to desire. A simple cave with the shrine of Clavicus Vile within it. The opposite of grand to be sure. In this mod, a dungeon of epic proportions has been implemented that overhauls the entirety of the interior of this dungeon. Explore an ancient desolate shrine to the God of Pacts, left to crumble in the face of an Imperial attack. Watch a Vampiric cult of Clavicus worshippers attempt to restore
  
the ruin to its former eldritch glory.
