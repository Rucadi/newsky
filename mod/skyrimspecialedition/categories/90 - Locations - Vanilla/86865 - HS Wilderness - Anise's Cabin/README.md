﻿ **- Description -**

[/font]**Anise's Cabin** is a small dwelling in Falkreath Hold. It is located south of Bleak Falls Barrow and west of [Riverwood](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86092). [Anise](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/83676) can be found here, gardening or simply sitting by the cabin's entrance. She's just a sweet old lady that does not fancy the company of others and like to spend her time in the wild communing with nature.

﻿ **- Installation -**

[/font]- Make sure your version of [HS Resources](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72307) is up to date, if not, download and install the latest release, this is a mandatory requirement and you might be missing some items if you're using an outdated version. Make sure to track the mod as well so you get notified of any update.
  
- Use a mod manager software such as [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/1)﻿, install, enable the mod and *voilà!*
  
- **Or** drop the content of the archive into your "Skyrim Special Edition\Data" folder
  
  
The Loot auto-sort should take care of the rest, but if I'm a bit behind in committing the rules for the newly released mods or if you want to mess around your Load Order on your own it is recommended to load this mod fairly late in the LO to prevent any other mods to mess with visual elements of the cell, patches might be required in some cases but I will not be making them myself unless I'm personally using the mod.
  
  
**Add-ons included in the optional files :**
  
  
- A Compatibility patch disabling ELFX changes made to the cell edited by this mod.
  
- A Compatibility patch disabling LUX changes made to the cell edited by this mod.

﻿ **- Compatibility -**

[/font]I will list bellow some of the mods that have been reported as incompatible and requiring patching, I will not be making any patches myself, this list will only serve as a remainder for those of you that actually read the description before whining in the comment section, but let's face it, nobody does, and I don't even know why I'm writing this, thank god for copy / paste.

﻿ **- Disclaimer -**

[/font]The mod as well as the patches are ESL flagged. I will not be releasing variants or All-In-One versions of these mods since that will go against the "modular" philosophy behind them, letting you pick and choose which location you want to install and having multiple version of the same thing would quickly make this a nightmare to maintain.
