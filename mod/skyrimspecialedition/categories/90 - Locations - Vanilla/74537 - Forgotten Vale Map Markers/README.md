When using mods like [size=3][A Clear Map of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56367) which gives Forgotten Vale its own world map there is a slight issue: there is no way to get out of the place without resorting to console commands. Since in the vanilla game you can use the Skyrim map to fast travel anywhere there was no need for Bethesda to add a separate exit marker. Nor is there a way to backtrack your way out, as none of the Falmer wayshrines can take you back to Darkfall Cave, and there is no physical connection. Likewise if you ever want to return to the valley it's noticeably more difficult, because the marker for the Vale is only visible on its map now, and you have to rerun through Darkfall Cave to the wayshrine.
  
  
To solve this, I made a mod that adds a map marker for Forgotten Vale to the Skyrim worldspace and a travel marker for Skyrim to the Forgotten Vale worldspace. It's meant to be used together with mods that give Forgotten Vale its own world map like [A Clear Map of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56367). Technically the mod doesn't require it, but you will see strange duplicate markers on the map if you use it with the vanilla map.
  
  
The marker for Forgotten Vale is roughly in the same place as the original one. As I had the chance, I put it in a position that should look slightly better with the clear map. It will take you to the same spot as the original marker.
  
  
The travel marker for Skyrim is placed on the eastern mountain range in the Vale, fairly close to the Darkfall Passage exit. It will take you near the entrance to Darkfall Cave.
  
  
The markers are made visible when you first enter Forgotten Vale and discover the map marker there. A [CoMAP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56123) config file is included for better markers. CoMAP is not mandatory though, without it vanilla markers will be used instead. The plugin is ESL flagged.
  
  
[/size]**Requirements:**
  
[size=3][A Clear Map of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56367) or some other mod that gives Forgotten Vale its own map. Just doesn't make a lot of sense to use the mod otherwise.
  
  
**Installation:**
  
With your chosen mod manager as usual. Make sure that the plugin loads ***before*** any world map mods, or the map will break. The higher in your load order the plugin is the better.
  
  
**Compatibility:**
  
No vanilla records have been altered so unless there is a mod that makes massive changes to the Forgotten Vale entrance area, it should be compatible with almost everything.
  
[Forgotten Vale Paper Map for FWMF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54628)﻿ - soft incompatibility. It comes with its own marker to travel out of the Vale, but not one to travel back in.
