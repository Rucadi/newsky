What does this mod do?**
  
  
  
  
> This mod adds new static objects to 16 of the 19 Military camps, which fortifies the locations without turning them Into forts.
>   
> Walls, Towers, Seige Shields, Barricades, (static) weapon racks, rock piles as well as more tents and various other clutter to make the camps look and feel lived In.
>   
>   
> The three camps not Included are related to the Civil War Quest line when on the attacking side. Whiterun, Solitude and Windhelm Military camps aren't touched, as they only appear briefly during those quests.
>   
>   
> The new added objects will appear dynamically In line with the camps themselves.
>   
> As In Vanilla, there are only a few default camps that appear at the start
>   
>  of the game, many other camps are connected to quests of the respective
>   
>  factions.
>   
> You may not see them all straight away.﻿

![](https://imgur.com/w2ghoF5.png)﻿**> [size=5]This presents a challenge and limitations to the design of the locations.
>   
> Because objects appear dynamically I could not alter any navmesh, as that would "break" areas If there were huge parts missing,
>   
> NPCs would behave as though those objects were still there If they hadn't have appeared, and tried to walk through objects that were placed over navmesh.
>   
>   
> So, things like stockade towers, walkways and stairs could not be used to their full potential. 
>   
> so I opted for a lighter fortified design.**﻿﻿[/size]**[font=Times New Roman]NAVMESH﻿[/font]**

> [font=Trebuchet MS]A solution to this problem was to use navcut collision boxes In the creation kit as well as modifying my custom meshes to also have

>   
> Doing this solves the porblem of Dynamically placed Items and Navmesh

> I have only captured the default camps In screenshots as making all the other camps trigger In game takes too much time.

> (civil war quest Is a pain, even more so doing It twice,)
>   
> Please upload nice photos of the conditional camps If you have the time.
