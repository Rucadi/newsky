﻿**Description**﻿

  
  
This mod overhauls the Temple of the Divines, located in Solitude. The mod makes almost entirely use of Skyrim assets with a few custom-made meshes to fit the needs of the Cell. it should be compatible with most HD re-meshes and re-textures out there as long as they stay close to the original shapes they are replacing. I am using a few myself and have not come across any problems so far.
  
  

**Installation**

  
- Use your favorite mod manager
  
- **Or** drop the content of the archive into your "Skyrim Special Edition\Data" folder
  
  
**Add-ons :**
  
  
- A patch for ELFX is available : it is highly recommended for those who are using it as ELFX is completely messing up the vibe of the temple.
  
  

**Compatibility**

  
  
I will list here some of the mods for which compatibility issues have been reported, these would require a patch to work properly.
  
  
**Compatible :**
  
  

  
* Tested with the frescoes mod (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47085) & shrine overhauls (JS & Ren's) and found no problems.

  
**Incompatible :**
  
  

  
* RLO and Solitude Rectory (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23735) need patching

  

**Disclaimer**

  
The mod as well as the patches are ESL flagged.
  
  
Obviously, this mod will conflict with other mods that would change the interior cell of the house in any significant way.
