**Lore Friendly Guardian Stones**

Small mod that gently overhauls the guardian stones. Compatible with probably anything besides other overhauls.
  
  
Light placer is recommended ﻿for the lanterns to have bulbs, if people want hand placed bulbs for those of you using ENB I can probably do that as well.
