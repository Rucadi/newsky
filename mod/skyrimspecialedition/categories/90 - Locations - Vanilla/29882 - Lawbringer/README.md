For an idea that I included on a whim, the ability to claim Valtheim was surprisingly well-received. People liked the idea of their actions having a lasting, positive impact on the world, and they also liked not being extorted by a bandit who didn't realize how underleveled she was. It was nice to know those bandits wouldn't be an issue for you, or anyone else, after you dealt with them once, instead of finding a new set of squatters every two weeks.
  
I've done different kinds of mods since then as my interests shift basically at random, but the idea of spreading the ability to claim locations across more and more parts of Skyrim was something people often brought up if they were talking about one of my mods. Only recently was I able to make a system that I could easily spread from one area to the next, letting you claim more and more areas as your character defeated the enemies there, stabilizing Skyrim one area at a time.
  
  
Lawbringer is a mod that lets you claim several bandit outposts for the faction you support, and it's a framework that can be expanded to let you claim any location for any faction you like. After clearing a supported area, you'll be able to find a nearby banner and use it to claim the fort. After that, waiting or leaving the fort will clear it and lead to it being taken over by the faction you claimed it for. Lawbringer supports Radiant Exclusions by default, so there's no chance of you being sent to clear a boss who no longer exists as long as you've got the Radiant Exclusions plugin.
  
  
These areas offer support for claiming for Hold Guards, the Imperials, or the Stormcloaks:

* Bleakwind Bluff
Cradlestone Tower
  
* Dragon Bridge Overlook
Lost Valley Redoubt
  

  
These areas can be claimed for the Vigil (prior to its destruction), the Volkihar if you are one, or the Dawnguard if you've joined:

Adding basic Lawbringer support to a new area takes me about 10 minutes right now. Mostly, it's a matter of drag and dropping the right things, and then my system will Just Work. Tutorials for adding basic support are included with the mod. If you have any further questions about implementation, feel free to PM me.
