**ABOUT UNIQUE BORDER GATES**   
Unique Border Gates redesigns the border crossings of Cyrodill, Hammerfell and Morrowind by adding new, unique and immersive gates. No two are alike and I believe the design reflects the area well. Each location is discoverable and you can fast travel after discovery.
  
  
   
The following are brief and spoiler-free descriptions of each gate.
  
   

  
* **Dunmeth Pass Gate**   
  Located in northeastern Eastmarch Hold along the northern road leading into Morrowind, this gate is of Imperial design. It has recently experienced a destructive battle during the Civil War.

  

  
* **Pale Pass Gate**   
  Located in southeastern Falkreath Hold along the road leading into Cyrodiil, this gate is all that remains of an old ruined fortress of Whiterun design. Imperial soldiers have fortified the gate to protect the Pale Pass.

  

  
* **Silgrad Pass Gate**   
  Located in eastern Riften Hold along the southern road leading into Morrowind, this gate is of Riften design. Last anyone knew Riften soldiers were guarding it against bandits and smugglers.

  

  
* **Talos Pass Gate**   
  Located in southwestern Falkreath Hold along the road leading into Hammerfell, this gate is of ancient Nord design. It features massive stone structures and an impenetrable iron gate.  It is so named in dedication to Talos, who is said to have spent time in the region, with a statue frequented by adventurers heading west.

  
**REQUIREMENTS**   
Skyrim Special Edition is the only requirement.
  
   
**INSTALLATION**   
The Main Section under Files contain the All-In-One version of Unique Border Gates and its compatibility patches. So if you want to use all gates with Point The Way, your load order would be:
  
   

  
* UniqueBorderGates-All.esp
Point The Way.esp
  
* UniqueBorderGates-All-PointTheWay.esp

  
The Optional Section under Files contains the various standalone versions. You should NOT use these if you're using the All version, and only use one version per gate. Load order shouldn't matter, but the ones requiring another mod need to be loaded after that mod.When updating or switching to a different version, I recommend saving your game someplace far away from any of the gates before updating. This should help avoid any unsightly errors when you install the new version.
  
   
Patches covered: (There are many more to come I just need to convert and upload them please be patient.)
