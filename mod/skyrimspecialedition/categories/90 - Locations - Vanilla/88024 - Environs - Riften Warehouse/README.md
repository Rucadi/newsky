After disrupting Riften's skooma supply during the "Supply and Demand" quest, the empty warehouse by the docks will now become an outpost for the East Empire Company. This mod will dynamically overhaul the interior as a general merchant. Once the quest is complete, a delay is implemented to make the change more gradual and feel more organic. The mod includes two new NPCs with carefully spliced voice lines.
  
  
This small, dynamic change is designed to enhance the commercial activity around Riften’s docks, and is highly compatible with other mods.
  
  
  
*\*\*\* This mod requires the latest Environs Master Plugin, found [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/91160).
  
\*\*\* Ok to install mid-game.
  
\*\*\* Safe to update from v2.00. Do not update earlier versions*

Skyrim's world space tends to feel very static. Despite a civil war, dragons, and vampires, not much ever changes. The Environs series implements changes that take place over time to help make the land of Skyrim feel more alive, to help give a sense that events are occurring and time was passing throughout a playthrough.

This mod overhauls the warehouse with a new interior that changes after the quest. Both NPCs, the Dunmer merchant and Nord assistant are implemented to fit into the game as well as possible, including custom dialogue and AI packages.
  
  
The outpost will sell assorted general goods, including imports from Solsteim. If you install the optional Bruma version, the merchant will also carry a few items from the mod, Beyond Skyrim: Bruma. (No imported weapons or armor though)
  
  
To trigger the change, you must complete the quest “Supply and Demand.” Once done, you must wait at least **15 days** in game.  The mod implements this by placing invisible trigger boxes that check and set these requirements when you pass through them, just outside each gate into Riften, including the one to the docks. Passing through any of them is necessary to read that quest is done, and to enable the outpost once enough time has passed.
  
  
There is an optional file which adds several items from Beyond Skyrim Bruma to the merchant inventory using Container Item Distributor (CID). It's available in the Patch Collection. 
  
  
  
**Important Note:**
  
This mod does not actually change the vanilla interior. Rather, it simply adds a new interior cell and switches out the exterior door. This was a super simple way to change the ownership, lock data, etc. and avoids compatibility issues. The old vanilla cell is completely untouched, and can still be accessed via console.

Does not touch the Riften worldspace at all. 
  
  
No significant changes to the Riften docks area, only adds a sign and several idle markers. However, it was necessary to touch the navmesh of this area to connect the new door. Small patches may be needed for other mods that touch the same navmesh. Several are provided.
  
  
Mods that require access to the vanilla interior after the quest may be incompatible, though I don't know of any.
