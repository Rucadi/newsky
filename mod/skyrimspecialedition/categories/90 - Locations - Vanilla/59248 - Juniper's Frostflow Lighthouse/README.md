﻿Juniper's Frostflow Lighthouse

  

[Juniper's Locations Collection](https://next.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/collections/ooqol1?utm_source=copy&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=share_collection)

  

A dream turned nightmare. A sad tale, and an empty beacon.

  
This mod cleans out the Frostflow Lighthouse after clearing the zone and makes it into a welcoming place for a weary traveler.
  
  
This mod includes added cookpots, an oven, a food and drink vendor, and a magical items merchant.
  
  
As a bonus to the player, since you are the reason the original family was found, all new clutter is available as loot. A place to sleep is located in the cellar for the player and any followers. A horse is parked outside of the lighthouse the player can make use of if they need. 
  
  
This is not a player home. All containers in the zone are respawning; it is not safe for storage. If for some reason you are storing anything in the lighthouse, you will need to remove it before adding this mod.
  
  
This can be installed any time, even if you have already cleared the lighthouse. After clearing the Frostflow Abyss, you must wait for a full cell reset (31+ game days) to see any changes if you have recently cleared the location or visited. If you cleared this location long ago, and haven't visited the area in more than 31 game days, you should see the changes right away.
  
  
Nothing in this mod will activate until you have cleared the Frostflow Abyss, so you can add it to a new game.
  
  
I've installed a button that will send you to the Frostflow Abyss entrance, if for some weird reason you didn't get your fill the first time through, you may still access the dungeon. The button is located next to where the original hole in the wall was.
  

  
* The button should not be removed. Frostflow Abyss is a radiant enabled dungeon, so you can be sent there to do quests and need access to the zone.

  
This mod will conflict with any mod that alters the Frostflow Lighthouse.
  
  
I used extra lighting when taking screenshots. The interior lighting is not that bright.
