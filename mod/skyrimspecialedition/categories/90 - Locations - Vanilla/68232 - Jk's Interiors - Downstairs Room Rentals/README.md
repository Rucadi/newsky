I really liked the new downstairs added by [Jkrojmal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/1305814) in his [Candlehearth Hall](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45617) and [Sleeping Giant Inn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35806) so I made a tweak and moved the bed that gets rented to you to one of the ones downstairs. In doing so I also removed the extra bed and added a table and chairs in the room so that you can sit with a follower in the room. Also the sleeping giant inn patch is an updated version of my patch that used to be in Janquel's [Jk's Interior Patch Collection](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35910). If you used the downstairs room rental patch from there, keep using that one in a current save, wait until a new save to use this one because I switched the rooms the rented bed is in.
  
  
Sleeping Giant inn version works with Ryn's + Jk's combo patch from [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89511?tab=description).
  
  
If you are installing this mid-save, you will need [Save Unbaker](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85565?tab=description) for the beds to be in the correct positions. Both files are ESL Flagged.
