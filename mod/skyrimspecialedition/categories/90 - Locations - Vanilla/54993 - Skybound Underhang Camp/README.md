This mod is an expansion of the [Skybound Underhang](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Bandit_Camp:_Skybound_Underhang)﻿ unmarked location, southeast of Riverwood. There really isn't much in that area in vanilla, other than a chest and two bandits. Wanted to finally give the creation kit a shot, and remembered this area when thinking of what to do. Expands the area with a couple of easter eggs sprinkled in. Adds about 7 more bandits to the area, including a bandit boss. A shack where the bandits have kept some food, an area for the camp's mage to do his work in. A balcony with a couple bandits that keeps an eye on the road, and a bunch of other small things to make the area even more interesting. The bandits shouldn't attack you if you're passing by on the road, but will attack if you enter their camp. (Mod is esl flagged)
  
  
Works with Missives by default. You can get quests from the missives board that will take you to Skybound Underhang Camp
