The pilgrimage of the 7000 steps is a journey most likely experienced within the first few hours of playtime. In the vanilla game, while you can meet other travellers, the pathway seems exceedingly dangerous with multiple hostile encounters interspersed. This mod aims to make the 7000 steps a more peaceful and atmospheric pilgrimage. All hostile encounters except for the troll have been swapped for ambient wildlife, 'fixing' a logic oversight where the other travellers in close proximity should have also encountered hostiles. The troll encounter has been spruced up with environmental storytelling, where an unfortunate pilgrim has met his demise attempting to take shelter from the storm. This area has also received a map marker to provide an additional fast travel point between Ivarstead and High Hrothgar. Varying trees and vegetation have been converted into low-growth flora at higher altitudes, representative of the harsh mountainous climate. The High Hrothgar map marker has also been aligned with the temple itself, whereas the vanilla game has it placed asymmetrical to the entrance.

This should be highly compatible with all other mods. Does not edit navmesh. Other mods which change the level-design along the 7000 steps may conflict.
