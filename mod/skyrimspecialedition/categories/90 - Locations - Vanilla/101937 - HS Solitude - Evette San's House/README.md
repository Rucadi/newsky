﻿ **- Description -**

[/font]**Evette San's House** is the house of Evette San in [Solitude﻿](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/search/?BH=0&RH_ModList=nav:false,home:false,type:0,user_id:0,game_id:1704,advfilt:true,search%5Bfilename%5D:HS%20Solitude,search%5Bauthor%5D:Hylios%20Sykes,include_adult:true,page_size:20,show_game_filter:false,open:true,sort_by:OLD_u_downloads). It is located between Jala's House and Addvar's House across the street from [Proudspire Manor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72313). Evette is the local wine merchant, she lives alone with her father Octieve who has fallen into alcoholism and gambling after retiring. Evette can be found most of the time selling her spiced wine; a family recipe; in the market while her father is not always far from the tavern making a ruckus while getting drunk.

﻿ **- Installation -**

[/font]- Make sure your version of [HS Resources](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72307) is up to date, if not, download and install the latest release, this is a mandatory requirement and you might be missing some items if you're using an outdated version. Make sure to track the mod as well so you get notified of any update.
  
- Use a mod manager software such as [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/1)﻿, install, enable the mod and *voilà!*
  
- **Or** drop the content of the archive into your "Skyrim Special Edition\Data" folder
  
  
The Loot auto-sort should take care of the rest, but if I'm a bit behind in committing the rules for the newly released mods or if you want to mess around your Load Order on your own it is recommended to load this mod fairly late in the LO to prevent any other mods to mess with visual elements of the cell, patches might be required in some cases but I will not be making them myself unless I'm personally using the mod.
  
  
**Add-ons included in the optional files :**
  
  
- A Compatibility patch disabling ELFX changes made to the cell edited by this mod.
  
- A Compatibility patch disabling LUX changes made to the cell edited by this mod.

﻿ **- Compatibility -**

[/font]I will list bellow some of the mods that have been reported as incompatible and requiring patching, I will not be making any patches myself, this list will only serve as a remainder for those of you that actually read the description before whining in the comment section, but let's face it, nobody does, and I don't even know why I'm writing this, thank god for copy / paste.

﻿ **- Disclaimer -**

[/font]The mod as well as the patches are ESL flagged. I will not be releasing variants or All-In-One versions of these mods since that will go against the "modular" philosophy behind them, letting you pick and choose which location you want to install and having multiple version of the same thing would quickly make this a nightmare to maintain.
