Mod Description

Valthiem Towers is a small bandit camp built around the ruins of a small Nordic ruin on the road east of Whiterun.
  
  
This location is a strategic control point used by a group of bandits to collect gold from those traveling the roads. The original concept of the location from my understanding using the ruins and CellID information was that this was supposed to be an ancient Nordic keep. I reinvigorated the location by expanding on the fortification of the keep, adding a brand-new interior cell, and adding some immersive cluttering and set pieces to make the location feel lived in and occupied by the bandits,
