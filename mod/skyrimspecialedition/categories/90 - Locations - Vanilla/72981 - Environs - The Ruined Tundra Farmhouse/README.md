This mod makes edits to the destroyed farmhouse between the Western Watchtower and Fort Greymoor near Whiterun. It applies dynamic changes to the location which evolve over time through a playthrough. This is simply an immersion mod with the goal of making the world space of Skyrim feel a bit more alive. It is designed to be as lightweight, compatible, and fit with the base game as well as possible.
  
  
  
*\*\*\* This mod requires the latest Environs Master Plugin, found [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/91160).
  
\*\*\* Ok to install mid-game.
  
\*\*\* Do NOT update from any version earlier than v3.00.*

Skyrim's world space tends to feel very static. Despite a civil war, dragons, and vampires, not much ever changes. The Environs series implements small, dynamic changes that take place over time to help make the land of Skyrim feel more alive, to help give a sense that events are occurring and time was passing throughout a playthrough.

When you start the game the farmhouse will be intact, and there will be two elderly NPCs who live there.
  
  
The farmhouse will be destroyed later as you progress through the game (destroyed by the dragon at the Western Watchtower if you choose the Default file). After some time has passed, a new NPC will arrive, clear the debris, and begin making repairs. Two gravestones will also appear on the hill behind the house. It's hinted that this NPC is the son of the elderly couple who perished.
  
  
Eventually the farm will be fully rebuilt and the NPC will settle down to live there, joined by a wife and child. All NPCs have full AI packages and several re-used vanilla voice lines to give them more life. One NPC will even visit Whiterun's market occasionally.
  
  
The destruction of the farmhouse is designed to reflect impact of the dragons' arrival in Skyrim, and so is implemented after a certain stage of the Main Quest, but alternative triggers are also available. After this, the farm will remain in ruins for some time before the next stages are enabled. Each subsequent stage is enabled after a certain amount of time has passed in game (each stage has a requirement for the number of in-game days passed). It will take at least **10 days** for the new NPC to arrive and begin rebuilding the house. The next stages will advance after 25 days each. The goal is to make the sequence take place gradually through a playthrough, to make it feel as though things are changing in the world with the passage of time. 
  
  
  
~ STAGES ~
  
  
**Initial State**:  Farmhouse intact, with two elderly residents
  
**Destroyed State**:  (Vanilla): Farmhouse destroyed during 'Dragon Rising'
  
**Rebuilding Start State**:  Rubble removed, new NPC arrives to begin rebuilding.
  
**Partial Rebuilt State**:  Rebuilding progress made
  
**Final State**: Farm fully rebuilt, family settled
  
  
  
  
~ FILE OPTONS ~
  
  
**Default** - Farmhouse is destroyed after the dragon attack at the Western Watchtower.
  
**Way of the Voice**- Farmhouse is destroyed after reaching the Greybeards in High Hrothgar.
  
**Timed Destruction**- No reference at all to the Main Quest. Shack is destroyed after 40 in-game days.
  
**Vigilant**- Compatible with VIGILANT by Vicn. Farmhouse destroyed as part of a quest during the first act.
  
  
(These alternate versions are useful if you have a mod like Skyrim Unbound, which disables the first part of the Main Quest, or if you simply prefer a their approach. The Vigilant version fits nicely with its quest's narrative, in my opinion).
  
  
  
Generally, this mod is designed to be as compatible and lightweight as possible:
  
  
- no navmesh changes
  
- no landscape height changes
  
- no invisible spells or scripts running in the background constantly
  
- does not touch vanilla quest records
  
- does not touch any vanilla NPCs
  
- does not touch any vanilla interiors
  
- touches very few vanilla records in general.
  
- cleaned and checked for errors in xEdit
  
  
If you notice file conflicts with my other mods, don't worry. They're simply sharing the same identical scripts, which were designed to be reused. There's no issue and load order won't matter.

Should be compatible with almost everything, except mods that change the same location.

This mod works by placing several invisible checkpoints in the world which use a simple script to check if the quest and level requirements have been met, and enables the correct stage once true. These checkpoints are placed just outside the gates of each major city in Skyrim (Whiterun, Solitude, Markarth, Windhelm, and Riften), areas most people will pass through occasionally. This is a way to ensure each stage is triggered off screen, and is relatively simple and non-bloaty, as there are no constantly running scripts. It should allow the sequence of stages to occur naturally over your playthrough.
  
  
If Aevar dies before or during the rebuilding of the farmhouse, the progress will stop and never finish (A bit more immersion this way. His stats have been slightly boosted so hopefully he's not killed too easily.)
