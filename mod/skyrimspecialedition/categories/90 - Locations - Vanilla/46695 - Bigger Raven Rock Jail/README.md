**Description**
  
  
As I found it silly that the Raven Bulwark Jail only had one cell, I decided to make the interior of the jail of Raven Rock Bulwark bigger and add more cells and prisoners.

No known incompatible mods.
  
  
**FAQ**
  
  
Q: Why did you release all these tweaks seperate? Can't you just put them in a pack?
  
A: They used to be in a pack called Andrealphus' Gameplay Tweaks. (which is now named [Andrealphus' Tweaks - Harder Quests](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27939))
  
  
However, since the title wasn't descriptive enough, many people were having issues finding a particular tweak. That mod was just a bag of random things, because I never really thought about packaging it up for the public.
  
  
I was just playing around with it, releasing them as I made them. However, I want to make all of the tweaks to be easier to find by the public, and as such decided to seperate them and give them better descriptive names.
  
  
For instance, if someone was looking for a mod to feed rabbits, they couldn't find the tweak that I made, since it was part of "Andrealphus Gameplay Tweaks". However, now I hope it's easier to find them. My apologies for any inconvenience.
  
  
Q: ESPFE?
  
A: Yes.
  
  
Q: Does installing/updating/uninstalling on an existing save work?
  
A: As far as I know, it should. However, it's good practice to keep a backup save prior to doing this, just in case.
  
  
Q: Is this compatible with <insert mod>?
  
A: I don't know by heart. You might need to check yourself.
  
  
Q: Will you make a patch for <insert mod>?
  
A: Only if it's a mod I use myself or plan on using, I have enough time and I actually like the idea. Otherwise, feel free to do it yourself. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: I have a suggestion to improve the mod. Can you do it?
  
A: Maybe, if I have time and I like the idea, I'll consider it.
  
  
Q: Will you port this to <insert platform>?
  
A: No, I myself only support the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If someone else wants to port it, feel free. (see permission) If you decide to port it, you yourself take full responsibility to offer support to said port. I will not provide no support for any ports by third parties.
  
  
Q: I use a ported version of this mod on <insert platform> and I have a problem. Can you help?
  
A: I don't provide any support for third party ports on other platforms than the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If you have issues, you should adress the person that ported it.
  
  
Q: Does this work on Skyrim 1.6+, aka "Anniversary Edition"?
  
A: Yes, it should.
  
  
Q: Why don't your mods use MCMs and instead use this janky console command system to set globals?
  
A: I am not a fan of MCMs. You can set the globals by making a patch in xEdit. I have no plans of changing this. If you want to add an MCM, feel free. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: Why don't you use FOMODs?
  
A: That would require reuploading the entire mod, in question, even if I only make a small change. My internet is limited and reuploading the files each time will take a huge chunk of my monthly volume.
