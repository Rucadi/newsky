# Cultured Orc Furniture

**/Concept**
  
  
I've been amazed by [Kelretu ressources](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/82985) that I integrated his work seamlessly with vanilla content to add more depth in orcish furniture. 
  
Nothing is added, **I just replaced some vanilla furniture** with his custom models when needed. Might be a detail for some people, but for other this mod can be a real boost in vanilla immersion.
  
  
Reminder : an orcish furniture set already exists in vanilla, this mod bring just more novelty and diversity to it. Nothing fancy.
  
  
  
**[size=3]/Infos**
  
  
- No navmesh edits
  
- Flagged ESL
  
- Middle class furniture replacement are manly in longhouses
  
- Almost every chests, and 70% of static barrels replaced
  
- Some strongholds have a custom blacksmith forge and Dushnikh Yal a distinct orcish well
  
- Kelretu's custom models use vanilla textures, all texture replacer will be compatible out the box
  
- No [Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805) version provided for the moment, for clipping, scale and position tweaking reason
  
- Patch for [Spice Of Life](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22178) made by [agentw](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/19019539?tab=user+files) available
  
- By its design, this little mod should be highly compatible I guess
  
- However, some mods like Ember XD will not apply on the new orc Forge, it will need 3D work to patch
  
- [Animated Forge Water](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52322?tab=files) doesn't apply to the new orc forge, it need a patch[/size]
