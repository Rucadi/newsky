[color=#6d9eeb]What is it? Dragons?
  
-----------------------
  
No, this mod gives the Solitude Arch a more credible look. It [/color]is a rework of [Realistic Solitude Arch SE - Proper Port](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25122) made by cyde042 which itself is based upon an old mod by EagleBirdman.
  
  
EB's mod was hidden on Nexus when I released my mod in April 2024. However, as of Sept. 2025 [EB's mod is available again](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7823). cyde's update of EB's mod took care of the technical issues, among other things. But the mod plugins are normal .esp's and count towards the plugin limit. This is especially "expensive" in case one also wants to use the [Solitude Docks Updated](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33777) mod since this setup occupies two full .esp slots with the cyde042 plugins.
  
  
I have simplified the files and streamlined the setup to make the mod more user friendly:
  
  
The vanilla version is now compacted and ESL-flagged in SSEEdit. Otherwise this file is totally identical to the plugin that cyde042 provides.
  
  
The version for Solitude Docks is a bit more elaborate in that it unifies the changes from the vanilla plugin and cyde's SD patch into one single plugin. This version is now standalone and also ESL-flagged. In addition, I cleaned out three superfluous master .esm files that were in cyde's plugins.
  
  
The benefit is that now, you need only one ESL-flagged plugin to obtain a better Solitude Arch instead of one or even two full .esp plugins. So judge for yourself which of the three "Realistic Arch" mods you prefer. I dare say my version is the technically most up-to-date.
  
  
All artistic credit must go to cyde042! In case you like my mod and endorse it, please also download and endorse [cyde042's original mod](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25122) because all I did were some technical changes and without cyde042 we would still be stuck with the underwhelming, fragile vanilla arch. So big Thanks to [cyde042](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/cyde042/about-me)!
  
  
  
Installation
  
-------------
  
This small mod is safe to install mid-game. Install with the mod manager of your choice.
  
  
You can choose between 4 different downloads. The main choice is whether you want pre-generated LOD's included or not (see Limitations), and whether you use the mod Solitude Docks Updated or not. Please go by the file names, they should be self-explanatory. **Please read the Limitations below.** It may help you selecting the proper version for your purposes.
  
  
If you will generate your own LOD's with DynDOLOD (or xLODGen only) -> install one of the Main files without LOD.
  
If you are happy with simple, pre-generated LOD's -> install one of the Optionals.
  
In any case, you only need to install one version. All downloads contain everything.
  
  
*Sidenote: the Solitude Docks version actually also works when Solitude Docks is not installed; SD is not a master to my mod. However without SD, the non-SD version looks better in-game. So I do recommend to pick the non-SD version for a non-SD setup.*
  
  
  
Deinstallation
  
----------------
  
This mod is safe to be uninstalled mid-game. All it does is adding and editing a bunch of rocks. There are no scripts or otherwise potentially harmful content that will break your savegame after uninstalling.
  
  
  
Limitations - a bit of background
  
--------------------------------------
  
For the Skyrim game engine to correctly display environmental structures (e.g. this mod, trees, plants, ruins, ships, cities etc.) at a distance beyond the immediate vicinity around the player, all such objects need to have so-called "LOD (Level of Detail) files" for proper visuals. Thus, **the Main File version, which deliberately do es not include LOD's when viewed from afar, will still show the base game arch shape and not the "Realtistic" one!**
  
  
This issue is not particular to this mod but rather the normal, expected in-game behaviour. Now, of course as a player/user we want correct visuals also from a distance, so we need to have proper LOD's. There are three LOD options available to the mod user: simple, imtermediate and best.
  
  
Simple and quick but prone to (visual) conflict with other mods, under "Optional Files" I have included 2 versions with pre-generated LOD files. These are vanilla game LOD's. While the visuals from a distance are definitely much better than without any LOD's, it is not fully satisfactory. Depending from where you look and which way you approach, you may still see some gaps and eventual fade-ins.
  
  
More importantly, these LOD's may get overwritten by LOD files from any other (Solitude area) mods that you may have installed. For example, together with Drengin's Blue Palace Terrace, there is a visual conflict: Either you have correct BPT distance visuals or correct RSA visuals. In this case you will have to pick the load order that you feel is the lesser evil. Legacy of the Dragonborn is another potential visual conflict, but I have not tested that.
  
  
The intermediate solution is to run [xLODGen](https://stepmodifications.org/forum/topic/13451-xlodgen-terrain-lod-beta-110-for-fnv-fo3-fo4-fo4vr-tes5-sse-tes5vr-enderal-enderalse/) for "Objects" for your modlist. This runs in minutes and easily resolves all LOD conflicts because the process custom-generates LOD's for all relevant mods your individual game. Do install my Main file version for this use case. xLODGen64 can absolutely be used as standalone. In fact, this is how I created the LOD's for the Optionals (on an unmodded vanilla game). This option offers a good compromise between required effort, time to generate and resulting visuals.
  
  
The visually best, most comprehensive option is to run [DynDOLOD](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68518) for your modlist. It is a multi-step workflow that takes time and a bit of learning. But to the hesitant user I will say that even a DynDOLOD setup with only moderate settings is visually much superior to anything the vanilla game and (my) pre-generated LOD can produce.
