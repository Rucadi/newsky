**DESCRIPTION**
  
  
The Skyforge is the best forge in all of Skyrim. It is impressive to look at, and the view from it is also impressive. However, it does seem inadequate in some areas. The obvious one is that it doesn't have a complete set of crafting stations. The less obvious ones are that the forge doesn't have any storage, a blacksmith sign, or seats for Eorlund Gray-Mane or the customers. Where does Eorlund Gray-Mane keep his raw materials and finished goods? Most forges are next to the blacksmith's house, and the blacksmiths can just go inside whenever they need to get or put away things. The Skyforge, however, is far from any building. Skyforge Complete completes the Skyforge by adding the missing blacksmith crafting stations, storage, seating, and a blacksmith sign. The differences between this mod and the dozens of other mods like it are that the stations are placed at practical locations, they don't interfere with any markers, they are placed where Eorlund Gray-Mane will actually use them, and they are placed at highly compatible locations. It is lightweight and lore-friendly, and it maintains the clean and open look of the vanilla Skyforge. It doesn't alter any navmesh and won't break any quest. One of the added crates can be use for storage. The other can be use to toggle the blacksmith sign or the bench area for improve compatibility. Toggling is done by activating the diamond shape studs on the crate by the stairs. Two crates and a barrel may not seem like a lot of storage, but it makes the Skyforge look more believable. Space at the Skyforge is limited, and just about every mod that alters Whiterun wants to add something there. Rather than clutter up the Skyforge and create compatibility issues, this mod takes a minimalistic approach. This allows the mod to be use with other mods that add storage and clutter to the Skyforge. All options are esl flagged and will not take up any of the 254 esm/esp slots. This is a clean and stable mod that can be added or removed at anytime.
  
  
There are multiple options for JK's Skyrim and JK's Whiterun. JK's version of the Skyforge, while great, was missing the great view from the Skyforge. The NW (No Wall) options remove the wall, add the storage crate, and reposition the grindstone and tanning rack. The JK versions of Skyforge Complete remove the surrounding wall and structures, add the storage crate, and reposition the crafting stations the way Skyforge Complete positions them. All options are esl flagged and can be added or removed at anytime.
  
  
The Capital Whiterun Expansion option adds the new options, a storage crate, relocates the bench and workbench, and fixes the broken NavMesh at the Skyforge. The reason for relocating the workbench was to put it in range of Eorlund Gray-Mane's AI package so that he will actually use it. It has been tested with both the Normal and Exterior Compatibility versions. It is a light plugins (ESPFE/esl flagged) and can be added or removed at anytime.
  
  
The Open cities option adds the new options, the missing tanning rack and a storage crate. It is a light plugins (ESPFE/esl flagged) and can be added or removed at anytime.
  
  
The SkyforgeJK option just adds crates, seats, a sign, and clutter to JK's Skyforge. This version doesn't move or remove anything from Jk's Skyforge. It can be use with either Jk's Skyrim or Jk's Whiterun.
  
  
The SkyforgeSAS (Sign And Seating) option just adds a crate,  a bench, a sign,  and clutter to the Skyforge. It doesn't move or remove anything from the Skyforge. This version can be use with most other Whiterun overhauls and even other Skyforge overhauls.
  
  
The SkyforgeCompleteEC version will work for either SR Exterior Cities Series All In One or SR Exterior Cities Series Whiterun and must load after them.
  
  
The SkyforgeSC version removes the bench, smelter, storage crate, and workbench from SkyforgeComplete to allow it to work with Spaghetti's Cities - AIO or Spaghetti's Cities - Whiterun. The main benefit of using this mod over SkyforgeSAS is the addition of the tanning rack which isn't included in Spaghetti's Cities. It is standalone and doesn't actually require Spaghetti's Cities. It may work with other overhauls as well. It only needs to load after any mod that that edits the grindstone.
  
  
Whichever Whiterun or Skyforge mod you are using, Skyforge Complete will make it better.

**INSTALLATION AND USAGE**
  
  
Choose the appropriate version for your mod list. Use only one plugin. Add the contents of archive to the Data directory manually or with a mod manager. Make a clean save before enabling the mod if you are adding the mod midplaythrough. Sort you load order. Skyforge Complete should load after any mod that edits the grindstone. Enable the mod and play. **Toggle off the bench area or blacksmith sign with the Make Change activators on the crate by the grindstone if needed**. The JK's Skyrim versions requires JK's Skyrim and should load after it. The JK's Whiterun versions requires JK's Whiterun and should load after it. The main version does not require JK's Skyrim or JK's Whiterun and is not compatible with them. If you are using Dawn of Skyrim  without JK's Skyrim, load the [This Is Jorrvaskr - DOS](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34276?tab=files) patch after DOS and then load Skyforge Complete. If you are using JK's Skyrim and Dawn of Skyrim together, load the JK's Skyrim - Dawn of Skyrim - Patch and then load one of the  JK's Skyrim options. The JK's Whiterun versions have not been extensively tested, but should work fine. The Capital Whiterun Expansion option requires Capital Whiterun Expansion and must load after it. The Open Cities option requires Open Cities to be useful, but is not dependent on it. It should load before Open Cities. The SkyforgeCompleteEC version will work for either SR Exterior Cities Series All In One or SR Exterior Cities Series Whiterun and must load after them. The SkyforgeSC version will work for either Spaghetti's Cities - AIO or Spaghetti's Cities - Whiterun. All plugins are esl flagged and will not take up any of the 254 esm/esp slots. They can be added or removed at anytime.

**NOTES**
  
**Click the spoiler tag and read what's below if you're having issues or just want to be smarter. Most of your questions related to the mod will be answered here.**
  
  
Spoiler
  
This mod moves the grindstone in order to better locate the tanning rack. If the grindstone isn't moved, you likely have the wrong load order or the grindstone is not the vanilla grindstone and can't be moved by this mod. Also check to see if you are using the correct version of the plugin and patches.
  
  
SkyforgeCompleteJKS or SkyforgeCompleteJKW can be loaded after any patch for Whiterun Has Walls Redone and JK's Skyrim or JK's Whiterun to remove the tower at the Skyforge.
  
  
If you are using JKs Skyrim and Dawn of Skyrim together with the JK's Skyrim - Dawn of Skyrim - Patch, use any of the JKs Skyrim options instead of SkyforgeComplete and This Is Jorrvaskr - DOS.
  
  
If you are using JKs Skyrim and Capital Whiterun Expansion together with JK Whiterun Expansion Patch.esp, there is no compatible option for this combination.
  
  
If you are using JK's Skyrim or Jk's Whiterun and Whiterun Has Walls Redone together and are using Base Object Swapper, you MUST choose the BOS version of Whiterun Has Walls Redone. While either version of Whiterun Has Walls Redone will work correctly with BOS installed, the patches won't and will result in floating objects and invisible walls at the Skyforge. If you choose the non-BOS version, the patches will only work correctly if BOS is not installed.
  
  
If you see low resolution LODs overlapping with the ground or with other structures, it is caused the LODs not unloading. This can sometimes happen when fast travelling or changing to an exterior cell. To get rid of it, make a save, exit the game, restart the game, then load the save. This bug can be prevented by using LOD Unloading Bug Fix.
  
  
Skyrim has a bug in which stores remain closed or the merchants tell you to leave even during business hours. Waiting in front of the store will not fix this. What does work is leaving the area for three days until the cell resets. What appears to be happening is that the merchants are stuck in the wrong AI package. NPC AI Process Position Fix may help prevent this issue. While the Skyforge isn't an interior shop, this bug can cause Eorlund Gray-Mane to be stuck inside his house. Bad or broken NavMeshes can also prevent him from making his way to the Skyforge.
  
  
If you encounter the missing or disappearing dialogue bug, such as when a merchant won't offer you the selling dialogue or a hireling won't offer the hiring dialogue, it's likely that you are using more mods than the Skyrim engine can handle. This bug can also affect quest dialogues, making it impossible to continue a quest. This issue does not appear to be limited to only dialogue mods. It can occur even if you aren't using any dialogue related mods. If you make a save, then exit the game, and then load the save, the dialogue may temporarily show up. Reordering your load order or removing mods may also cause it to temporarily show up. These are not proper nor permanent solutions and won't work with some missing dialogues. The solution that will work is to use SSE Engine Fixes. It is one of the mods that are truly must have if you have a large mod list. Also be aware that objects can also temporarily disappear if using a large mod list without SSE Engine Fixes. These missing objects can mislead users into thinking that it is a compatibility or occlusion issue.
  
  
Whenever certain cells are edited in the Creation Kit, dirty landscape edits will automatically get inserted. The Skyforge cell is one of those cells, and the dirty landscape edit needs to be manually clean with SSEEdit each time edits are made to the Skyforge. Most of the time these dirty landscapes won't cause any issue, but they should still be cleaned. This is something for mod authors to be aware of as even mods like Immersive Citizens has these dirty edits.
  
  
This mod has been tested with MO2 and Vortex and works without issue. If you are having issues, here are some things you can check. First check that Steam and Skyrim are not installed in the "Program Files" or "Program Files (x86)" directories. If you are not very computer-literate, you shouldn't install any apps in those directories. Check that vortex is allowed to change the  filetime on the vanilla BSA files. Filetimes on vanilla BSA files can cause loose files in mods to not load. Check that the archive isn't corrupt. Use 7-Zip to test the archive. If it's bad, it needs to be downloaded again. If it's good, try reinstalling it. Check that the load order is correct. Read the INSTALLATION AND USAGE section of the Description page for load order guidance. Do not solely rely on automatic sorting. Check that you are only using one version of the same mod.
  
  
When asking for troubleshooting help or reporting bugs, explain what the issue is, the steps you used to install the mod, and what you have tried to fix it. Post a picture if you aren't good at describing issues with words. If needed, post your plugin modlist in its correct mod order and your archives modlist in its correct mod order using spoiler tags. These information will help to identify compatibility issues, bugs, and incorrect load or installation orders. It will also help to identify or eliminate user error as the problem. Sometimes, including the mod, patch, or game versions can help to identify incompatible or mismatched versions. Understand that when it comes to troubleshooting mods, no one will be able to help you if you don't provide the necessary information.
  
  
There are a lot of confusion about esl, plugin limits, and Skyrim AE/SE. So here is a brief summary.
  
There are a total of 256 slots in Skyrim SE. This is the case with Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim LE as well. Of the 256 slots, one is reserved for game use. This leaves 255 slots for esm/esp/esl files. 255 is the esm/esp plugin limit, not the mod limit. Some mods do not take up any slots. The five official masters are part of the game and shouldn't be consider mods. Therefore, the esm/esp mod limit is actually 250. It has often been stated that esl and esl flagged esp files do not take up a slot. That is inaccurate. Using one or more esl or esl flagged esp file will require one slot and reduce the 255 esm/esp slot limit to 254. The total number of plugin slots is still 255. While esl and esl flagged plugins require one slot, they will not take up more than one slot regardless of how many of them is used. There is, however, a 4096 light plugin limit in Skyrim v1.6 and newer and a limit of 2048 for older versions of Skyrim SE. Skyrim SE is a 64-bit remastered version of Skyrim LE. Skyrim AE is the anniversary edition of Skyrim SE. Skyrim AE is still Skyrim SE. Skyrim AE comes in two versions, the free AE update and the retail/paid/full AE bundle version. Free AE and full AE are both Skyrim AE with the only difference being the 70+ additional creations. Skyrim v1.6.1130 and newer uses the 1.71 plugin header which allows light plugins to have up to 4096 new records. The older 1.70 plugin header limited light plugins to 2048 new records. Versions of Skyrim older than v1.6.1130 will not work with any plugin that uses the 1.71 plugin header without the use of the Backported Extended ESL Support mod. To use the Creations Kit with mods using the 1.71 plugin header, Creation Kit v1.6.1130.0 or newer is needed.
