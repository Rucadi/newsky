The inn reopens when Fort Dunstad is occupied by a garrison -- clients and decor match the current fort ownership.
  
Not that *another* inn was sorely needed, it's just for immersion.
  
No posh interiors or lustful wenches -- well, not too lustful -- but they do serve the best cheese.Spoiler
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
**Must be loaded after mods that edit the same cell.**
  
I'm aware of *"Medieval Lanterns of Skyrim"*, *"Relighting Skyrim"*, and *"Remove Interior Fog"*.
  
  
  
  
  
**Patches**
  
  
"**Rigmor of Bruma**" -- the restored inn is accessible only after having completed the "Enemy of my Enemy" quest.
  
I also took the liberty of adjusting a conversation scene which is supposed to run after the fight inside the inn -- it looked like that sometimes it might have been skipped.
  
The patch in the installer is for the new "Reboot" version but in the miscellaneous files I uploaded the old patch for the "Legacy" version, just in case.
  
  
"**Enhanced Lights and FX**"
  
  
"**Sounds of Skyrim Complete SE**"
