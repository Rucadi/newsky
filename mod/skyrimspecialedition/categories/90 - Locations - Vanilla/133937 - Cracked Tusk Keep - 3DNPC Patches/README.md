3DNPC Patches for Schlitzohr's Cracked Tusk Keep or Orc Exiles Cracked Tusk Keep.With Orc Exiles Landscape tweaks.
  
  
As I haven't play through 3DNPC's scene here,I could only make visual patch.There might be something wrong in story-telling.
  
  
For Schlitzohr's Cracked Tusk Keep,I disabled Sch's Tower and adjust positions of tarvern(?) clutters and marker in this tower(seems like Sch's use this power as a tarvern) into 3DNPC's Tower,but its might seem strange as the Tower has a tarvern and 3DNPC scene together.Tweaked navmesh.
  
  
For Orc Exiles,I moved 3DNPC's Tower to a nearby position,redone nearby navmesh.Patched navmesh to enable door maker of 3DNPC's cave.Then,I tweaked a tanning rack's position as it's partly underground.That's all.
  
  
I also provide a patch which reduce grass around Orc Exiles's buildings and roads,but it's not hard requirement.By the way,Orc Exiles Cracked Tusk do not need navmesh tweaks and as there's a efps patch,tweaking or adding original occlusion is not good for compatibility.
