[left][/left][left][/left][left]**About**
  
  
A mod based on waterfalls section from Cooleoj’s *[Unique Locations - Riverwood Forest](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9258)﻿*. It takes the main waterfall and the smaller one near Riverwood as standalone mod, added some extra stuff around them, a new fresh experience when walking around Riverwood, making exploration feel different with subtle changes that add variety to the area.

*[i]\*You can request or create your own patch without my permission*
  
[/i]*\*It may be incompatible with mods that edit landscapes around the affected cells**\*Load unpatched mods after my mod, if you notice any bugs you can report them here, and I might create the patch.*
  
**Optional Files**
  
There's three optional add-ons in mod installation:
  
  

  
* Riverwood Treeless Path: Significantly reduce number of roadside trees from Guardian Stones to Riverwood, re-running DynDOLOD is recommended
Northern Roads clutter: This is a standalone plugin with no dependencies you don’t need Northern Roads to use it. However, if you have Northern Roads installed, there is an option to use its texture and mesh folders to save some space.
  
* Remove Fogs: Removes two fog effects, one covering Bleakfalls Barrow and another near Riverwood to make the spring waterfall view clear, load after weather mods.

  
**LOD**I provide pre-generated Terrain LOD in the FOMOD. However, if you already have XLODGen output and don’t want to re-run it, you can download the optional file and let mine override your output. This may cause texture or height mismatches since my LOD is generated using vanilla textures. Note that I don’t provide object or tree LOD you still need DynDOLOD for that.
