It always seemed a bit of a shame that certain houses in Skyrim are left abandoned and unused after their associated quests. This little immersion mod adds new NPC residents and small changes to each interior after their quests.
  
  
These NPCs are relatively inconsequential but should help Skyrim’s cities feel more dynamic and interesting. Most of them are just ambient NPCs, but one of them comes with a basic fetch quest and another will set up a shop in Morthal. Each NPC has carefully spliced voice lines, and they can be found around town working, and visiting shops, temples, and taverns, etc. When they arrive, the clutter and furniture in each interior will change to reflect the new ownership. The name of each house will also change. This mod affects 7 interior locations and adds 14 new NPCs in total.
  
  
Changes will not take place immediately. It will take at least 15 days to pass before a location is changed after its associated quest. This is intended to make the changes feel more gradual and organic, rather than an immediate consequence of the quest. There are invisible checkpoints inside that gates or on the main road through each city that check the requirements and enable these changes.
  
  
  
*[size=2]\*\*\* Installing mid-game is not recommended. Doing so may cause minor issues; [Save Unbaker](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85565)may help.**\*\*\* If you notice conflicting files with other Environs mods, it's no issue as the files are identical. Load order won't matter.

Skyrim's world space tends to feel very static. Despite a civil war, dragon attacks, and a rising vampire menace, not much ever changes. If the player could notice visible changes taking place over time it would help make the land of Skyrim feel more alive. It would help give a sense that events were occurring and time was passing throughout a playthrough. Ideally, these changes should be as seamless as possible with the base game. This mod attempts to implement this idea to at a handful of locations.
  
  
  
  
[/size]![](https://imgur.com/q7RaBTY.png)**Nepos House, Markarth** 
  
After “No One Escapes Cidnah Mine,” a Nord family will move in, including one child and a Bosmer housekeeper. This requires the quest to be complete and Nepos to be dead. This building will become "Rorygg and Helfhild's House."
  
  
**Abandoned House, Markarth**
  
After “House of Horrors” a new NPC will take up residence here. Something seems a little strange about him, though… This building will become "Mordyval's House."
  
  
**Alva's House, Morthal**
  
Once “Laid to Rest” is complete, a Nord woman will move into Alva's House with Hroggar. She’ll become his new wife (Hroggar probably deserves some happiness after all that's happened). She will also turn this house into a small store; she'll still do this even if Hroggar is dead. Morthal will now finally have a general merchant. Before this happens, she can be found living in Stonehills. The name of the new shop will be “The Lair’s Wares.”
  
  
**Calixto’s House of Curiosities, Windhelm**
  
After “Blood on Ice” a Nord family will move into Calixto’s House, including two kids. (Seriously, why are there no children in Windhelm besides the orphan girl?). This building will be renamed "Raven-Hand Residence."
  
  
**Riftweald Manor, Riften**
  
An Imperial couple moves in after you beat the Thieves Guild quest line. This building will become the "Aeditus' Residence.” (I also had to block the back doors because an NPC kept getting stuck)
  
  
**Silus Vesuius's House (Dawnstar Museum)**
  
If Silus dies for any reason an Altmer NPC will move into the Dawnstar Museum (typically you can kill him during “Pieces of the Past”). She is a Dwemer researcher, and comes with a very basic fetch quest. If you complete this quest and return later on her Dwemer spider will be reactivated (it's non-hostile and doesn't actually do anything). This building will become "Arenwe's House."
  
  
**Beitild’s House, Dawnstar**
  
A Dunmer miner will move into Beitild’s House if she dies for any reason. This includes (but isn’t limited to) the Dark Brotherhood side contract for her. This building becomes "Relyn’s House” afterward.
  
  
  
Several NPCs will occasionally visit the Temple of Talos in Windhelm or the Shrine of Talos in Markarth, but only conditionally if the city is controlled by the Stormcloaks, a small detail that pairs nicely with my [Shrines of Talos mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85141). This mod implements over 170 voice lines (including a handful of conditional lines), not bad for a totally inconsequential immersion mod!

Built-in compatibility with many city overhauls.

No edits to vanilla NPCs.
  
  
Interior changes are mainly furniture and clutter, carefully placed to work within the vanilla layout of each interior. These changes are relatively non-intrusive, but patches may be needed for mods that affect the same cells. 
  
  
Adds a handful of objects and idle markers to exterior spaces; these have been placed with compatibility in mind for popular city overhauls.
  
  
Changes from the Unofficial Patch have been forwarded.
