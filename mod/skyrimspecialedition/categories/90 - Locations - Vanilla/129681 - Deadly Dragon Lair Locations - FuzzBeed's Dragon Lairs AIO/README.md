FuzzBeed's Dragon Lairs
  
  
﻿For the focal point of game, dragons have very lackluster locations in Skyrim. Usually occupying a small Nordic ruin or mountain peak, with a lone word wall, these lairs don't capture the grandeur that a ferocious dragon encounter should instill. This mod hopes to rectify this issue by giving each of dragon lairs its own sense of identity and scale.
