After encountering her at Frostmere Crypt, Eisa Blackthorn will now head to Morthal and reside there permanently. Once you’ve completed the quests "The Pale Lady" and “Laid to Rest” she'll begin rebuilding the burned down house that belonged to Hroggar. Once it's rebuilt, Eisa will be recruitable as a follower. Just a small mod to give a little more life to Morthal. Enjoy!
  
  
  
*\*\*\* This mod requires the latest Environs Master Plugin, found [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/91160).
  
\*\*\* Ok to install mid-game.
  
\*\*\* Do NOT update mid-game from earlier than 2.00*

Skyrim's world space tends to feel very static. Despite a civil war, dragon attacks, and a rising vampire menace, not much ever changes. If the player could notice visible changes taking place over time it would help make the land of Skyrim feel more alive. It would help give a sense that events were occurring and time was passing throughout a playthrough. Ideally, these changes should be as seamless as possible with the base game. This mod attempts to implement this idea to small location.

Eisa can be found at the Moorside Inn in Morthal after you first meet her at the crypt. Once the two quests, “The Pale Lady” and “Laid to Rest” are complete will she begin rebuilding the burned house. 
  
  
Eisa also now has a bit of custom dialogue when you meet her again, using carefully spliced voice lines. 
  
  
Once the house is fully rebuilt you’ll be able to recruit her as a follower. Her stats and combat style are in line with vanilla followers, similar to Lydia’s. And… there's good news if you have a thing for strong warrior women: she also becomes a marriage candidate!
  
  
Once the house is built, Eisa can be found around town in various places, and will even occasionally help protect Morthal by patrolling the marsh just beyond its outskirts.
  
  
The house itself will be gradually rebuilt in several stages. To trigger the first stage of rebuilding it, you must complete both quests. After this the next stages will be triggered after a **18 days** have passed in game each. There are two invisible 'checkpoints' that fire a simple script that checks these requirements: one by the main road into Morthal, and another by the bridge in the middle of town. With this implementation there's no complex scripts, or any that need to constantly run in the background.
  
  
Note: The previous version of the mod triggered the later stages via player level requirements. The new update changes this to use a time-based check, by reading the number of in-game days passed.
  
  
**Stages**
  
1. Initial State (Vanilla)
  
2. Rebuilding Start
  
3. Partially Rebuilt 
  
4. House Complete
  
  
**Important Requirement:**
  
In order to recruit Eisa as a follower, you need a mod that adds follower dialogue for missing voice types. You can use any version [Relationship Dialogue Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1187), including the ['Lite' Version](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42068), or [Missing Follower Dialogue Edit](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56115#).
  
  
  
A bit of inspiration was obviously taken from [BUVARP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56120), so thanks to AndrealphusVIII for the great mod; I was able to learn a thing or two from it. Check that one out too.

﻿Many city overhauls are compatible, patches are available for those that aren't.
  
  
No navmesh edits.
  
  
No landscape edits.
  
  
No edits to quests.
  
  
Touches very few vanilla records in general.
  
  
Eisa's NPC record is affected; NPC overhauls may need a patch to avoid dark-face bug on her. I recommend [EasyNPC](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52313)﻿ for this.
  
  
A clone of Eisa is used by this mod to improve compatibility, similar to how BUVARP works.
