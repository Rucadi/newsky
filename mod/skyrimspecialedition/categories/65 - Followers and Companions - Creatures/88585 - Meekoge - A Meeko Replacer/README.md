**MEEKOGE (WOW)**

**OVERVIEW**

  

There are several great **Meeko** replacers out there, but none (that I've seen) on Special Edition/AE that **turn Meeko into a Shiba Inu**, so this fun little mod is here to rectify that!  If you need a lore explanation for Shiba Inu existing in Tamriel, I think they would fit in quite well as an A**kaviri breed of hunting dogs** to match the **often Asiatic influences of Akaviri culture**.

Spoiler I'm actually working on a larger creature mod that introduces Akaviri War Dogs into the game, and though they will be the larger Akita Inu breed, there will be a level of consistency with dog breeds from Akavir 
  
  

**Meekoge is a model and texture replacer for Meeko, including a Shiba Inu mesh and (as of v1.1 and up) high quality upscaled 4K textures, optimized in BC7 format for best performance.**

  
  

**COMPATIBILITY**

  

This replacer is done in as lightweight a way as possible while only changing Meeko (other dogs remain untouched, though I am considering doing a Vigilance replacer in the future), it may require a patch for anything that alters the vanilla pet hiring quest (all this mod does is add Meeko's new Shiba Inu race to the hireable dog races so that his follower functionality still works) Thus far no such issues have been reported.
  
  
Meekoge should be compatible with other mods that alter Meeko, as long as it loads after those mods.  Currently I've tested with Meeko Reborn, and loading this mod after that one changes Meeko to the Shiba Inu appearance while retaining the functions of that mod like the summoning horn. 
  
  
*Meekoge also makes Meeko essential, because my heart needs him to be.*
