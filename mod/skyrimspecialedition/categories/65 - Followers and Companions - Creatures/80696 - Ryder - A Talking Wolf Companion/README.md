**WORK IN PROGRESS -**
  
We will work on this dog more and create separate texture and voice lines for him.
  
For now he is using the base game assets (wolf texture and mesh) and voice lines (he is using an argonian male voice, funnily enough :D)
  
  
You have been warned, only install if you are OK with having this companion on this state.
  
I am aware that he is not the best dog / wolf companion out there yet. My aim is to improve it in future :)
  
  
  
  
**Ryder** 
  
- Ryder is the companion of one of our friends, Cmoneylean and we wanted to re-create his companion in Skyrim as well! :)
  
- Ryder is waiting in Whiterun in the Hall of Death, inside the catacombs.
