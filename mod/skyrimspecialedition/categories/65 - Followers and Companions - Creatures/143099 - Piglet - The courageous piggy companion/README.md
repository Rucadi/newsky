**Description**

This mod introduces a custom voiced piggy companion named Piglet to Riverwood. He can carry your belongings, wait for you, and most importantly, will follow you to oblivion and back. Although he can fight, he is not very strong, but he will do his best!
  
  
? You can equip him a backpack and a collar (you need CC Pets), you need to have the pet backpack/collar in your inventory, and a dialogue will be added to equip/unequip it
  
? Two versions one that requires CC pets (you get backpack and collar) and one that does not require CC pets (no backpack/collar)
  
? He is essential (can't die)
  
? He levels up with player
  
? Has custom voice made by me (sorry if it sucks!)
  
If he does not talk to you on your first encounter, make a save, close game, open game and load save, should work.
  
? Optional [Skyrim Party Sheet](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/167538)﻿ Portrait, see images

The piggy sometimes has an identity crisis and thinks he is a cow, so he moos, i tried to fix this through animations with OAR, but it looks like he stills moos, if you have any input/help on how to fix this please send me a DM here or in comments, i will be very grateful.
