~﻿Canine Loyalty~

  
  
After a few too many reloaded saves and google searches, I have finally decided to take it upon myself. Spriggans' animal control spell will no longer turn your lovable canine companion against you. Other animals will continue to be affected, but not dogs.
  
  
Details~
  
  
Spriggans are such a rare enemy and vanilla dogs so annoying you may have never noticed before, but spriggans have a spell that makes all nearby animals allied with them, and thus fight against the player, including any of your animal followers. Poor Meeko. When the game first launched this included dragons, but Bethesda fixed that little mistake themselves. The spell still affected dogs though, and now with this mod, dogs will be immune to spriggans' control spell.
  
  
Technically speaking I did this by adding another condition to the spell effect in the creation kit. Any actor included in the "DogFaction" will be unaffected by the spell. This includes all the vanilla dogs, including Meeko, Vigilance and the Dawnguard husky followers.
  
  
Compatability~
  
  
This mod should be compatible with most anything. The only record changed is the spriggan spell and none of my 1000+ mods had any reason to change it. If you find a mod that is incompatible let me know and I'll look into patching it, otherwise just load my mod later in your load order.
  
  
Mod Added Dogs? I haven't tested it with any dogs added by mods since I don't use any, but so long as the mod author added them to the dog faction, then it should work.
  
  
FAQ~
  
  
**ESP-FE?**
  
Yep, this mod is marked as an ESL so it won't take up a slot in your load order.
  
  
**Somebody Else Already Did This?** 
  
After 11 years I was surprised I couldn't find any mods to do this. Posts I saw asking for a mod like this only got follower frameworks as suggestions and those are too complicated for my taste. I wouldn't be surprised if somebody else had done this especially for LE, but I couldn't find it. Hopefully my mod will be easier for people to find.
  
  
**How to Install?**It's just a simple esp. Just install with a mod manager or manually drop the esp into Skyrim's data folder.
