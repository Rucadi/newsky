**Menagerie - An Anniversary Edition Pet Overhaul**

Menagerie is an overhaul of the pets added by Creations such as Saints and Seducers, Bone Wolf, and Nix-Hound, turning them into powerful allies as well as altering certain things about purchasing and interacting with them to make them more consistent. It also adds the vanilla pets such as the Volkihar Death Hounds or the Kagrumez Steadfast Automatons to the Pet Framework, allowing them to have the advanced features of the system and function similarly to their AE counterparts. This includes altering their stats, giving new names to pets lacking them, tweaking the way in which you purchase the Dwarven Mudcrab and Nix-Hound, and most importantly enabling them to fight alongside you! Now your sweet little Hilda the goat can headbutt a bandit with the best of them and your Nix-Hound can tear chunks out of a Draugr's flesh.
  
  
**Features:**
  

  
* Overhauls the stats of all CC pets to be on par with vanilla pets in terms of Health, Stamina, and speed (with the exception of Thistle the rabbit due to a lack of combat animations). Each pet now levels with the player up to at least level 30, with more powerful pets such as Chunabakch or Garmr leveling with the player up to level 50.
The Master File allows you to have up to three pets at once, as well as adding new locations to send your pets including various faction halls such as the College of Winterhold or the Dawnstar Sanctuary along with Morthal, which was for some reason missing in vanilla.
  
* Adds names to the following pets: Gwyllgi the Bonewolf, Krabrenac the Dwarven Armored Mudcrab, Asha the Nix-Hound, Pelagius and Potema the Manic and Demented Elytra Nymphs, Chunabakch the Dwarven Sphere and Sturrazak the Dwarven Spider.
Enables combat for all pets sans Thistle the rabbit. She will instead flee from combat but will return once all nearby enemies are dead.
  
* Disables the "Teleport Pet" spells. However, your pets will still follow you to the ends of the earth.
Alters the dialogue for purchasing the Dwarven Mudcrab and the Nix-Hound to be more immersive (no more text notifications!)
  
* Removes the map markers for the Pets of Skyrim quest and makes it a Miscellaneous quest while leaving the journal intact as a little hint of what to find.
Edits the messages that appear when your pet has an item ready for you to be more streamlined (i.e. "Gwyllgi found something").
  
* Each file is standalone, allowing you to mix and match based on which Creations you have. Note: Do not use the ECSS module alongside the
All edits to the main Pet Framework are included in the Master File, which is REQUIRED for all other files.
  

**Add-Ons and Patches:**
  

  
* In the Mysticism Add-On: Mysticism spells, scrolls, and staves to summon generic Bonewolves are added to leveled lists. There are two variants: The standard Bonewolf (summonable at Novice level) and the Ancient Bonewolf (summonable at Adept level).
An alternate module is available for Extended Cut - Saints and Seducers. It is incompatible with the main Saints and Seducers module, so only use one.
  
* Patches for Vigilance the Husky, Bring Meeko to Lod, and Gibberish - Currency Swapper for Skyrim Extended Cut - Saints and Seducers (requires the ECSS module) are available.

**Recommended Mods:**I highly recommend getting retextures for some of the CC pets such as those found in [Iconic's Spiders of Skyrim Retexture](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89960) for Arachne and Xavbio's [Dwemer Armor and Weapons Retexture](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93088) for Krabrenac.
