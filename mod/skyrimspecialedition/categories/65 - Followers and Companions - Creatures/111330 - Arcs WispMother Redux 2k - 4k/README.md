Arcs WispMother redux is a remesh and 4k texture overhaul for Skyrims WispMother. Improving the quality and visual style of vanillas, while also staying true to the intended look of the iconic spectral creature. This mod contains no esp, and features a high quality and glow emissive redesign as part of my Redux project in which I aim to redesign many of Skyrims clutter, creatures and environments to a modern standard while keeping in mind performance and optimization.
