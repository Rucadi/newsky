**Oiia Cat Follower**

  
  
  
**Overview**

Oiia Cat Comes to Skyrim!

This mod adds **Oiia Cat** the cat meme icon as a fully functional follower. You can find her waiting for you at the **Sleeping Giant Inn** in Riverwood. She will travel with you, carry your items, and fight alongside you! If you have some Skooma, give it to her. During combat, she’ll use it to get “high” and gain a unique battle effect.
