Several months ago I published [Gladys the Corgi](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50164)﻿ which aimed to add my own dog into Skyrim. I had a lot of fun making it, but there was one problem: I have another dog! For the longest time the lack of a proper Cardigan Corgi asset kept me from working on this mod, however, a few weeks ago [Jelidity](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/4569617) ﻿kindly provided me with a lovely model that fit my needs perfectly.
  
  
When designing this mod I did not want it to turn into a reskinned Gladys, so I set out to make sure the two companions behaved differently. Gladys was a merchant dog, so she is very good at hoarding items and carrying them for you. This new follower, Merlin, will live up to his name by being a combat-oriented follower that can utilized an arsenal of magical attacks.
  
  
Travel to the [Summoning Circle](https://gamemap.uesp.net/sr/?world=skyrim&layer=day&x=-42578&y=78007&zoom=17)﻿﻿﻿ just north of Morthal to meet your new friend. Merlin is ready to join you on your adventure and protect you with tooth and spell![/left]

* A new magical corgi follower named Merlin.
A unique model and hat accessory to make him stand out from the rest of Skyrim's dogs.
  
* A magic system that will allow Merlin to intelligently choose between several magical forms to most effectively dispatch his enemies.
Fully integrated into the vanilla Pet Framework (the same one used by Creation Club pets) in order to utilize all the features other pets have access to.
  
* Fully re-voiced sound effects using audio from my own pet corgi!

**Recommended Mods**
  
  
I highly recommend you use this mod with [Skyrim: Extended Cut - Saints and Seducers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72772)﻿ alongside the provided integration patch. It changes Merlin's acquisition to be much more interesting and memorable. I consider this to be the "canon" way you obtain Merlin.

Merlin ﻿uses a custom follower framework and should **NOT** be imported into follower framework mods such as [Amazing Follower Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6656)﻿, [Extensible Follower Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7003)﻿, or [Nether's Follower Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18076).[/left]
