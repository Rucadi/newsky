 Have you tried [RAID Weathers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63116)? - the weather mod optimised for detection mechanics.
  
  
[font=Trebuchet MS][size=2][color=#ffffff][color=#BF9000]Shameless plug: If you're looking for a simple modding guide, take a look at my [Concise Skyrim Modding Guide](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38334).
  
  
[/color][/color][font=Trebuchet MS]**[size=4]Introduction**[/size][/font][font=Trebuchet MS]
  
[/font][font=Trebuchet MS]This is a complete recalibration of Skyrim's detection formula, which improves the balanced and realism of sneaking. It is not a "hardcore" mod - sneaking is both harder and easier where necessary. You can use it by itself, or load it after perk and gameplay overhaul mods.
  
  
Instead of making simple tweaks to the vanilla settings (like other detection mods do), this mod holistically re-calibrates the whole formula from the ground up. This represents over 350 hours of meticulous research and optimization work.
  
  
  
  
[size=4]**Features**[/size]
  
[/font]

  
* [font=Trebuchet MS]No scripts. No perk edits. No performance impact. 100% reliable.[/font]
[font=Trebuchet MS]NPC view cone is reduced to 160deg (from 190deg in vanilla).[/font]
  
* [font=Trebuchet MS]Ambient light, equipment weight, and line-of-sight are now more important than your sneak skill level. Enemies won't become deaf and blind as you increase your sneak level and perks.[/font]
[font=Trebuchet MS]NPCs are much more sensitive to light. They can now see better in dimly lit environments, and will quickly spot you if you are carrying a light source. Even equipping a spell that lights up your hand will get you spotted. However, in total darkness (with a mod like ELFX Hardcore) NPCs will be blind.[/font]
  
* [font=Trebuchet MS]A higher attenuation factor in the detection formula enables NPCs to see you realistically in very low light levels when very near, without making detection over-powered at further distances (same applies to hearing). It also makes this mod scale better to different perk, armor, and lighting mods.[/font]
[font=Trebuchet MS]The difference between NPC detection range for interiors and exteriors has been greatly reduced. (in vanilla, enemies had x2.1 more detection range outside compared to inside. RAID increases interior ranges significantly, but reduces the outdoor range multiple to between x1.1 or x1.3 depending on the version). Overall this means RAID indoors detection range is about 30% higher than vanilla, while outdoor detection range is about the same as vanilla.[/font]
  
* [font=Trebuchet MS]Enemies will search longer - 70 seconds if you fire an arrow into their knee (was 20), ~70 sec after losing track of someone in combat (was ~40), 40 sec if they find a dead body (was 15), and 20-50 sec if they see or hear something (was 12-20).[/font]
[font=Trebuchet MS] When searching, enemies will do a better job checking corners, and they will cover a larger area.[/font]
  
* [font=Trebuchet MS]The huge difference between standing and sneaking has been reduced to a realistic amount. No longer will enemies detect you unfairly far away just because you were standing, and neither will they become blind and deaf the moment you start to sneak.[/font]
[font=Trebuchet MS]NPC wall-hacking has been reduced in various scenarios: In vanilla, if you broke line-of-sight in combat, NPCs could wall-hack you for up to 10 seconds - this has now been reduced to 5 seconds (making it easier to evade a pursuing enemy, and then backstab them). In vanilla, any nearby enemy with a sneak skill over 50 would wall-hack you indefinitely if you were standing - this effect has now been reduced. In vanilla, casting any loud spell would heavily drain your ability to stay hidden for 5 seconds, which usually resulted in getting wall-hacked over large distances for 10 seconds - this has now been reduced to a slight drain for only 2 seconds, which almost eliminates wall-hacking.[/font]
  
* [font=Trebuchet MS]"Invisibility" and "Muffle" effects now work when standing and running. In vanilla, these effects did not work against any enemy type when out of sneak mode. With this mod, if you have both "invisibility" and "muffle" active, you will now be 100% undetectable to low level bandits, even while sprinting right in-front of them. However, enemies with enhanced detection abilities, like mages, vampires, falmer, and dragons, will be able to see through these effects when you are standing or running (but not as much as in vanilla).[/font]
[font=Trebuchet MS]If an enemy has not detected you yet and is in combat with someone else, it is now easier to sneak past or backstab them (since all their attention is focused on combat). This effect is stronger in dark environments.[/font]
  
* [font=Trebuchet MS]NPC reaction time is slightly increased in some situations. If you suddenly appear in front of a relaxed enemy, they may need a second to realise you are an enemy (instead of instantly attacking as they do in vanilla).[/font]
[font=Trebuchet MS]Sleeping enemies have slightly reduced hearing abilities (in vanilla their hearing was the same as when awake).[/font]
  
* [font=Trebuchet MS]Enemies will notice dead bodies 10m away and start a search (was 5m in vanilla). Civilians are also more likely to react to dead bodies nearby instead of ignoring them as they often do in vanilla.[/font]
[font=Trebuchet MS]When someone sees you commit a crime, the distance guards come running has been reduced significantly.[/font]

[size=4]**5 versions for different user preferences and various lighting mod setups**[/size][/font][font=Trebuchet MS]
  
You can only use one version at the same time. It is safe to swap versions or uninstall during a playthrough.
  
You can use any RAID version with any lighting/weather mod setup you want, but my recommendations are provided in the 2nd image above.
  
  
Realistic AI Detection Lite
  
Small increase to NPC visual detection ability both indoors and outdoors. Small audio detection rebalance.
  
This is what vanilla detection should have been. This version is optimal for vanilla lighting if you want a bit more realism but not much more difficulty.
  
After checking the 2nd image above, if you are still not sure what version to get, start with this one, and upgrade to a more powerful version later if needed.
  
  
Realistic AI Detection - Medium Interior, Medium Exterior
  
Medium increase to NPC visual detection ability both indoors and outdoors. Moderate audio detection rebalance.
  
 This version is suitable for vanilla lighting and many other lighting/weather mods if you want much more realistic and challenging sneak gameplay.
  
  
Realistic AI Detection - High Interior, High Exterior
  
Large increase to NPC visual detection ability both indoors and outdoors. Moderate audio detection rebalance.
  
This version is [color=#ff0000]over-powered for Vanilla and most other lighting/weather mods, but ideal for ELFX Enhancer/Hardcore and RAID Weathers.
  
This is the original version of the mod I use myself in combination with ELFX "Hardcore" and RAID Weathers - *the way its meant to be played.*[/color]
  
Realistic AI Detection - High Interior, Medium Exterior
  
Large increase to indoor visual detection ability, medium increase to outdoor detection. Moderate audio detection rebalance.
  
This version is [color=#ff0000]over-powered for Vanilla and most other lighting/weather mods.
  
[/color]
  
Realistic AI Detection - Medium Interior, High Exterior
  
Medium increase to indoor visual detection ability, large increase to outdoor detection. Moderate audio detection rebalance.
  
This version is [color=#ff0000]over-powered for Vanilla and most other lighting/weather mods.
  
[/color]
  
**Lighting/weather mods and stealth gameplay balance**
  
Light-based detection mechanics in Skyrim are controlled by two things. First, the lighting/weather mods you use, and second, the detection mod you use. The lighting/weather mod controls what amount of light is in a location. The detection formula (tweaked by "Realistic AI Detection") then controls how that amount of light affects detection mechanics. [font=Trebuchet MS][size=2][font=Trebuchet MS][size=2][font=Trebuchet MS][size=2]If a lighting/weather mod does not provide appropriate lighting data to the detection formula, then there is little a detection mod like this can do to fix it.[/font][/size][/font][/size][/font]
  
  
One of the reasons some lighting/weather mods do not provide appropriate lighting data, is that Skyrim's engine does not feed all forms of lighting data into the detection formula. As far as I know, only "Sunlight Scale" in the imagespace records, and "Ambient" and "Sunlight" in the weather records are fed into the detection formula. All other imagespace and weather records (including "DALC" data), and external effects like ENB and Reshade, are ignored by the detection formula. So if a lighting/weather mod makes nights very dark the wrong way, the game engine still interprets that night as vanilla bright. So, the player could be blinded by the darkness, while enemy NPCs would still spot you easily from afar, which feels unfair (example: any dark ENB presets). The opposite is also possible - some mods appear as bright as vanilla but tell the detection formula it is extremely dark - resulting in near-blind NPCs in well lit environments (example: Luminosity).
  
There can be other problems too: some mods provide higher light levels for stormy or foggy weather than clear weather, and some mods provide higher light levels for a particular weather type at night than the same weather during the day.
  
While some of these flaws can be easily fixed by lighting/weather mod authors, [optimising a whole weather mod for detection balance is hard work](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63116).
  
  
[font=Trebuchet MS][font=Trebuchet MS][size=2][font=Trebuchet MS][size=2]**I tested nearly every weather and lighting mod for detection balance, using "player.gll".** **See the second image above for the results.**[/font][/size][/font]
  
[/size][/font][font=Trebuchet MS]
  
The "**player.gll**" console command prints out values ranging from 0 to 150+, representing the "real" amount of light at your character that is used in detection calculations by NPCs.[/font] If you try this, make sure to disable RAID (as it affects results), and stay away from point-light sources like candles and fires. Also take shadows near buildings into consideration. Also note that after loading a save or changing the weather or time of day, "player.gll" readouts often glitch out, so it is best to unpause the game for a few seconds and re-take the "player.gll" reading a few times to ensure the correct value is displayed. In vanilla Skyrim, values for daytime range from about 40 to 150, and night values ranges from about 30 to 70, depending on the weather.[font=Trebuchet MS]

[/size][/font][/size][/font][font=Trebuchet MS][font=Trebuchet MS][size=2][size=2]You can of course use other weather and lighting mods. This “trifecta” just shows you how to get the best gameplay balance if that is your priority.
  
[/size]
  
**Installation**
  
[font=Trebuchet MS][size=2]Use your mod management program, or p[/font]ut the .esp file in your Skyrim/data folder and activate it in the mod tab from the main menu.
  
Place it near the bottom of your load order, below any mods that also edit detection settings.
  
Do not clean this mod with SSEEdit.[/size]
  
  
**Uninstalling**
  
Just uninstall it using your mod manager, or delete the mod's .esp file in Skyrim/data
  
It is 100% safe to uninstall or re-install during a serious playthrough.
  
  
**Compatibility with other mods**
  
**This mod must be loaded after any mods that also edit detection settings** (like [Immersive Citizens](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/173/?), [Requiem](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60888), [Combat Evolved](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1525/?), [Thief Skills Rebalance for Ordinator](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1137/?), and [NAT](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12842)).
  
 RAID is compatible with all lighting/weather mods, but your choice of those mods will strongly affect detection balance (even if you don't use RAID) as explained above. See the 2nd mod image for RAID version suggestions for different weather/lighting mods.
  
  
**More specific mod compatibility info:**
  
"[Magic Sneak Attacks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67613)" is compatible and highly recommended.
  
"[Dynamic Weather and Time Based Detection](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62546)" is compatible. Its features do not overlap much with RAID, so they can compliment each other.
  
           However, DWATBD can behave erratically sometimes. Test with it disabled if you encounter problems with detection.
  
Some users have reported that the hardcore sneaking component of "Ultimate Combat" conflicts with RAID.
  
Mods that add extra enemies to dungeons may sometimes cause problems when used with this mod - see the article tab for more info and a solution.
  
Mods that change detection settings via scripts (like Skytweak) may produce unexpected results if used in combination with this mod.
  
"[Improved Traps](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17592)" is compatible, but RAID will reduce the range enemies can hear traps by about 30% (a minor unintended side effect).
  
"Face Light" breaks detection mechanics if used with RAID as it makes bad edits to detection GMSTs using scripts.
  
"Invisibility" was problematic for some users, but others report no issues. If you have trouble, use the newer [Uninterrupted Invisibility](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21729) mod instead.
  
  
**Other mods that are technically fully compatible, but worsen or break detection mechanics, EVEN IF YOU DON'T USE RAID:**
  
"[EVLaS](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63725)" breaks shadow based detection mechanics at dawn/dusk/night whether you use RAID or not.
  
"Relationship Dialogue Overhaul" has a minor bug that prevents civilian NPCs from commenting on dead bodies they find.
  
Mods adding illumination effects to weapons may allow enemies to spot you easily. Note: vanilla weapon effects (like dawnbreaker) don't affect sneaking.
  
"Moon Phase Affects Brightness at Night" strongly affects detection balance, sometimes making it worse (depending on the weather mod you use).
  
  
**FAQ**
  
[font=Trebuchet MS][size=2]Q1: Can you please tell me what version of this mod to use with my specific mod setup.
  
A: Look at the 2nd picture above that lists most lighting mods and suggests a RAID version to go with them. If you are still unsure, sorry, I can't help you. There are so many different mod setups out there, and detection balance is very subjective anyway. If in doubt, just try RAID "Lite" first.
  
You can always try another version later. It is 100% safe to uninstall or reinstall another version during a serious playthrough.[/font]
  
  
Q2: Do I need to use the "High" version if my mods make the game much darker? 
  
A: Not necessarily. Darker lighting mods do not always affect detection the way you would expect. See the "lighting/weather mods" section above.
  
  
Q3: I tried the "Lite" version but it still feels too difficult. Help?
  
A: Obviously sneaking will be a bit harder with this mod, but you should be fine if you use common sense. Some basic advice:
  
   1. Make sure your other mods are not messing up detection (like dark ENBs as explained further up).
  
[font=Trebuchet MS]   2. Avoid enemy line-of-sight, no matter how high your sneak skill/perk level is.[/font]
  
   3. Don't equip any light source, including spells that light up your hand.
  
   4. Invest in the "stealth" and "muffled movement" sneak perks (or their equivalent if you use a perk mod).
  
[font=Trebuchet MS]   5. The invisibility potion or spell will be essential in some situations.[/font]
  
   6. Stay in the shadows, where it is dark. (ELFX Enhancer/ELE/RLO/Ambiance make sneaking easier as they makes dungeons darker, the correct way)
  
   7. Keep the total weight of your equipped armor and weapon low. (Note - anything not equipped has no effect on sneaking).
  
   8. When sneaking up to someone from behind, it is best to move slowly (use the walk button on keyboard) when you get close.
  
   9. Get creative and devise new tactics like this - [Using inigo's teleport ability to stealth one-shot a bandit chief](https://youtu.be/v75mlewTBy4)
  
[font=Trebuchet MS]Q4: Sometimes NPCs are very slow to detect me (even when not sneaking), or other NPCs (even if hit by a "Frenzy" spell). Is it caused by this mod?
  
A: Possibly, but only to a limited extent. If you are using [font=Trebuchet MS][size=3][font=Trebuchet MS][size=2][font=Trebuchet MS][size=2]RAID "Lite", it may mean your lighting setup requires a more powerful version of RAID like "medium" or "high"[/font][/size][/font][/size][/font]. However, some lighting/weather mods have detection balance problems (as explained higher up this page) that can't be fixed by any version of RAID - in that case you would need to fix your lighting setup, or accept this side effect, or stop using RAID.
  
 Vanilla detection does not exhibit this problem as much because it allows NPCs that can't see anything (because of your choice of lighting mod) to still sense or "wall-hack" nearby targets that are not in sneak mode. RAID greatly reduces this wall-hacking ability thus forcing NPCs to rely more on sight and hearing - which works fine with vanilla lighting, or a well designed lighting/weather mod, but otherwise will not.
  
 Also check your load order for any mods mentioned in the compatibility section.[/size][/font]
  
  
Q5: How does RAID compare with Ordinator's optional Thief Skills Rebalanced module? Are they compatible?
  
A: They are only compatible if you put RAID lower in your load order, as RAID must overwrite any detection settings.
  
Get Thief Skills (without RAID) if you just want slightly harder vanilla sneak mechanics. It feels similar to vanilla.
  
Get RAID if you want a total overhaul of sneak mechanics. It feels very different from vanilla.
  
  
Q6: I want to play a sneaky mage, but enemies keep spotting me when I have a glowing spell in my hands. What can be done about this?
  
A: After extensive testing, I have found that l[font=Trebuchet MS]ooking slightly down from horizontal strongly increases the effect spell glow has on detection. This is a quirk of how Skyrim's detection works, it has nothing to do with RAID. Looking up by just 5deg from horizontal will minimise how much NPCs can detect spell glow. It sounds silly, but its true![/font] Try this with the "player.gll" console command if you don't believe me.
  
Also, there is a mod called "[Lights Out](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18263)" that disables spell glow when equipped in your hand. It has compatibility patches for many magic mods.
  
You could also try "[The Art of Shadow](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18159)" mod, which gives you 2 spells to create darkness to hide in (the opposite of candlelight and magelight).
  
And, if you play a sneaky mage, don't forget to try "[Magic Sneak Attacks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67613)".
  
  
Q7: Enemies and/or followers are sometimes unresponsive in my game, as if they are brain dead. Is it caused by this mod?
  
A: No. Check your other mods. Some people even experience this problem in vanilla Skyrim. Also, if your setup has script lag or generally poor performance, detection responsiveness may suffer as a result.
  
Also note, the "Immersive Citizens" mod will stop civilians and named NPCs from retaliating when you attack, if you are a much higher level than them (they are not brain dead, but controlled by an "avoid combat" AI package).
  
  
Q8: Does this mod affect NPCs, mod added NPCs, followers, animals, dragons, falmer etc? Does it affect how NPCs can detect other NPCs?
  
A: Yes. It affects the detection of everything. This is the case with all detection mods, not just mine.
  
  
Q9: Falmer can see me if I use this mod. Aren't Falmer supposed to be blind?
  
A: Falmer are NOT 100% blind. They are actually 80% blind according to the game files. In vanilla this may seem like 100% because normal NPC vision is already very weak. In RAID, all enemies can see much better, including Falmer, but their sight is still 80% worse than that of a normal enemy.
  
  
Q10: Does this mod work in [Enderal SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/enderalspecialedition/mods/1)?
  
A: Yes.
  
  
Q11: Did Bethesda change how detection behaves in Special Edition, compared to Legendary Edition.
  
A: Yes and no. There are no major changes, and the detection formula is identical. However, Bethesda did make small changes to lighting, particularly the weather at night. Special Edition nights have even more light than Legendary Edition nights.
  
  
[/size]**Technical information, and DIY tweaking**
  
This mod edits 45 game settings (GMST), and deliberately includes an additional 14 ITM edits. The ITMs are safe and ensure this mod functions correctly when loaded after a mod that also edits detection GMSTs.
  
 If you want to know more about what these GMSTs do, download the "GMST Datasheet" on the download page.
  
  
Also, I have sorted these GMST records in xEdit logically by subsystem, in the same order as shown below to make it easer for you to tweak them yourself.
  
I have added short notes to some to tell you what to change or not. The ones without notes are best left alone unless you really know what you are doing.
  
Avoid the temptation to directly compare my values to vanilla in isolation! Many of these GMSTs interact with each other so context is very important.

[size=6]**List of Rated Quest / Dungeon Mods:**
  
Here's a list of Skyrim quest mods I have played, and rated, as objectively as possible (just my opinion).
  
I hope this helps you find some good quest mods you may not have tried before (and I hope it helps you to avoid wasting time on the bad ones).
  
  
Note: well known mods in **bold**
  
Note: "#" indicates a mod unsuitable for a non-dragonborn player character
