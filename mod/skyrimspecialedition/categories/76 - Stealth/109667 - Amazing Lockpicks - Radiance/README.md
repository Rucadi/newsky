**Description**
  
Adds extra gem-based lockpicks to [Amazing Lockpicks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/108832) with unique textures and new models.
  
  
Vendors will consider these lockpicks as gems or soul gems instead of lockpicks and might be more interested in buying your shiny picks.
  
  
The lockpick strengths are based on the gold value of the vanilla gems. From weakest to strongest, the added lockpicks are:
  
  
Petty (empty), lesser (empty), petty (filled), common (empty), lesser (filled), garnet, greater (empty), amethyst, flawless garnet, common (filled), flawless amethyst, ruby, grand (empty), black (empty), flawless ruby, greater (filled), sapphire, flawless sapphire, grand (filled), emerald, flawless emerald, black (filled), diamond, flawless diamond.

I modified and removed some of the vertices, edges, and faces and separated the individual lockpick models. I rescaled it and converted it to obj and nif formats and used different textures. In addition, I bisected some of the models then added animations to use when it enters a scene, shakes, and breaks.
