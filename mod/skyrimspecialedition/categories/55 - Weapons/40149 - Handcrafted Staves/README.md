**Ported to [Xbox](https://bethesda.net/en/mods/skyrim/mod-detail/4180452) by****MerildesTabris and TwoSecond on Bethesda.net**
  
**New update 2.6 brings new alternative casting variants for Black, Greater and Lesser Staff
  
Featuring floating soul gem!**
  
  
This is the remake and remaster of my old mod "soul gems staff", come with new handmade-aesthetic design inspired from common mage staff with crystal.
  
  
There are 6 main staves, each represent 6 different types of soul gems, come with unique enchantment for offense, crowd-control, healing, and buffing.
  
  
Most balanced during mid and end game, some make great sidearm, ambush, or for supporting your allies.
  
  
These staves uses vanilla textures, they will benefit from any retexture mod you use.
  
  
These staves were made to be used with [CGO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33767) in mind, each staff were given damage value, impact set and sound fx like other melee weapons.
  
  
  
**Major additions in update 2.0**
  
                       [![](https://iili.io/2dVAJf.gif)](https://freeimage.host/)Right... a magical staff appear out of nowhere and doesn't stay on your back when sheathed may seem unrealistic to (some of) you?
  
The "lore" (my own bs) behind these bound variants is: instead of conjuring a weapon from Oblivion, a mage can store their weapons in a dimensional storage, and deploy them at will. This spell belongs to the school of Alteration.
  
  
Add bound variant for each staff. They can be acquired by breaking down your **staff** along with some **paper rolls** and **leathers** at **Staff Enchanter**, creating a spell tome which you can read to learn its spell.
  
  
  The bound variants eliminate the need of carrying an actual staff, saving carry weight for other items.
  
They will last for 1 day, as long as you don't lower your hands. 
  
  
  They don't need to be recharged, simply cast your spell again to summon a new, fully charged staff.
  
  
  But there's always a catch. The spell cost 100 magicka to cast, then will drain all of your Magicka pool. A mage with Alteration level 25 and higher can cast these spells for less Magicka. Having larger Magicka pool and quicker regen help a lot.
  
  
  These bound variants only held a much lower amount of charges compared to normal staves, and they cannot be recharged by any mean other than                     recasting anew. 
  
  
These staves are now classified as both staff and warhammer. Melee damage value now scale with your Two-Handed skill. For usage with [CGO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33767)

**Crafting**
  
  
You will need to discover and learn about how a staff has been researched and invented by a certain unknown mage, mysteriously disappeared.
  

```
SpoilerThe unknown mage's torn page along with their belongings can be found near Darkwater Crossing, next to a volcanic spring. By reading it you will be given a hidden perk which shall let you craft these staves. Check photo section for screenshot of exact location
```

  
All 6 staves can be crafted at a tanning rack, require arcane smithing perk, firewoods, leather strips and one filled soul gem of relevant type.
  
  
The same station can be used to swap between normal and alternative variants of Black, Greater and Lesser staff, costing some leather wraps and an equivalent amount of soul gems needed to fully recharge that particular staff of the same type.
  
  
All recipes have declutter condition, crafting recipes will only appear if you have at least 1 correct type of soul gem in your inventory.
