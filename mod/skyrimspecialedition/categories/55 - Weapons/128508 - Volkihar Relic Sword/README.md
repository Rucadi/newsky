> *﻿﻿...Among vampires, few match the greatness of high status and power as Volkihar Clan, founded by pure blood vampires touched by the unholy essence of Molag Bal. By pledging their souls and body to the**The Lord of Domination, those vampires manage to achieve new levels of vampiric power through a proccess that not many can withstand without sucumbing completely, but those who do, will never fear again, and will forever walk as a lion among sheep. This is what Lord Harkon, head of the Volkihar Clan used to say.
>   
>   
>  ﻿A long time ago, the second in command to Lord Harkon was his brother, a vampire who was skilfull in the craft of weapon smithing and magical manipulation, using his abilities he forged a weapon born from a fraction of Molag Bal's blood, a sword whose malice was so great it contained a will of its own, only lending its power to those it saw fit. The blade lusted for blood, always thirst, always craving for more, when fed, the Volkihar Relic Sword bloodlust would reach its maximum, unleashing devastating life absorption on anyone in its path.
>   
>   
>  ﻿One day, under polemic circunstances, Lord Harkon entered in combat against his own brother, after a long tiresome battle, the brother ended up defeated, but unable to slain his own blood, Harkon forever banished him, depriving him from a great portion of its powers, and ordered that his name would be erased from the Clan's history, never to be spoken or mentioned again.
>   
>   
>  ﻿To this day, only Harkon knows why the conflict started, but the weapon remained in his possesion, but one day, the blade that was always seen being carried by him anywhere he went, was nowhere to be seen, he certainly have hidden it somewhere. But from time to time, echoes of the blade can be heard in the dark hallways of Volkihar Castle, just waiting to be fed again...*

The relic sword is a bloodlust artifact that yearns for the vital energy of its enemies, and its strikes can cause profound bleed to extract blood from most beings.
  
  
Upon equipping the weapon you will be granted an effect called "Volkihar Strenght".
  
  
**- Volkihar Strenght -**
  
  
Grants the weapon an additional **30% damage** if you are a **Vampire Lord.**
  
  
Grants the weapon a passive effect that causes deep bleed on your enemies. Every hit stacks 1 counter to the bleed, when reaching a certain amount of stacks, the target receives a big amount of bleed damage instantly. You need to wait a few seconds before begin stacking the bleed on the same target again.
  
  
**- Volkihar Grandeur -**
  
  
For every major bleed caused by the weapon, 1 stack is added to weapon, which strengthens the next bleed you will cause in the enemy.
  
  
**1 Stack:** Bleed damage causes 25% more damage
  
**2 Stacks:** Bleed damage causes 50% more damage
  
**3 Stacks:** Bleed damage causes 100% more damage
  
  
At 3 stacks, the player is granted the ability **"Volkihar Grandeur"** which causes the weapon inflict **fear** on every strike and unleash waves of energy on every swing, the waves **absorbs 20 points of health for 1 second** and can hit multiple enemies at once, the effect lasts 15 seconds.
  
(Stacks are removed when the ability is activaded).
  
  
**The sword can be enchanted.**

Adventurers from all around Skyrim have told stories about echoes﻿ of malice and seduction, which appears to always call them to the same directions of **Castle Volkihar**, perhaps someone in there have kept a register about the sword.
