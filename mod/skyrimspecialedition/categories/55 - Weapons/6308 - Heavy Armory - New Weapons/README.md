**The goal of Heavy Armory is to expand the variety of weapons used in the world of Skyrim in an immersive and lore-friendly way.**
  
[size=2][size=2]If you’re looking for some new and lore-friendly weapons to wield (or get your face bashed in with!), then
  
look no further! Heavy Armory is the mod for you! [/size]
  
  
**Heavy Armory adds roughly 150 new lore-friendly weapons**. [size=2]All new weapons are spread throughout level lists, so you will encounter them naturally on enemies, in shops, in loot, and as rewards. You can also craft them from any forge (if you have the necessary skill and resources). [/size]
  
  
[/size]

  
* Discover 11 new weapon types, some of which were present in past Elder Scrolls titles: **Clubs, Halberds, Hatchets, Glaives, Long Maces, Mauls, Quarterstaves, Shortspears, Shortswords, Spears and Tridents**. All have different characteristics, making them individual and interesting to use. Halbers, spears and staves come with new, OAR compatible animations.
Some factions (like the **Alik'r, Dawnguard, Draugr, Falmer, Forsworn, Imperials and Silver Hand**) have their own weapon sets, which were limited to a handful of different weapons. Heavy Armory expands these sets by adding a new weapon options, which in turn makes fighting with or against these factions a lot more dynamic.
  
* Customizability is key! Don't like the new polearms and aim for a more vanilla experience? If you use SkyUI, you'll have acces to a new Heavy Armory MCM menu that allows you to toggle "lite" mode. This disables all Halberds, Spears, and Tridents, but leaves all the other new content.

Marvel at my spreadsheet skills! This is a full overview of what Heavy Armory adds to your game. All weapons marked in blue are added by this mod.[font=Georgia]**![](https://i.imgur.com/Ce71Kue.jpeg)﻿** [/font]
  
  
  
[line][font=Georgia]NEW WEAPON TYPES[/font]

[line]

  
* **Club** - Uses Mace perks, and Mace animations
**Halberd** - Uses Battle Axe perks, and custom Halberd animations (without OAR, reverts to Battle Axe animations)
  
* **Hatchet -** Uses War Axe perks and animations
**Long Mace** - Uses Warhammer perks and animations
  
* **Maul** - Uses Mace perks and animations
**Quarterstaff** - Uses Warhammer perks, and custom Quarterstaff animations (without OAR, reverts to Warhammer animations)
  
* **Shortspear** - Uses Sword perks, and custom Shortspear animations (without OAR, reverts to Sword animations)
**Shortsword** - Uses Sword perks and animations
  
* **Spear, Glaive, and Trident** - Uses Greatsword perks and custom Pike animations (without OAR, reverts to greatsword animations)

  
Each weapon type has stats that fit to their build, making them all fit to different playstyles and fullfill a different function.  **![](https://i.imgur.com/VK1JFUW.jpeg)﻿**

NEW WEAPON MATERIALS

* **Wood** - Yes, wooden weapons. You were asking for more weapons, and I gave you the worst! You'll find Wooden weapons on low levels on bandits and hunters. Have mercy on the poor bandit who charges at you with a big stick! You can also craft these weapons yourself without any perk requirements!
**Polished Silver** - I like Silver weapons, but I hate that they become obsolete very quickly due to their poor stats. So I made a higher tier, in the same vein as the "Honed" weapons Draugr carry. At higher levels, the Silver Hand will carry these Polished Silver weapons, which are roughly Elven tier in damage.
  
Polished SIlver can be crafted after unlcoking the Advanced Armors perk.
  
In the future I plan to add more of these "honed" tiers for other weapons like Forsworn and Redguard

CRAFTING

I "unlocked" certain vanilla materials that weren't craftable before. Since I extended those tiers with more weapons, it seemed like a shame to not make them accesible. But, I did try to gate them in a way that makes sense.
  
  

  
* Blades - Craftable with the Orcish Smithing perk, and after completeing [Alduin's Wall](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Alduin%27s_Wall)﻿.
Dawnguard - Craftable with the Steel Smithing perk and after having completed the [Prophet quest](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Prophet_(Dawnguard))﻿﻿.
  
* Imperial - Craftable with the Steel Smithing perk and after having [joined the Imperial Legion](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Joining_the_Legion)﻿.
Redguard - Craftable with the Advanced Armors perk. No quest requirements.
  
* Silver - Craftable with the Steel Smithing perk. No quest requirements.

  
If for some reason you don't want these weapons to be craftable, you can easily deactivate them through the Heavy Armory MCM menu. The WACCF patch will disable these recipes by default in favour of WACCF and CCOR's own recipes.

HEAVY ARMORY LITE

[/font][/size][/size][/size][/size]**[b][size=2][b][size=2][b][size=2][b][size=2][line]**[/size][/b][/size][/b][/size][/b][/size][/b][/size]
  
If for whatever reason you want to play Heavy Armory without any polearm weapons (Halberds, (Short)spears, Tridents), Heavy Armory gives you the option to switch over into a "Lite" version. This effectively deactiavtes those weapons in your game.
  
All crafting recipes will be removed and no polearms will spawn anymore. Note that any polearms that were already present in your game will remain. So while it's totally fine to switch betwene version mid-game, for the best experience I advice to settle on one version at the start of a new playthrough.
  
  
You switch Lite mod on or off by accesing the Heavy Armory MCM menu. This requires SkyUI.

Heavy Armory makes changes to many level lists throughout the game, so this is bound to "conflict" with some mods. I recommend using [Wrye Bash](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6837) to merge these changes.
  
Some weapons were added to the **Sleeping Giant Inn** and **Skyhaven Temple**. If you have other mods that change these locations, I recommend you load them after Heavy Armory.
  
  
**Heavy Amory is fully compatible with texture replacers, since all new weapons will use the same textures as the vanilla weapons do.
  
  
[line]**
  
**Soft Requirements**
  
The following mods are "soft requirements" for Heavy Armory. This means you technically don't need them to run the mod, but you won't have acces to all the features
  
  
[SkyUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12604) - Required for the MCM menu to work, which allows you to toggle Lite mode and certain crafting recipes.
  
[Open Animation replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92109) (OAR) - Required for new animations to work. Without OAR, some weapons will revert to using vanilla animations, which might look weird.
  
[FormList Manipulator](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74037) - Patches a few formlists that Heavy Armory edits. Without it, you won't be able to craft new Daedric weapons at the Atronach Forge, for example.
  
[Sound Record Distributor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77815) - Only required for the Audio Overhaul for Skyrim and Immersive Sounds - Compendium patches.
  
[Constructible Object Custom Keyword System](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81409) - With this mod, all new Silver weapons (including Polished) will be grouped into a Silver category in the Crafting menu.

[Object Categorization Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81469) - Heavy Armory shares it's keywords with OCF, so any animation mod compatible with OCF should work with Heavy Armory too![Smith Armory Inventory Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/112989?tab=files) - Changes vendors invenory to make sense to their location and context (f.e. smiths in Markath sell Silver, and Orcish vendors sell Orcish, etc.).

[\*]**Do texture replacers work with Heavy Armory?**
  
Yes, as long as they override the original Skyrim textures.
  
  
[\*]**Does (Mod X) conflict with Heavy Armory?**
  
See the Compatibility section above. Also, remember that [Wrye Bash](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6837)﻿ is your friend.
  
  
[\*]**Will you create a patch for (Mod X)?**
  
I'll likely create a patch for any mod I use myself, but I won't invest time in patching for every mod conflict reported. I'm totally fine with people creating their own patches and sharing them though.
  
  
[\*]**Will animation (Mod Y) work with Heavy Armory?**
  
I can't say. Try it out and let me know.
  
  
[\*]**The game crahses!**
  
If you are on a Skyrim version below 1.6.1130 and expierence crashes, then you'll need to install [BEES](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441).
  
  
[\*]**Weapons appear invisible!**
  
This seems to be related to the BSA archive not loading correctly. Try downloading the mod again and reinstalling. This is known to fix the issue.
  
The mod installer also comes with an option to install all mesh files unpacked into your Data directory. This should also fix the problem.
  
  
[\*]**I don't like Spears, Halberds and Tridents!**
  
Heavy Armory comes with an MCM menu that let's you switch to a "Lite" mode. This means all polearm weapons will be deactivated. They won't spawn in game and can't be crafted.
  
  
[\*]**I switched to Lite mode but polearm weapons still appear!**
  
Crafting options for these weapons should be disabled right away, and they won't spawn new into the world. But if they were already loaded into any cell you've visted before, these weapons will remain there untill the cell is reset.
  
  
[\*]**Does this mod only work with OAR, or can I also use DAR?**
  
I would really advice you to switch to OAR at this point. But if for some reason you insist on using DAR, you can get a patch over [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74320). This mod was made with Animated Armoury in mind, but since HA uses the same animations and folder structure, it should be compatible.
  
  
[\*]**Can I translate Heavy Armory into another language?**
  
I’d be happy if you did!
  
  
[\*]**Can I use assets from your mod for my own mod project?**
  
Sure! But I’d ask you to notify me either through a PM or in the comment section (don't worry, you don't have to wait for a reply). Credits and a link back to my mod here would be appreciated.

Thank you! Yes, you! Everybody who ever downloaded, endorsed and/or commented on this mod. It’s because of you guys that I continue working on this stuff.
  
All the support means a lot to me and I’m happy that there are people who enjoy using my mods. Thanks for sticking around over the years!

  

**Also, a special thanks to...**
  
  
 [DrMonops](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/17251819)﻿, for without his help and guidance, Heavy Armory would not be the mod that it is today.
  
[Petepocalypse](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/78877628)﻿, for his Resurgence patches
  
[titanbass1](https://forums.nexusmods.com/profile/32373690-titanbass1/)﻿, for the Cathedral patch, and various other patches
  
[NickaNak](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3127912)﻿, for allowing me to integrate AA's animation files.
