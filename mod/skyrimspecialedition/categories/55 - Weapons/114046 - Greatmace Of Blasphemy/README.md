*"...In the eternal burning fires in the Deadlands, surprisingly enough, a great variety of life and materials can be found in this dreadful realm of Oblivion. Around the sections where The Burn and The Sever meet, a very rare form of mineral can be formed, the Scarlet Plasma Crystal, a form of volcanic glass that permanently holds the energy from the terrible flames of the realm, although unstable, the cursed flames can still be channeled through the use of magic.**The Mythic Dawn once held one of those crystals, and used it to forge a weapon that only the mightiest warriors of the order could handle, this accursed huge greathammer is an artifact that embodies the will of destruction of all the creation and every good in it.
  
  
It is said that this weapon was once used to deliver a fatal blow to a leader from the Vigil of Stendarr, destroying an important chapter of the order a long time ago, thus as the enemies from the Mythic Dawn called the weapon, so it earned its name, The Greatmace Of Blasphemy..."*

*"...When wielded, the greatmace bestows the user with the power to channel the flames of Oblivion on the weapon, enchanting it with extremely hot fire, quickly burning your enemies..."*
  
  
When the weapon is equipped, the player recieves a lesser power that can be used to activate the fire enchantment on the Greatmace Of Blasphemy, dealing high fire damage that burns for 3 seconds.
  
  
Costs 75 magicka to cast.

*"...A strong eerie energy have been felt around the area of the shrine dedicated to Mehrunes Dagon by those who wander too close﻿, perhaps a artifact is calling to be wielded once more...and will probably demand a sacrifice of some sort..."*
  
  
*SpoilerThe Greatmace is protected by a cursed magical barrier, it demands a sacrifice to be lifted, you will need 3 human hearts and a Filled Black Soul Gem, then the weapon can be wielded once again.*
