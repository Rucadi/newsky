# Silver Edge - Silver Sword and Greatsword Model Replacers
- Author: Vilidran
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46875


These are model replacers for the Silver Sword and Greatsword mostly inspired by the weapons used by Geralt in The Witcher Netflix series, where sword variants 1 and 2 take their likeness from.
  
  
As these use the Silver Sword as the base model, most variants will use your current Silver sword retexture except for all the modified scabbard and Variant 2 which has its own modified texture.
  
  
v1.1 - A new, unique weapon set for the Silver Hand has been added along with various leveled-list integration.
  
  
 ***﻿\* Silver Hand set can only be crafted when you finish the quest "The Silver Hand".***
  
  
  
  
Tempering and crafting data included in the standalone plugin are mostly based from the mod [Upgradeable and Craftable Silver Weapons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/8905) by [OlBrentonoftheWest](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/1014034). Crafting the standalone silver weapons requires you to have **Steel Smithing Perk**.﻿
  
  
  
  
**Standalone file included as an optional file (no leveled-list).
  
  
[b]DSR/Ecotone patches included in all files.**
