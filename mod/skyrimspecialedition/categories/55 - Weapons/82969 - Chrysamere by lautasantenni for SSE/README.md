Original description:
  
  
This adds the legendary paladin blade Chrysamere to the game.
  
  
There are several Chrysamere mods out there and for sake of variaty, here is another.
  
  
This mod adds Chrysamere, broken into pieces and spread out through Skyrim. Once you find the scabbard piece, you can see the forging recipe under "Steel" -category. To forge it you need all the pieces and the Arcane Blacksmith ability.
  
  
The first piece and clue to rest will be found at the Halted Stream Camp, north of Whiterun.
  
  
The sword has a base damage of 25, causes 40 fire damage on hit to undead, daedra, vampires and werewolves, and drains out targets mana regardless of being unholy or not.
