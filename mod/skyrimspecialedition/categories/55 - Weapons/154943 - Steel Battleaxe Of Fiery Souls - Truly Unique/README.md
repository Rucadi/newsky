> *﻿This ancient steel battleaxe rests beside the charred remains of a conjurer at Ironbind Barrow, deep within the snowy wilderness of The Pale. Though weathered by time, its edge still gleams with its fiery purpose, and its heart burns with something far more sinister.
>   
>   
> Some believe the weapon was once used in grim rituals, each soul consumed not merely for power, but to feed an unending hunger that lingers still in the artifact.
>   
> A cruel tool wrapped in steel and flame, it is as much a weapon as it is a sentence.*
