> *﻿During the reign of the Reman Dynasty there was an order of mages and warrior-scholars called the Ascendants, Founded by Nomadic priests worshiping the Magne-Ge and later developing into the Ascendant Order which was dedicated to the observation, study and magic of the stars. Each was armed with a magical Spear-staff made of Brass and Trithril (a magical alloy of Ebony and Refined Malachite) to channel the power they drew from the stars, Holes in oblivion leading to aetherius left behind by the fleeing Magne-Ge.
>   
>   
> Due to the growing ambitions of the Reman Dynasty to reach for the stars and inspired by the merethic era efforts of the Sunbirds of Alinor to explore the void above Mundus. The ascendant order was among the various groups hired and charged with assisting in the Second Empire's attempt to reach for the stars.
>   
>   
> With an arsenal of weapons derived from their spear-staves and through a mix of their own research, expeditions into ruins and prior to the conflicts between the Second Empire and Morrowind, exchange of research and blueprints with the followers of Sotha Sil, they would serve a small but important role in the founding of the empire's Mananaut program, The experimentation and construction of the Battlespires which would be launched far into the void between Mundus, Oblivion and Artherius. And eventually the efforts to reach Masser.
>   
>   
> With the Warrior sect gaining access to more and more variety of weapons they would assist as additional security where the Emperor's Dragonguard, were spread thin, or where the imperial army were not given clearance.
>   
>   
> Due to how closely the order relied on the funding from the Reman Dynasty, they too collapsed after the assassination of the last Reman emperor, as the Akaviri Potentates would shift funding elsewhere.
>   
>   
> Later on some of the staves and some other weapons would be recovered from Reman Era ruins on Masser in the aftermath of Tiber Sceptim's Sword Meeting with Cyrus the restless. And would later be passed down to the mage's guild, then eventually the College of Whispers, and Synod by the time of the 4th era. but grew increasingly rare over time.*

And now one such staff has been sighted with the Synod in Skyrim, Perhaps your Dragonborn could recreate the rest of this lost order's arsenal if they could get their hands on it, as all was derived from it?
  
Inspired by the Mage Upgrade class "Ascendant" from Dragonfable, which draws their magic from the power of constellations back in 2022 I made the spear-staff as a side-piece for a 3D Ataelan character I had attempted but failed to finish. (Ataelans being the race the tier 3 Upgrade classes are from).
  
And the Lore written up about in the above excerpt and the weapons various item descriptions drew heavily from the lore from the various editions of "Pocket Guide to the empire", and the extended semi-official lore from various former Bathesda writers such as Michael Kirkbride. Which expanded the topic with stuff such as Reman era ruins on masser, Tiber Septim and Cyrus the restless' battle across the moons and more. And even the constructions of the high-fantasy magical space-stations the Battlespires. (Which one spinoff game took place in)
  
  
Staff Located in Mzulft's final chamber on the table with the books and spell tomes to adjust the temperature of the Oculory.
  
  
So after digging around my old files and finding the staff I decided to try and make as many weapons as possible by editing the one mesh, with no additional textures. Which turned out better than expected but there is some stretching. So all 17 Melee weapons were the result of edits to the original staff, resulting in a whole weapon pack using only one set of texture files. (Due to how Stretched some of the weapons are, no alternate resolutions will be offered below 2k and 4k will be the default)
  
  
Requirements: For the weapons to use the proper movesets and get the correct Keywords requires the Synthesis Weapon keyword Patcher, if not it will just use vanilla weapon animations. OR Object Categorization Framework, Or Keyword Compatibility Framework. (or all three as I use). Since this weapon pack contains an expanded variety of weapons including most weapon types from Animated Armory, Curved Swords, Katana and Dai Katana and a scythe. those frameworks and getting appropriate animations will be needed for them to work as intended. if not they will use the animations of the closest vanilla weapon type.
  
The mod will function without these so not a HARD requirement, just a SOFT one, but it may look weird.
  
**Do not report it as a bug that they aren't using the right animations**, just use the frameworks listed above and make sure your chosen moveset animations in DAR or OAR have the assigned keywords included in their conditions folders From the synthesis patcher, OCF or KCF.
  
  
Crafting: Crafting recipes require the Ascendant order staff in your inventory to show up and use. All weapons (aside from the unique staff) can be crafted at any forge using a mix of Refined Malachite, Corundum and Ebony ingots and some leather strips. All crafted weapons are unenchanted.
  
Can be tempered at any Grindstone using 1 refined malachite.
  
  
Balance: The staff is quite powerful dealing a mix of Lightning and Fire damage in a concentrated beam, as for the various melee weapons they are slightly weaker than ebony but with adjusted stats elsewhere, with increased critical damage, lower weight, extended range or Higher speed in various combinations and amounts per weapon. Meaning they should balance out to be roughly side-grades.
