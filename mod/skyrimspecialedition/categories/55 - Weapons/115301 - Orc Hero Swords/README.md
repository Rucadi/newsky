*"...Few adventurers are allowed inside Orc Strongholds, one needs to prove its valor and strenght before being allowed to walk orcish grounds.
  
Even among its own community, orcs must prove themselves in a regular basis, those seen as unworthy may pay the price, be it with gold or blood.
  
Some orcs are so fearsome in battle and leadership, that they are granted special blades fit for someone of their might, specially crafted orichalcum blades with a valuable gem to go with it, symbolizing their status as a great warrior.
  
Usually this honor is reserved for orcs, but an outsider that proves himself by becoming a great Blood Kin may be granted such honor..."*

The mod adds 2 new weapons to the Orcish armoury:
  
  
- Orc Hero Greatsword
  
- Orc Hero Sword
  
  
They have a bit higher damage than main Orcish weapons, higher critical damage and slightly faster swing speed.
  
  
They can be crafted at any forge after you obtain **Orcish Smithing** and successfully completed the **Daedric Quest "The Cursed Tribe"**
