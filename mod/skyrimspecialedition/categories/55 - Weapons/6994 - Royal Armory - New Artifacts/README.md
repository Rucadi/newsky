What is Royal Armory?

  
  
  
Isn’t it strange that all the important characters in Skyrim like Ulfric Stormcloak and general Tullius walk around with common steel weapons? Meanwhile in Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings every noble and their daughters seem to be carrying a sword with a name.
  
Wouldn’t the Imperial General of Skyrim carry his own personal sword? Wouldn’t the most influential Jarls of the land have a weapon that fits to their station?
  
If that has bothered you as much as me then this is the mod for you!
  
  
The main goal of Royal Armory is to add immersion by giving the most important characters in Skyrim weapons to match their status.
  
There are no quests and no rewards in this mod. My idea was that you’ll encounter these weapons naturally during play through. Some of these weapons you can obtain when the owner dies, some you may be able to steal, and some you may never get your hands on. This is first and foremost an atmospheric mod.
  
  
But what if you are a collector and are looking for some new weapons to add to your collection?
  
You are not able to obtain every weapon during the game itself, but I did add an alternative way to obtain both enchanted and unenchanted versions of each weapon added by this mod. So no matter if you play this mod purely for immersion or as a collector of artifacts, you’ll be able to get what you need.
  
  
Like Heavy Armory my aim was to make new weapons that blend in seamlessly with the weapons Bethesda created.
  
That’s why I used bits and pieces of existing weapons to create new varieties. Basically, I don’t even want you to notice that there’s a mod running.

Installation

  
  
  
The easiest way to install the mod is by downloading and activating through the NMM. It will do all the work for you.
  
If for some reason you need / want to do a manual install just download and extract the content of the .7zip to your Skyrim/Data folder (choose overwrite if asked).
  
All that's left to do is activate the .esp and start the game!

Ysgramor's companions. Ulfric Stormcloak now wields the axe, and he

job before taking the position of Keeper. The task was to assassinate a
  
jester. Cicero returned with the dagger in hand and with his sanity

*“ Stormbird is a beautiful little sword, extremely detailed and
  
displaying some of the best Altmerian craftsmanship. But it doesn't take
  
 a trained eye to notice the weapon's bulk; Stormbird is a heavy and
  
clunky weapon for it's size.“*

***- Stamina damage 20 pts
  
- Shock damage 15 pts***
  
  
*“The Blade of Dragonsreach was forged by a particular influential Jarl
  
during the early 2nd era as a symbol of his power. After his death the

***- Fire damage 15 pts
  
- Boost Two Handed skill by 20 pts***
  
  
*“The curved swords of the Alik’r are a common design in Hammerfell. Yokuda’s
  
 Edge is a remarkable weapon that takes this curved design and applies
  
it to a two handed sword. Kematu’s sword is of truly exceptional
  
craftsmanship, allowing its wielder to swing at a speed that would seem
  
impossible for a weapon its size.“*

How to get these weapons?

  
  
Obviously you want to get your hands on these weapons now. There are 2 ways to do this:
  
  
1. Play the game and encounter each weapon naturally during playthrough.
  
This would be the immersive way. You'll encounter the weapons while playing through quests. Some you'll gte your hands on, other not.
  
For a detailed overview of where to find all weapons, [see this article](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/articles/50977/?).
  
  
  
2. You want these weapons now! Or you already finished certain quests and some weapons can't be obtained anymore because the characters wielding them are dead and gone. Or you simply want unenchanted version of these weapons to put your own enchantments on.
  
  
 Luckily for you there is another way!
  
Bring up your console using ` and type:
  
  
**coc PITestSpace**
  
  
You'll be transported to a room with both enchanted and unenchanted copies of every weapon added by this mod.
  
Try them out, take them with you and use them on your quests or put them on display. The choice is yours.
  
(Ps. You can fast travel back to Skyrim from the test space or just use console commands to return).

FAQ**Always be sure to read the above mod description first!
  
Still didn't find the answers you're looking for? Maybe you'll find them in this section.**[b]-Do Texture replacers work with HR?**
  
[/b]Yes, as long as they override the original Skyrim textures.**[b]-Does (Mod X) conflict with Royal Armory?**
  
[/b]Royal Armory is a very minimal mod. It only adds weapons to a few characters and makes some minimal changes to a few cells.
  
Mods that add weapons to the same characters as this mod obviously conflict. Mods that add armor to these characters should work fine.
  
Also mods that heavily modify the basement of Jorrvaskr may conflict, though you should test to see if this is the case or not.**[b]-Some/most weapons appear invisible.**
  
[/b]This issue could be related to the NMM. Try re-downloading the mod. If that doesn't fix the problem, try a manual install. This has been known to fix it.**[b]-Will you create a patch for (Mod X)?**
  
[/b]No. But if anybody would like to create a patch between HA and another mod they are free to do so. Upload your mod and send me a link so I can link to it in the description.**[b]-Can I translate Royal Armory to another language?**
  
[/b]I’d be happy if you did! Upload your translation and send me a link so I can link to it in the description.**-Can I use assets from your mod for my own mod project?**
  
Sure! But I’d ask you to notify me either through a PM or in the comment section. Also I want to be credited in your mod for the work you use.
