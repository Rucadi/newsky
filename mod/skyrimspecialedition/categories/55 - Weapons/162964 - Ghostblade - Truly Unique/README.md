> *Forged not by hand, but by memory... the lingering will of Fjori, whose love defied even death. When her restless spirit was freed from Ansilvund’s shadow, she left behind this spectral blade, a whisper of devotion bound in ghostlight. Its edge cuts through both flesh and the veil between worlds, carrying the echo of a love that would not fade.﻿*

﻿Ghostblade has a unique enchantment that resonates with its spectral nature.

Being a spectral blade, it cuts right through the enemy very soul, does raw magic damage, which ignore resistances, it also weakens foes, making them deal less damage.
  
The damage and debuff done to enemies **scale with your enchantment skill**, becoming stronger as it progresses:
  
  
Enchanting level - 0~19:  10 raw magic damage+ foes deal 5% less damage for 10s.
  
Enchanting level - 20~39:  20 raw magic damage + foes deal 10% less damage for 10s.
  
Enchanting level - 40~59:  30 raw magic damage + foes deal 15% less damage for 10s.
  
Enchanting level - 60~79:  40 raw magic damage + foes deal 20% less damage for 10s.
  
Enchanting level - 80~99:  50 raw magic damage + foes deal 25% less damage for 10s.
  
Enchanting level - 100:  60 raw magic damage + foes deal 30% less damage for 10s.
  
  
Defeating a foe that has the weakened effect still active, will bestow you the **Spectral Aura.**

The Ghostblade begins to resonate with your very existence, turning your essence almost spectral.
  
For the **duration of 10 seconds**, you **ignore 50%** of a foe damage resistance, and you also have a **25% chance** of completely ignore attacks against you.
  
  
While you have this Spectral Aura active, defeating a foe that has the weakened effect still active, will bestow you the **Spectral Dominion.**

The Ghostblade now fully resonates with you essence, temporarily turning you into a spectral being.
  
For the **duration of 10 seconds**, you **ignore 100%** of a foe damage resistance, **falling damage is nullified** and you are **completely untouchable by any attacks**.
  
  
Defeating a foe while this effect is active has a **1 in 3 chance** to give you an **ectoplasm**.
  
  
**These effect WORK on followers.**
  
**This weapon CAN'T be disenchanted.**

Travelers that go near **Ansilvund** will sometimes hear soft whispering calling them to the old nord ruin.
