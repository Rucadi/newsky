> *﻿...﻿In Skyrim once lived a young man, not strong, nor intimidating looking, but with a inner fire worth of dozens well trained and dauntless nord warriors. At the beggining of his story, he actually starts as a common man, living a peaceful life, but the ghosts that haunted his memories were too much to bear, which would eventually lead him a personal quest that would forever change his character.
>   
>   
>  ﻿Centuries go by, and the young man who once lived a quiet life in his farm passed into legend, being known as "The Wolf Warrior" in the traditional nord stories, a man, as the legends says, could conjure the ire of ten generations of warriors, but had the calmness and swiftness of a wolf. Running straight into battle, roaring and wielding his legendary sword, Ulfsvar, the "Wolf's Vow".*

If the stories are true, the Wolf Warrior burial sight is inside a cave in the mountains surrounding Solitude.
  
Upon reaching the location, there is also book that also tells in more details the story of the Wolf Warrior.
