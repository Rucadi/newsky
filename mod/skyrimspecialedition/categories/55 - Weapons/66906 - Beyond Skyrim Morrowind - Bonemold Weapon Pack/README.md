In honor of Morrowind’s 20th anniversary, the Beyond Skyrim: Morrowind team has decided to share a special treat: our complete bonemold weapon set!
  
  
To get your hands on these new items, simply travel to **Traitor's Post** in Skyrim and look for an unfortunate mishap on the road.

***Beyond Skyrim: Morrowind: Bonemold Weapons Pack* has no requirements**
  
However, the mod may interfere with any mods that make changes to Traitor's Post.
  
There should be no conflicts or compatibility issues otherwise.
