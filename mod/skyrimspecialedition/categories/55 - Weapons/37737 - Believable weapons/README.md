# Believable weapons

I always liked the style of the weapons in the Elder Scrolls series. The exotic materials, the beautiful artwork. Unfortunately, the weapons in Skyrim are very large and have all sorts of bizarre details. Irregularly shaped edges. Axes bent in weird angles. One-handed swords with grips for three hands.
  
  
This mod changes the shape of most of the original axes, maces, swords and warhammers to make them look like something you could actually use in battle. Not necessarily realistic, but believable.
  
  
All changes are made with great attention to detail, so as not to ruin the original artwork. Textures still look good, blood effects still look good, and collision is still correct.
  
  
  
**Features**
  

  
* 113 reshaped battleaxes, greatswords, maces, swords, war axes and warhammers. The new shapes apply to every instance of the original weapons in the game.
All models are optional. Include the ones you like and forget about the rest.
  
* No in-game stat changes. Only the appearance is changed.
No texture changes. The reshaped models use the original textures, or whatever replacer textures you have installed.
  
* No effect on save files. Install and uninstall as you like.
No effect on performance. The new models have a vertex count comparable to the originals and use no additional textures or effects.
  

  
  
**Installation**
  
Install with a mod manager to conveniently select which models to include. Installing and uninstalling on existing save files is perfectly safe.
  
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
This mod is fully compatible with:
  

  
* other weapon mesh replacers
texture replacers
