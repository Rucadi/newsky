*"...Long ago back in the Third Era﻿, around the same time as Knights of the Nine were dissolved, a new small order began to rise on High Rock, a company of knights who were thirsty for justice against evil-doers of any kind, those honoured individuals would then call themselves The Vindicators.**Only the most trained and honoured knights would be accepted in the order, and eventually, rise as Vindicator paladin, whose sole purpose was to travel around Tamriel and destroy evil in any shape or form.
  
  
To become a Vindicator paladin, the knight would need to take the Oath of Vengeance, a sacred scripture written by Aelius, founder of the order. After taking the oath, the newborn Vindicator would recieve a special blade which was carried by all paladins of the order, a supreme weapon build with the best craftsmanship and materials, not just a tool to slash any foes in the way, but a reminder of the paladin's duty as a Vindicator, to bring merciless justice and punishment to any evil that would walk Tamriel..."*

Nobody knows what led the Vindicators to dissolve after some centuries, few blades are know to have existed and even fewer are cataloged﻿ on personal collections, however at least two of them were preserved in Skyrim.
  
  
One used to be owned by an old resident of Proudspire Manor in Solitude, but oddly enough the blade was confiscated by the Thalmor.
  
  
﻿The other is know to be owned by the Silver-Bloods in Markarth, probably is mantained locked in their vaults due to its high value.
  
  
Lastly but not less important, a book, or small diary, is know to be owned by the Library in Winterhold, it contains some vital historical information on the Vindicators and how their weapons were made. **(Reading the book unlocks the weapons to be crafted in any forge, also requires Steel Smithing Perk)**
