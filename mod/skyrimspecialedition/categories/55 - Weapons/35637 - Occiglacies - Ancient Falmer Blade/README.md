[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]This is my first original mod and I call it Occiglacies or "Killer-Ice" the blade belonged to the ancient Falmer Queen before her presumed death, it was lost when one of the Paladins of the Chantry of Auri-El was fleeing with relics from whilst it was being sieged by the corrupted Falmer!
