[font=Times New Roman]﻿A cacophony of screams echoes from the eerie viridescent glow of the blade, the howls of the damned escaping and oozing out from every crevice and scratch on its ornate surface letting loose a brief glimpse into the unseen world from the weary souls waiting to be felt, to be heard. The weapon appears as an anathema, an uneasy violation of nature as unique and beautiful as it is grisly and macabre
