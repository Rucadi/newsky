This mod replaces the generic, random thane weapons with unique model and enchantments in the approach of Morrowloot's implementation. (No script)
  
Using mostly [billyro](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/1734939?tab=user+files)﻿'s﻿ assets and one battleaxe from ﻿IVoltZ's [Stylish Dwarven Weapons 4K Bronze-like textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33097)﻿. (Open permissions!)
  
  
Yes I know there are already 2 great thane weapon mods [Thane Weapons Reborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8387)﻿ and ﻿﻿[Zim's](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9138)﻿, but I want something new after my 50+ playthroughs with those 2 mods.
  
  
Also I really like billyro's weapons so I use most of his recent works and make them somewhat unique to get.
  
  
The weapons are designed to be balanced for most modded playthrough. None of the weapons have stats that surpass ebony tier.
  
Also if it is a major city thane weapon or it is really hard to be thaned in that hold, it is likely to be stronger or has more powerful enchantment.
  
  
Here are the introduction of the new thane weapons.
  
  
**[size=4]﻿Blade of Whiterun
  
[/size]**Weapon model - [﻿Sarta - Leather Wrapped Sword﻿](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33433)
  
Enchantment: ﻿This sword carries the embers of the Skyforge, each hit deals additional 15/30 points of fire damage.
  
Stats: Equal to vanilla dwarven tier. Upgraded version equal to vanilla glass tier. Increased critical damage.
  
  
Default is a two-handed greatsword. You can reforge into one-handed sword at Skyforge and ﻿vise versa. Requires steel smithing perk.
  
You can upgrade to gilded version of the sword at Skyforge if you have orchish smithing perk.
  
This weapon does not consume enchantment charge so it is a very good early to mid game weapon for warrior characters.
  
The upgrade mechanic is designed to counter the fact that you can get this weapon pretty early on and almost effortlessly, so it won't destroy your game balance and progression.
  
  
  
**Sword of Haafingar (Solitude)**
  
Weapon model - [Knight Sword SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26573)﻿
  
Enchantment: Target takes15 points of shock damage and 10 points of sun damage. Undead takes triple sun damage.
  
Stats: Equal to vanilla glass tier. Increased critical damage.
  
  
Default is a two-handed greatsword. You can reforge into one-handed sword and ﻿vise versa. Requires steel smithing perk.
  
A nice weapon for paladin/knight characters, very effective against undead enemies.
  
  
  
**Black Blade of the Rift (Riften)**
  
Weapon model - ﻿﻿[Swordbreaker SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25039)﻿ (with black metal optional file)
  
Enchantment: ﻿Causes 3 points of poison damage for 15 seconds.
  
Stats: Equal to vanilla elven sword. Faster attack speed but shorter reach than normal swords.
  
  
A very deadly shortsword. Attack damage is not very high but the dot poison damage plus fast attack speed make it a very effective weapon for rogue/thief characters.
  
  
  
**﻿Dwarven Axe of the Reach (Markarth)**
  
﻿Weapon model - [Stylish Dwarven Weapons 4K Bronze-like textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33097) (Battleaxe only)
  
Enchantment: Attacks stagger targets on hit.
  
Stats: Equal to vanilla glass battleaxe.
  
  
The enchantment of this battleaxe is the same with vanilla Windshear (which is removed by USSEP). I tried to implement enchantment cost for it but failed, so I instead nerfed its attack speed to be equal to warhammer. I think it is quite balanced now because you cannot spam attack during the stagger window with the low attack speed. Still a powerful battleaxe for warrior/barbarian characters.
  
  
  
**Ebony Warhammer of Eastmarch (Windhelm)**
  
Weapon model - [Amsvartner Warhammer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31469)﻿
  
Enchantment: 50% chance for each attribute to absorb 25 point of Health, Stamina, and/or Magicka.
  
Stats: Equal to vanilla ebony warhammer. Faster attack speed but shorter reach than normal warhammer.
  
  
The only ebony tier thane weapon. A very strong enchantment make it a powerful warhammer for 2-handed warrior characters.
  
  
  
**Silver Warscythe of Hjaalmarch (Morthal)**
  
Weapon model - ﻿﻿[Velothi Warscythe](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30987)﻿
  
Enchantment: Absorb 20 points of stamina. Does 20 points of stamina damage.
  
Stats: Equal to vanilla glass battleaxe. Faster attack speed (same as WACCF greatsword).
  
  
It is a silver weapon so will do extra damage ﻿against werewolves, werebears, and undead. 
  
Using battleaxe animation and perks. A really unique weapon, especially effective against undead or 1v1.
  
  
  
**﻿Evening Star of the Pale (Dawnstar)**
  
Weapon model - ﻿[Evening Star SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24340)﻿
  
Enchantment: ﻿Target bleeds for 5 points of damage for 6 seconds.
  
Stats: Equal to vanilla glass warhammer. Faster attack speed (same as battleaxe).
  
  
A fast-swinging warhammer that bleeds you enemies, what else do you want?
  
  
  
**Hunter Axe of Falkreath**
  
Weapon model - [Baltimore Weapons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29612)﻿ (the axes only)
  
Enchantment: 30 points of extra damage to Animals.
  
Stats: Equal to vanilla elven/nordic tier.
  
  
Default is a two-handed battleaxe. You can reforge into one-handed war axe and ﻿vise versa. Requires steel smithing perk.
  
I heard you wanted to kill some bears?
  
  
  
**Blade of Winterhold**
  
Weapon model - ﻿[Voam Sword SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20932)﻿
  
Enchantment: ﻿50% chance for each element of fire, frost and shock to do 20 points of damage.
  
Stats: Equal to vanilla glass tier.
  
  
Default is a one-handed sword. You can reforge into two-handed greatsword and ﻿vise versa. Requires steel smithing perk.
  
A pretty nice sword for spellsword character.
  
  
  
**Axe of Whiterun**
  
Weapon model - [Dovah Nord Weapons SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19236)﻿
  
Enchantment: Target takes 30 points of frost damage to Health and Stamina.
  
Stats: Equal to vanilla glass war axe.
  
  
The weapon you get when you re-gain thaneship of Whiterun. Pretty generic but the stats are not bad.
  
  
  
**It is recommended to used it in NEW GAME. But if you want to use this mod on existing game you can use [AddItemMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17563)﻿ or console command to get the corresponding weapons if you are already the thane of any hold.** 
  
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
Other thane weapon mod - Of course not compatible. Technically it may work but why?
  
MorrowLoot Ultimate - MLU has its own thane weapons. Load this mod below MLU and you are good to go.
  
﻿Zim's Immersive Artifacts - Don't use with the all-in-one version of ZIA. If you use modular version don't select thane weapon.
  
Legacy of the Dragonborn - It has Thane Weapons Reborn built-in. Incompatible.
  
  
  
**Recommendation**
  
[Reliquary of Myth - Artifact Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31612)﻿ - A unique, interesting and well-balanced artifact overhaul that covered many unique items in the game. The author is active and constantly updating the mod. Highly recommend it. Also if you don't use any artifact overhaul, my mod's thane weapon will easily outclass most vanilla artifacts.
  
[Unique Items Tweaks - Improved Less Known Artifacts](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33723)﻿ - Shameless plug to my own mod :P. I made this mod to ﻿﻿complement RoM for the time being. Though I believe it will be obsolete once RoM has updated the other unique items in the game. Again, if you don't use any artifact overhaul, my mod's thane weapon will most likely outclass most vanilla unique weapons.
  
[Honed Metal - SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12885) - Let you ask your favorite blacksmith to reforge the thane weapons for you.
  
[Royal Armory - New Artifacts](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6994) + [PrivateEye's Royal Armory - Reforged](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28006) - More unique weapons! Be sure to grab the [balance patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26398).
