This is a standalone version of ElSopa's ﻿[Iron Weapons Redone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52605) iron weapons replacer mod, for those of us who would rather have additional weapons instead of replaced vanilla weapons.
  
  
Esp file has been flagged esl, and doesn't take up an esp slot.
  
  
These new weapons are all called "wrought iron sword/axe/mace/etc" because I thought they looked like wrought iron with their rustic look, and wrought iron is historically the first type of iron used in smithing, before more modern alloys were invented.
  
  
The stats are exactly like vanilla iron weapons, and they're craftable with exactly the same kinds of recipes as vanilla iron, and temperable.
  
  
First, download this mod and install it, it contains the meshes and esp file. This mod comes in two flavors, the main file includes altered leveled lists, so you will find them for sale in stores and used by hostile NPCs and such. Quite a few leveled lists were altered, so you will most likely need a bashed patch, smashed patch or another way of leveled list integration with other mods. These new iron weapons appear about a third of the time as vanilla iron weapons.
  
The optional file includes only the crafting recipes, no leveled list changes, so you will only be able to craft them yourself.
  
  
Then go to the [main mod's page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52605) and download the optional file called "textures only", for the textures. Or you can download one of the other files on that page, but remember to delete the meshes folder, as those meshes will overwrite the vanilla iron weapons, whereas the ones from this mod will not.
  
Remember to give the original mod an endorsement as well.
  
  
All credits go to [ElSopa](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/6960827) for making these models, I simply turned them from replacers into standalone weapons, and added the recipes and added them to leveled lists and such.
