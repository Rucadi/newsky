**FAQ:**
  
  
1) I don't like the stats or it should do more!
  
• You are free to edit the stats of these to whatever you please. Each weapon is un-enchanted so that you too, can enchant it with whatever you'd like
  
  
2) Does this conflict with the original mod?
  
• No, the paths are entirely separate. The textures however are in the same location so that you are not wasting disk space if you have both this & the original mod installed. You can safely overwrite, the textures are the same.
  
  
3) Why only Daggers?
  
• This is the first pack of many to come. Other packs will be released as time goes on, such as one-handed swords, staves, etc. Yes, there will be a compilation at the end.
