DESCRIPTION

  
The statistics for all three weapons are near identical to normal glass weapons, however their respective crafting recipes are different, which
  
is reflected in the higher value of the items. The weapons can be obtained the same way as vanilla glass: console commands, crafting, or dropped as loot if you have the optional leveled list patch installed. Crafting these requires the "Glass Smithing" perk. They begin to spawn on enemies at the same level as regular glass weapons do.
  
  
All files in this mod are *ESL flagged ESP files.* They will not contribute to your plugin limit.
  
  

INSTALLATION

  
Please, use MO2 or Vortex. Click "Mod Manager Download " on your preferred version, then install and enable in your mod manager. Its that easy. If you want the leveled lists patch, repeat the process and ensure that "CrudeGlass\_leveled\_lists.esp" is loaded *after* "CrudeGlass.esp". To uninstall, simply right click and hit "Remove Mod".
  
  
For the replacer addon, download one of the main files, then download the replacer file. Only "CrudeGlass\_replacer.esp" needs to be activated in your load order.
  
  
Please don't do manual installation, but if you so choose, unzip the contents of "Crude Glass.zip" into your Skyrim Data directory. Do the same for "CrudeGlass\_leveled\_lists.esp" if you want the weapons to appear on NPCs. To uninstall, simply delete any file you added from this mod.
  
  
Updating the mod should never cause issues, but please be sure to download new versions of any addons you previously used.
  
  

COMPATIBILITY

  
The base mod is compatible with nearly all other mods. That is, your game probably won't crash due to an issue with this mod. Therefore, feel free to put the base mod wherever you please in your load order, it won't overwrite anything or vis versa. However, any mod that significantly overhauls weapon statistics or crafting recipes may make this mod's items incongruent with the rest of your game.
  
  
The optional leveled list addon is a different story. This will overwrite/be overwritten by any mod that touches the same leveled lists. You will need to either manually patch these conflicts, or use a tool like Wrye Bash to propagate the leveled list changes.
  
  
All plugin files in this mod use ESL header version 1.71, so if you have a game version older than 1.6.1130, you will need to use a separate backporting mod.
