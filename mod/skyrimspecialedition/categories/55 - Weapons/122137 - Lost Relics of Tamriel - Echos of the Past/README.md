**Shimsil**: A Unique Gold and Ebony Shortsword from Morrowind, Once used by the necromancer Delvam Andarys from the town of Mawai. 
  
Used by the Neverine after claiming victory over the necomancer while on a quest for the Tribunal Temple.
  
Enchantment: Bleedshock: Will Shock, Bleed and Soultrap your foes.
  
 (Located: Plunged into a woman's chest on the table in Hob's fall Cave.)

 (Located: Swindler's Den, final chamber next to the dungeon chest.)
  
  
**Soul Sword**: Once used by Cyrus the Restless, Containing the soul of Prince A'tor and once the royal sword of A'tor. It was enchanted by his soul in a failed attempt to resurrect the prince. Cyrus used it during his rebellion against the Imperials. Was later given to the Queen-Regant of Hammerfel.
  
Enchantment: None, It seems like whatever enchantment it once had has faded. Perhaps prince A'tor's soul was finally able to rest in peace.
  
 (Located: Wreck of the Brinehammer, Stuck in a wall between bunk beds.)
  
  
**Hammer of Gahren**: A legendary Dwarven smithing hammer, when paired with its matching anvil it was used to craft weapons and armors of the highest quality, some consitered relics in their own right.

Enchantment: Moonburn, Its flames are especally potent against daedra. (Fire Damage + Bonus damage vs Daedra)
  
  
 (Located: Inside of the shrine of Mehrunes Dagon on the left side of the main chest.)
  
  
**Shade Sickle**: A Daedric artifact once thought to be a normal farming sickle, the Shade Sickle was forged as an offering to Nocturnal. Able to sever the shadows from people, this dangerous artifact's appearance was changed by its time in Nocturnal's realm. Nocturnal's faithful claim it must never be used for necromantic rituals.
  
Enchantment: Night's Chill, Frost and Poison damage.
  
  
 (Located: On the desk of Mercer Frey in his house, next to the Bust of the Grey Fox.)
  
  
**Brush of Truepaint**: An Aedric Artifact, Once used by a painter to create a Painted world. An artifact of Dibella, it is said the bristles are made of Dibella's own hair. The Brush allows the user to create a Painted world, paint things life-sized and bring them to life.
  
Enchantment: None.... I lack the ability to make it usable. 
  
  
 (Located: Temple of Dibella inner Sanctum, all the way at the back, in front of the statuette.)
  
  
**Spear of the Hunter**: One of the lesser known artifacts of the Daedric Prince of the Hunt, Hircine. Once wielded by the Neverine after defeating the aspect of Hircine during the Bloodmoon event on Solsthiem. It is said to be one of Hircine's favored hunting spears.
  
Enchantment: Hunter. Bonus damage to Animals, and drains the target's stamina.

 (Located:  Palace of the Kings, in ulfric's bedroom over his fireplace.)
  
  
**Crosier of Saint Llothis**: Holy relic of the Tribunal Temple, Shaped like a Shepard's crook, the Crozier of Saint Llothis. The Tribunal's Saint of Dyers, Tailors and the Patron Saint of House Dres, Consitered the symbolic moral bridge between the Gods and their Faithful. 
  
Enchantment: Once held an enchantment that harmed the user whenever they used the sacred relic to harm others. But it seems to have faded after the eruption of red mountain. (Actually I could not get the self-damage enchantment to work so I gave up)
  
  
 (Located:  In the center of the temple in raven rock, sticking out of the central pile of bones and ash.)
  
  
**Sanguine Shortbow of Sureflight**: Daedric Artifact of Sanguine, the Daedric prince of Debauchery (Allegidly). Often associated with Sanguine due to its name, and sometimes falsely attributed to the 27 threads of the webspinner a collection of relics associated with Mephala and Sanguine in equal part. It remains unknown of it is truely his artifact, or just a mysterious bow of legend. Partially due to whenever being asked Sanguine claming to be either too drunk, or hungover to remember.
  
 Enchantment: Hangover. Drains the health of the target, and has a chance of making them collapse in a drunken stupor (Short duration paralyze) 
  
 (Located: Inside of the Misty Grove, On the smaller table with the keg of mead. (missable, when doing the quest grab the bow before talking to sanguine))
  
  
Balance: All of the weapons are unleveled, and their damage is meant to range between the mid to late game items of the base game.
  
  
When making this mod I was aiming to fill in some of the gaps of relics, artifacts and other unique items from past games that weren't covered by other mods yet, or by the creation club. I lack the skill to make a proper set of quests for some of the more lofty or important relics in this pack, but I hope the weapons are fun enough for you all.
  
  
Textures and Models all already ran through Cathedral Asset Optimizer, Plugin cleaned, ESL Flagged, and tested. Will most likely not need patches unless another mod completely replaces an interior.
  
  
PS: Forgot to mention, although there is no direct support or patches for the extended weapon types having unique animations, I suggest using either Keyword Compatibility Framework, Object Categorization Framework, or the Weapon Keyword Synthesis patcher. Which will assign the appropriate weapon keywords used by the DAR and OAR animation sets for weapons like Spears, Quarterstaves etc. (Mainly MCO movesets) (but the Synthesis patcher WILL tag Shade sickle as a 1 handed halberd for some reason, So if using that you might have to manually edit the generated patch in SSEdit to remove the keywords it assigns to the Shade Sickle)
