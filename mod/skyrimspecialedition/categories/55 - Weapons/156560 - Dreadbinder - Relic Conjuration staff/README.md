I always found Skyrim's mage gameplay lacking in unique archetype gear. Warriors have their heavy steel, archers and rogues their bows and daggers, while mages are left with staves that serve as little more than props. Inspired by other fantasy games, I wanted a staff that truly empowers its bearer - without getting in the way of casting.

**Meet the Dreadbinder, the first design I created with this idea in mind.**

**FEATURES**
  
  

* **Unique design** - conjuration / witchcraft-inspired visuals with custom mesh and 4K textures.\*
**Passive Bonus 1** - Conjuration spell cost reduced by 30%.
  
* **Passive Bonus 2** - Automatically soul traps all actors in a 100 ft radius (excluding dragons, dwarven automatons and other non-trappable actors).
**Bonus Effects on Soul Trap**:
  
 • Restores magicka based on soul size (up to 50 pts).
  
 • Black souls also restore 50 pts of health.
  
 • If no suitable soul gem is available, releases a 30-pt AoE “soul burst” over 2 seconds in a 30 ft radius (6.66 sec cooldown).
  
* **Ultimate Ability** - Mass Reanimation: reanimates all valid corpses within 100 ft, up to 100 targets (101 with Twin Souls)\*. Consumes all staff charge; recharge requires 5 grand souls.

  
*\*Note 1:* Soul gems in the staff are using your game's black soul gem textures. Any soul gem retexture will affect gems appearance in the staff as well.
  
*\*Note 2:* Mass Reanimation raises every valid target - rabbits and skeevers included - and may affect performance on lower-end PCs.
  
  
Unenchanted version is available at [Staff of Freedom](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/135566) modpage, check it out if you want to put different effect on the staff.

**ACQUISITION**
  
  
A staff of this power is not given freely. Only those who have proven themselves through peril and forged bonds with powerful allies may even begin the path. When it opens, you will embark on an old-school quest with no markers - using only your wits to find the broken shards and restore them to their former glory. I’ll offer a few hints to guide your search.
  
  
*Beyond the veil lies a place where night never lifts and the dead do not rest. Seek the fragments there, but know this - each is guarded by the most powerful among the masters’ bound servants.*

**TECHNICAL INFORMATION AND KNOWN ISSUES**
  
No hard requirements except for the Dawnguard DLC, obviously. But it's a mod for SSE so you have it by default.
  
I guess a soft requirement or a heavy suggestion would be to have a mod like [IED](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62001) for displaying the staff on your back.
  
I used CK 1.5.7 to create the plugin and all its functions - should work on SE 1.5.97 natively.
  
Plugin is ESL-flagged and cleaned with xEdit.
  
Known issue - enlarged inspect in inventory is a bit glitchy (it's when you scroll mouse over a 3D to make it fullscreen inspect), I'll try to fix it later. Maybe.
  
Second known issue - very high price of the staff in septims, it's because of the way how the game calculates the value based on specifics of staff enchantment charge and amount of uses. For balancing reasons it's single use with a huge charge amount, thus the ridiculous price. I'll try to find a way to circumvent this in the future.
  
Also, I'm not aware of any mod that changes the model of black soul gem and replacing textures with new UV set, but if there is - gems in the staff will appear messed up. If that issue will arise - I'll move the gems texture to unique location to remedy that. For now I'll leave it this way to ensure compatibility with mods that simply retexture the gems without changing their UV.
