The Diamond Sword is back for Special Edition! The one for oldrim can be found [here. (click)](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/17668/?tab=2&navtag=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nexusmods.com%2Fskyrim%2Fajax%2Fmodfiles%2F%3Fid%3D17668&pUp=1)   
I've made some updates as noted below.    
v1.1:
  
Updated for Skyrim: Special Edition
  
Removed blood effects on sword. I could not get the blood effects to render on the sword properly, so now you'll always have a clean diamond sword!
  
Reduced specularity on sword so it's not overly shiny in the inventory menu
  
Ported for Consoles
  
   
How to obtain;
  
Crafting [Category - MISC]: Firewood (x1), Diamond (x2)
  
   
OR
  
   
Go into your console, type the following commands
  
help "diamond" (look for the ID of the diamond sword in the list)
  
player.additem <swordID> <amount>
  
   
Enjoy!
