 ﻿﻿"...In the ancient and mystical annals of Tamriel, lies the tale of a weapon forged from the very essence of magic and divinity. In an age where the veils between Mundus and Aetherius were faint and permeable, war and times of great peril were fostering across the lands, as the unknown forces from the Darkness were spreading and destroying great kingdoms and all life in their way, so great was the necessity for this unstoppable force to be mitigated and averted, that divine intervention was sent...
  
  
 ﻿One day he arrived, wearing golden armor with the splendor of a thousand suns, hair white as snow and the eyes that burned with the rage of the aedric beings from above, once here, the aedric entity used his bare hands to sculpt an indestructible spear made of crystal, and in the middle he embedded a pure gem that emmaneted the raw energy from the Aethereal plane.
  
  
 ﻿Leading the great army formed from one the greatest alliances this world has ever seen, and wielding "Gleamstrike" as he called the divine artifact, the great forces from the Darkness were defeated and retreated back to the abyss they came from.
  
  
 ﻿When peace finally came, the unnamed divine warrior left his spear behind, saying that one day Darkness would once again rise and bring destruction to the land, the artifact should be guarded, and when needed, use its power to protect the world..."

Gleamstrike is an ancient artifact of divine origin, a common being can only scratch the surface of its complete potential, but even when held by the most ordinary being can still channel powerful magic from the spear. Its raw power that mainly comes from the Aethereal Crystal, and those versed in the arts of Alteration magic will manage to channel its energy with even more power.
  
  
Gleamstrike starts at Level 1 and can be upgrade 3 times, each upgrade increasing its base damage, how much gleamstrike spells damage scale with alteration. At higher levels of the spear, the base damage scaling of the spear will also increase further.
  
  
Every upgrade on Gleamstrike also grants a new power to your arsenal when the spear is equipped. Upgrading it also slightly changes the weapon's appearence.
  
All powers are marked as "lesser power" so they can be used more than once.
  
  
Information on how to upgrade the spear is provided ingame.

Whispers and rumors along the ages only spoke of an energy surrounding a vast area of Skyrim, perhaps the mysterious Dwemer knew about something in their subterranean city of Blackreach...﻿
