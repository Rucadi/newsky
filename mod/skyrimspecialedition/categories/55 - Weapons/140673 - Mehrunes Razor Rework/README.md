Reworked symbolizes Destruction, Energy, Change, and Ambition Daedric Princes' weapon so it should be more deadly. [size=4](Does not include modifications to the model's appearance, they are other mods)
  
（This mod is ESL marked, no need to take up precious ESP slot）
  
  
  
[/size]• Main changes
  
Item value increased
  
Damage slightly increased.
  
Enchantment charge increased to 10,000 points.
  
  
Enchantment Changes
  
There is a <2%> chance to instantly kill the target. Each attack deals a fixed <15> points of <True Damage> that ignores any resistance, When the target blocks, it will take an additional <30> points of <True Damage> and <True Stamina Damage>, Attacks will reduce the target's armor value by <30> points for <15> seconds.

• New Skills
  
(New skills are used similarly to race powers, or are passive effects.)
  
When you equip Mehrunes' Razor, 3 skills are automatically added to you.

• Blade Of Change: Channel the power of change, infusing it into yourself and Razor, increasing your critical strike chance by <30%>, and causing <Damage Of Change> to inflict 0.3% of the target's maximum health as damage per second for <5> seconds. The effect lasts for <10> seconds. Cooldown time <230> seconds.

• Ambition Mark: Shows the ambition mark. Each attack will mark the target. Each mark will cause <30> points of <True Damage> and last <20> seconds. When the effect ends, a burst of energy will be released. Only the Mark affected by this energy will cause <True Damage>. Cooldown time <150> seconds.

• Destruction Energy: Channel the energy of destruction, infusing it into yourself and Razor, increasing Razor's chance of instant kill to <4%>, and each kill will provide you with a percentage of health, magicka, and stamina based on the target's level for <30> seconds. Cooldown time <180> seconds.
  
  
  
(The cooldown effect of all skills is universal. If the cooldown effect of a skill has not ended, all skills cannot be used.)
  
  
  
  
If you use the Precision Mod, I recommend using the "[Precision magic trails](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120445)", which is where the main colors for my Rework VFX come from.
