The goal of the **Armory Extended** series is to expand on popular mods with new weapon types like Spears, Shortswords, and
  
Quarterstaves, to bring their weapon variety in line with mods like **Heavy Armory** and **Animated Armoury**.
  
Although my mod series is designed to be used alongside the mods mentioned above, they don't require them. You can use this mod **stand-alone** or alongside any weapon pack of your choice.
  
  
Note that this mod **does not add new animations**, and new weapon types will make use of **whatever animation mod you have installed** (as long as they are **compatible with [OCF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81469)﻿**).

This mod adds 6 new weapons to the excellent [Bonemold Weapon Pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66906) by the [Beyond Skyrim team](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/11317178)!
  
  

  
* Adds a (one-handed) Club, Hatchet, Shortsword, Shortspear, Spear, and Quarterstaff.
The (two-handed) Club from the original mod has been renamed to Long Mace and now uses the Bonemold Warhammer model instead. Stats have also been adjusted to match.
  
* The original Bonemold Warhammer model has a new model that’s closer to the Bonemold Mace.

**Patches**
  
The FOMOD installer comes with a couple of patches built in.
  
  
   ﻿- [Heavy Armory](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6308?tab=description) by PrivateEye
  
Integrates this mod into the Full and Lite version framework from Heavy Armory.
  
  
   - [CCOR & WACCF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28608) by Kryptopyr
  
The installer includes a patch for WACCF that also supports CCOR, if it's installed.
  
This patch requires the Bonemold Weapons Pack patch from [Kryptopyr's Patch Hub.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19518?tab=description)The WACCF patch adds various enchanted versions of the new weapons, so a patch for [Thaumaturgy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57138) by SimonMagnus616 is also provided.
  
  
  - [Tamrielic Distribution - Bonemold Weapon Pack Module](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71372)﻿ by TateTaylorOh
  
Implements the new weapons into the module's proxy level lists.
  
The installer also contains an optional patch for Tamrielic Distribution and Heavy Armory that patches some level lists to be consistent with changes from Tamrielic Distribution's BWP module
  
  
 -  [Bonemold in Solstheim - An Integration Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67472) by SiraMirai
  
Adds the new weapons to the level list integration from BIS

**Recommended**I can highly recommend you get these mods as well.
  
  
   ﻿- [Bonemold Armors and Weapons Retexture SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/94859) by Xavbio
  
An excellent retexture of the Bonemold armor and weapons. Works perfectly with my new weapons.
  
  
   ﻿- [Animated Armoury](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35978) by Nickanak
  
Should work fine next to my new Bonemold weapons mod. No patches needed..
  
  
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/YowUk8C.png)**﻿- Will you / can I make a patch for  {INSERT MOD X}?**In general, I am likely to make a patch if it is a mod I use myself, or that's otherwise easy to throw together. But of course, if you want to take things into your own hands and create a patch for any conflicting mod you find, then you are free to do so.
  
  
**- How can I craft Bonemold weapons?**My aim was to stay consistent with the Bonemold Weapons Pack. None of the weapons can be crafted, but can be found in a chest. Check the original mod page for more details.
  
If you need further world integration, WACCF, Tamrielic Distribution and Bonemold In Solstheim all take care of this and patches for those mods are provided.
