The Dragon Cult was a powerful group that ruled Skyrim during the Merethic Era. The Dragon Priests were the rulers of this cult who received immense power from Alduin in return for their obedience. While the Cult has long been defeated, its presence remains in Skyrim. The cities they once built are now ruins scattered across the land, and even in death, the Dragon Priests and their most powerful servants remain a threat.
  
  
This mod adds a new set of powerful Dragon Cult weapons, based on the Dragon Priest dagger and staff.
  
Dragon Cult weapons have a small chance (20%) to spawn on **Ebony-wielding Draugr** (spawning from level 50 on). Before that, starting at level 40, you might also encounter these weapons in loot in Nordic ruins.
  
  
Dragon Cult weapons are comparable to Dragon Bone in damage.
  
The set consists of **a new shield** and **6 new weapons** (Sword, Greatsword, Mace, Warhammer, War Axe, and Battle Axe), while the Dragon Priest Dagger has been renamed to Dragon Cult Dagger, with its stats changed to match the other weapons.
  
If you also install the optional **Weapons Addon**, you might find **4 more weapons** (Club, Glaive, Long Mace, and Trident).
  
  
Glaive and Trident use Greatsword animations and perks.
  
Note that this mod **does not add new animations**, and new weapon types will make use of **whatever animation mod you have installed** (as long as they are **compatible with [OCF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81469)**).
  
  
Dragon Cult Weapons can't be crafted, but they can be upgraded using a Corundum ingot.
  
  
  
This mod currently comes in **2 versions**:
  
One distributes the weapons through **[SPID](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869?tab=description)**, and the other adds them to **level lists**.
  
**Read more under the compatibility section!**
  
  
[line]**Be on the lookout for powerful, unique artefacts!**
  
For every Dragon Cult weapon, there's a small chance it might spawn as a unique, enhanced variant.
  
These are powerful artefacts from the Merethic Era gifted to only the most loyal and powerful followers of the Cult. 
  
Each of these will only spawn once. Once you obtain a specific artefact, it will not appear again.**Look here for details on each available artefact**

This mod makes changes to a few Levelled Lists and some NPCs in Forelhost. Any [USSEP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266) changes have been forwarded.
  
Also fully compatible with [Object Categorization Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81469)﻿!
  
  
  
**SPID and you!**
  
As of version 1.4, this mod comes in 2 flavours: with and without **[SPID](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869?tab=description)** (Spell Perk Item Distributor). **If you use SPID, this mod makes no level list changes**, and you won't require any patches to resolve list conflicts. The new weapons have a chance to be distributed to any Draugr enemies over level 50. Potentially, this means they'll appear on more than just the Ebony-wielding Draugrs as I intended, thus actually slightly increasing your chance of finding them. To offset this, Dragon Cult weapons will no longer appear in loot.
  
And if you don't use SPID, I've got a bunch of patches available for you in the mod installer.

[b]Recommended**I can highly recommend you get these mods as well.
  
  
 ﻿- [Dragon Priests Retexture SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/101101) by Xavbio
  
[/b]As always, I can't recommend Xavbio's retextures enough! The retextures from his mod will apply to the Dragon Cult weapons, and the textures I created for the Unique artefacts are based on his work too!**![](https://i.imgur.com/YowUk8C.png)[b]**[/b]**﻿- Will you / can I make a patch for  {INSERT MOD X}?**In general, I am likely to make a patch if it is a mod I use myself, or if it's easy to throw together.
  
Of course, if you want to take things into your own hands and create a
  
patch for any conflicting mod you find, you are free to do so.**- Will this mod take space in my load order?**All .esp files in this mod are .esl flagged, so they won't take up any space.**- Is it safe to install/uninstall mid-game?**You can install this mod at any time. Uninstalling mid-game shouldn't break anything, but it is generally not recommended!**- Where do I find these weapons?**They only have a chance to spawn on high-level Draugr Death Lords and late-game loot. The weapons can't be crafted.
  
These weapons aren't intended for the early game, so if you just started a new playthrough, it'll be a while before you find them. Sorry!
  
  
**- Will (animation mod X) work with this mod?**It depends. All new weapons in this mod use relevant keywords that match with [Object Categorization Framework (OCF)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81469)﻿. As long as an animation mod is compatible with those keywords, it should work with this mod. This doesn't apply to Draugr enemies unfortunately! There's [Draugr Spear Animation (DAR)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72794), but it doesn't work with the current version of my mod.
