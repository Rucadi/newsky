---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
This mod replaces the appearance of Miraak's sword and staff models, and as of version **1.5:** 
  
  
  
\* 4 Miraak Sword-themed replacers, paired with 4 Staff replacers. Sword replacers only comes in Miraak-themed variants, but has "Animated Eyes" and "No Eyes" option. The staff replacers however only comes in Animated Eyes option.
  
  
  
\* Shortened the length of the sword blades *(I'm so sorry longsword mains)*\* Added Animated Eyes for the swords, scabbards and staffs
  
  
  
\* Has a standalone mod where you can:
  
  
1.) Turn (or Melt) Miraak's Sword and Miraak's Staff in the Skyforge or Aetherium Forge into "Apocryphic Ingot" and "Polymorphic Nuqwood".
  
  
2.) Use the "Apocryphic Ingot" to create the 4 sword variations from this mod, along with the original Miraak's Sword. The 4 variations will be named "**Firstblade**". You can do this in a normal forge.
  
  
3.) You can alter/change the appearance of the 4 sword variations into a "clean" look which sports the appearance of the old variants 2, 3 and 4 from version 1.0 in the forge. These clean variations will be named "**Aevrig Blade**"; you just need a Quicksilver ingot and the variant you want to alter the appearance of in any forge.
  
  
4.) You can upgrade/improve the new variants in the sharpening wheel where it retains the same requirements as to how you upgrade Miraak's Sword.
  
  
5.) The "Polymorphic Nuqwood" is then used in the **Staff Enchanter** to create the 4 staff variants along with the original Miraak's Staff. These 4 variations are named "**Aevrig Staff**".
  
  
6.) In the meantime, you can only have 1 variant each in your inventory per crafting; when you create that variant, it disappears in the forge menu. You can either put the variant in the chest in the meantime or drop it somewhere safe.
  
  
7.) Both the "Apocryphic Ingot" and "Polymorphic Nuqwood" are not consumed in the crafting process.
  
  
  
By default, the standalone models has the animated eye animation embedded into the swords, sheath and staff inspired by the mod "[Miraaks Sword Retextured - Cthulhu Dawn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42736)" by [MudCrabKing](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5083650).
  
  
  
For the textures; some parts use modified vanilla textures. There is an "Alternate Scabbard Texture" option in the installer which changes the color of the sword's scabbard into black.
  
  
  
The rest will be dependent on your vanilla Miraak's sword textures (which is made as a variation of the modified Ebony sword texture), along with your current Miraak's mask texture which is used in the 3rd and 4th sword variations.

**Important notes:
  
  
  
[b]- Please take note that older versions of the mod "[Zim's Immersive Artifacts](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9138)" remove the tentacle whip animation effect of Miraak's sword.
  
  
- Please check first if the vanilla tentacle whip animation of Miraak's sword works for you, as some users reported that some mods such as CGO and Nemesis might interfere with it, causing the animation to disappear / not work at all.**- People seem to have an issue with the ground tentacle animation that is being created by the projectile of Miraak's staff after it hits the floor in SSE.
  
  
--> This mod doesn't touch the said animation, but do let us know if you find / know a fix for that so we can upload them here, or place a link to the said mod page here. Proper credits will be given for the fix.
  
  
**[b][color=#00ff00][b][color=#00ff00][b][color=#00ff00]- Finally, this mod just replaces the appearance of Miraak's Sword and Staff and has nothing to do with the tentacle whip animation when you swing Miraak's sword. Thank you.**[/color][/b][/color][/b][/color][/b][/b]
