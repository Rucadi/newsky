# Unarmed Hotkey

This is a very simple mod that only does one thing, it adds an unarmed weapon to your inventory (adds armor for offhand version), allowing you to assign it to a hotkey. The new weapon/armor unequips anything you have equipped in your hands (including spells). The DualUnarmed version will unequip anything in either hand when equipped, the main hand version will unequip only the players right hand, the off hand version unequips anything in the players left hand. These are entirely separate mods, so you can download only one, two, or you can get all three if you want to have options.  
  
  
I've tested the dual unarmed version on all item types I could find and it **unequips everything EXCEPT torches** (the off hand version will unequip torches).I tried to get torches to work, but I can't figure it out. If there's a high demand for it, I'll try again. I haven't tested the mod on other modded weapons, but I see no reason it shouldn't work. If you find anything that doesn't work please let me know in the comments. 
  
  
Hope this makes it a little easier to start pummeling your enemies. Enjoy!
