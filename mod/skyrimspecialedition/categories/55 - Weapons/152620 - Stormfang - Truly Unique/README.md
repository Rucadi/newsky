> *...A steel greatsword forged with brutal elegance, Stormfang channels the fury of the skies through a gem core pulsing with storm energy. Each swing hums with thunder, and lightning stirs in its wake, crackling along the blade’s edge. Said to be born in the heart of a tempest, the sword thirsts for battle, its power growing fiercer with each clash beneath darkened skies...﻿*

Stormfang now has a unique enchantment and perks.
  
Its damage and critical damage are slightly higher than a steel greatsword.

When equipped, Stormfang bestows the player the "**Storm Aura**" which gives **20% shock resistance**, its magical gem has a sinergy with tempests, when rains and ﻿storms are falling, your damage and Stormfang's enchantment damage is **boosted by 25%**.
  
  
**Power of Thunder:**
  
Stormfang's unique shock enchantment becomes stronger as you progress your **Destruction skill**.
  
  
Destruction level less than 20: 10 shock damage
  
Destruction level between 20 and 40: 20 shock damage
  
Destruction level between 40 and 60: 30 shock damage
  
Destruction level between 60 and 80: 40 shock damage
  
Destruction level between 80 and 100: 50 shock damage
  
Destruction level at or above 100: 60 shock damage
  
﻿
  
Landing hits in your foes will add a counter to your stacks, when reaching **25 stacks**, you let out a **shock explosion** that damages enemies and  you also become enchanted with a **Lightning Cloak** for 30 seconds.
  
  
**(The enchantment does work on followers and other NPC's when they wield Stormfang)**

Reports say that the thunderous power of Stormfang﻿ has been felt in the area of **Brodir Grove** at the island of **Solstheim**, probably being wielded by a reaver.
