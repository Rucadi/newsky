? **Crafting & Tempering**

Each weapon requires different materials and books. The recipes scale silver to ebony and void salts. For hardening, you need the appropriate ingots and perks (in addition to the crafting book, you need to have a perk to create ebonite weapons), keeping a vanilla balance.
