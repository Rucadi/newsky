**Description:**   
   
Lore Weapon Expansion (L.W.E) is a project that aims to expand the available
  
 weapons found in-game via loot and the crafting menu. All of the
  
included weapons are lore based, meaning they are either based on
  
designs found in previous games (with visual upgrades) or based on
  
descriptions/places/characters mentioned in the series lore.
  
   
The new weapons are distributed via leveled lists so you'll come across them
  
 during your adventures, some are also craft-able and can be found in
  
the crafting menu once you have the required perks and all weapons can
  
be upgraded too.
  
   
The Silver weapons also come with the additional silver effect, so the undead will receive more damage.
