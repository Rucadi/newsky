This mod alters the meshes of some Creation Club weapons that I thought were too big and bulky and would better match with Jg1's meshes. This mod only alters the meshes and should be compatible with mods that change weapon stats and textures. The following weapons have been changed:
  
  
Divine Crusader (ccmtysse001)
  
- Mace of the Crusader
  
- Sword of the Crusader
  
  
Civil War Champions (ccffbsse001)
  
- Akatosh's Talon
  
  
Umbra (ccbgssse016)
  
- Umbra
  
  
Dead Man's Dread (ccbgssse031)
  
- Blackwater Blade
  
  
Ruin's Edge (ccbgssse004)
  
- Ruin's Edge
  
  
Ghosts of the Tribunal (ccasvsse001)
  
- Ebony Mace
  
- Ebony Scimitar
  
- Cleaver of St. Felms
  
- Skull Crusher
  
- Hopesfire
  
- Trueflame
  
  
Stendarr's Hammer (ccbgssse006)
  
- Stendarr's Hammer
  
  
Dawnfang & Duskfang (ccbgssse013)
  
- Dawnfang/Duskfang
  
- Bloodthirst
  
  
The Cause (ccbgssse067)
  
- Scourge 
  
- Torment
  
  
Redguard Elite Armaments (ccedhsse003)
  
- Remnant Scimitar
  
  
Headman's Cleaver (ccbgssse068)
  
- Headman's Cleaver
  
  
If you do not have the Creation Club mod or do not want the mesh altered, simply delete the mesh folder in your file manager. This should be most of the Creation Club weapons that I believe need an updated mesh. The only other one that I want to release is Shadowrend in the near future.
