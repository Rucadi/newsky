**[font=bebas\_neuebook]ABOUT THE MOD[/font]**
  
  
Hello, I'm new to modders. I do **3D** modeling and texturing. Skyrim is my favorite game and I thought why not make mods for it.
  
  
This is a Silver Dagger that I created from scratch and this is my first mod for the game. If you liked my mod please Endorse. This will help me understand whether I should make more mods.
