* Overhaul of skyrim's staves giving each staff type and enchantment it's own unique appearance.
Contains all of my past staff mods with improvements and 4 new staff models based on beth's concepts and 2 others.
  
* Uses particle effects to make these staves more visually unique and feel more magical.

Here you can see some of them: Spoiler![](https://i.postimg.cc/kGRGCvnb/ezgif-com-gif-maker.gif)![](https://i.postimg.cc/9Mw3L8ms/ezgif-com-gif-maker-1.gif)![](https://i.postimg.cc/gJyXYKDV/ezgif-com-gif-maker.gif)![](https://i.postimg.cc/VNWmvZxk/ezgif-com-gif-maker-10.gif)![](https://i.postimg.cc/Fz22D0M6/ezgif-com-gif-maker-17.gif)![](https://i.postimg.cc/0Q1KR4p5/ezgif-com-gif-maker-9.gif)![](https://i.postimg.cc/bwKsk5V0/ezgif-com-gif-maker-4.gif)![](https://i.postimg.cc/vBSRxJ3b/ezgif-com-gif-maker-22.gif)﻿

* With all staff models and different crystals + particles combined there's about 45+ variants in total.
These particles also emit light if you have particle lights enabled in your enb settings.
  
* Support for 3DNPC, Lotd, Undeath and a few CC mods.
Remade collisions for all the staves, no more spinning around forever when dropped.
  
* Particles will only show when your character is wielding these staves or has them on his back, they won't show up on display or when dropped on the ground to avoid turning the place into a rave and causing fps drops (Made an optional patch which enables particles on staves when dropped and on display stands, only recommended for screenshot purposes and such, not for gameplay unless you have particle lights turned off in enb).
I tried to make it so each Magic element has 2 models, one for spells which deal damage or are made for fighting in some way and another made for support type spells/enchantments.
  
* Some of them use the same particle effects but they're orb/crystals will look different.
The plugins are espfe's.
  
* Textures are available in 4k 2k and 1k.
More patches are available [there](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65660)﻿.

**Changes made to my past staves:**
  

  
* [size=3]Conjuration, Restoration, Illusion, Alteration staves: updated textures, removed some unnecessary textures, made several changes to the crystals/orbs, made new collisions.
  
Staff of Magnus: Reworked the model from scratch (it has less polys than the previous one i had made but is still higher poly than vanilla), this one has new uv's and textures with hand drawn etchings/details instead of using an upscaled vanilla texture as a base.This new model has 5 options in total based on the eye of magnus option you select.Spoiler![](https://i.postimg.cc/6KFYNW95/Skyrim-SE-2022-02-27-14-04-47.jpg)﻿
  
- Dragonpriest staves: all 3 texture options i had made are available for those who do not want to go through my dragonpriest retexture and there is an additional option to have crystals in the eye sockets of these staves.
Ayleid staff and staff of worms: Replaced enbl node with or added particle effects, made the light source follow the floating gems.
  
**What's new:**
  

  
* Unenchanted staves used for crafting: They have their own nifs with dark orbs/crystals to reflect their unenchanted states.Spoiler![](https://i.postimg.cc/Rh2QZ2Sv/Skyrim-SE-2022-03-25-21-27-42.jpg)﻿
Included a mesh replacer for the enchanting table made with wSkeever's awesome smim'd staff enchanter as a base, there are 4 options in total, you can choose to have the crystals on the enchanter look like they've already been enchanted and are ready for use or you can choose to have these crystals look dark to reflect their unenchanted states, and you can also choose to have gems in the eye sockets of the dragon priest staff to match the option you picked for these.Enchanting table pictures:Spoiler![](https://i.postimg.cc/38GjwGKr/enchanted-with-gem.jpg)﻿![](https://i.postimg.cc/ZbP9gxbN/unenchanted-with-gem.jpg)﻿
  
* Dragon priest staves: Patched the dragon priest load screen, Hevnoraak and gauldur's staves use the dragon priest models to make it a complete set of 4 staves, 2 "gold" and 2 "silver" using each model.(check pictures, if using lotd they'll use lotd's models).
Destruction staves now have their own unique model, they no longer use the dragon priest staff model, it didn't make sense to me that everyone would be running around with dragon priest staves simply because they're casting a destruction spell and this also makes the dragon priest staves more rare and unique rather than appearing all over the place.Spoiler﻿![](https://i.postimg.cc/mRvLMHTf/Skyrim-SE-2022-03-25-15-18-22.png)﻿
  
* The alteration/restoration/illusions and conjuration staves have 2 unique models each, one for spells which deal damage or are made for fighting in some way and another made for support type spells/enchantments.Alteration:Spoiler![](https://i.postimg.cc/hKgKZRJ2/Skyrim-SE-2022-03-25-15-16-45.png)﻿Conjuration:Spoiler![](https://i.postimg.cc/kngq9Nv8/Skyrim-SE-2022-03-25-15-18-05.png)﻿Illusion:Spoiler![](https://i.postimg.cc/QjbhRY1h/Skyrim-SE-2022-03-25-15-17-40.png)﻿Restoration:Spoiler![](https://i.postimg.cc/4spJ1x3K/Skyrim-SE-2022-03-25-15-17-01.png)﻿
Each staff has a unique crystal and/or particle effect based on the spell it casts.Spoiler![](https://i.postimg.cc/B4P8f3ns/Skyrim-SE-2022-03-28-00-21-31.png)﻿

Made a model and texture replacer for the staff Hag's Wrath, similar to Lotd's design but using my skeleton meshes (this means my skeleton replacer is a requirement for this staff, you'll need to grab the textures at least).Spoiler![](https://i.postimg.cc/HWHMsPZ3/Skyrim-SE-2022-03-25-21-48-41.jpg)﻿

**Extras:**
  

  
* Staff of magelight: made a variant in case you'd like it to use the other alteration staff model.Spoiler![](https://i.postimg.cc/rqdkzytZ/Alt-Magelight.jpg)﻿
Made a new unique staff, it's completely separate from the main mod in case you do not want it, it is craftable and has it's own custom model and textures and it's enchantment causes fireballs/meteors to rain down from the sky, it's like the storm call shout but without the storm bit.Spoiler﻿![](https://i.postimg.cc/7D8QjFrz/Skyrim-Special-Edition1035.png)﻿
