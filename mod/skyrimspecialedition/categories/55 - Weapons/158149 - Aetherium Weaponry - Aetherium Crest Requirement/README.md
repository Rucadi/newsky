# Aetherium Weaponry - Aetherium Crest Requirement

This mod is an updated .esp of the [Aetherium Weaponry ESL](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/121323) mod by TheShaqar. It still requires all the original mod's files. This has been balanced around use of [Lorkhan's Legacy - An Overhaul of Magical Mining and Soul Gems](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54737), but another source of Aetherium Crests would work as well. I was making this patch for myself and decided to upload it for everyone else to enjoy as well.
  
  
Changes:
  
- Fixed the issue where Aetherium Arrows were being treated as Daedric Arrows after leaving the bow.
  
- Makes all Aetherium weapons cost one or more Aetherium crests in order to make, depending on item size and apparent Aetherium quantity in the model. Specifically, the sword and greatsword require multiple, as the entire blade appears to be made of Aetherium.
  
- Makes all crafting recipes require completion of Lost to the Ages. This means you need to make one of the vanilla artifacts first, and actually finish the quest.
  
- Makes all tempering recipes require an Aetherium Crest. This is a much more powerful weapon than Dwarven and the cost should reflect that.
  
- Standardizes the vanilla Aetherial Shield along those same rules.
  
- Adjusts the stats to reflect the added difficulty of requiring a quest and an extremely rare resource. In the initial mod, they are not standardized to the same tier, but were generally close to the effectiveness of ebony. I have adjusted and standardized them upwards to be equivalent to Dragonbone. 
  
- All recipes now use the misc. object version of the crest that you will see in your inventory, rather than the invisible weapon version found in vanilla. This is so that you can see the crests after you craft them.
  
  
Requirements:
  
- [Aetherium Weaponry ESL](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/121323) - I have not included any of the assets from that mod here, this is only an .esp update. Overwrite their .esp with mine.
  
- [Lorkhan's Legacy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54737) - This or another source of Aetherium Crests.
  
  
Additional:
  
- A patch between [Lorkhan's Legacy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54737) and [Mysticism](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839) has been included. It is technically outside the scope of this mod, but was worth uploading anyway. This is a basic xEdit patch.
  
  
Compatibility:
  
- This will conflict with anything modifying the Aetherial items crafting recipes
  
- This will conflict with anything modifying the Aetherial shield 
  
- Patches are easy to make 
  
  
Support:
  
If you need patches, want a version using a different Aetherium source (such as ingots from another mod), or whatever else, I will be happy to make them. Please direct any questions about the weapon meshes themselves to the original mod author.
  
The mod has been lightly tested, please report any bugs and I will attend to them when I am able.
