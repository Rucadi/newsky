> *﻿﻿Meridia's Sorrow, A ceremonial crozier thought to be crafted as an offering for the fallen Magne-Ge turned Daedric Prince but it has since been used as a ritual implament in the ceremonies of Meridia's faithful. Known to some as the second daughter of Magnus, The Red Star, Sunfire, The Bright One, and Merid-Nunda. Why the star on the crozier cries tears of blood has been lost to time, but some speculate it may be to depict the sorrow of her fall, perhaps the  loss felt after losing connection to her sisters and father,  or bloodied tears of rage that the undead dare sully the face of Nirn.**Although it has never been elevated to the status of daedric relic, it has remained an important ceremonial piece used by the cults of Meridia since the first era.  The style of craftsmanship seems to be of early Imperial Origin, but wither it was made during the late Alessian order, or early Reman dynasty is unknown, but whenever it was made one thing is certain is that it is ancient.*Excerpt from the "Red Star" Chapter of the book "On the history of the Magne-Ge, Magnus, The five sisters, and Celestials", By imperial historian Arius Stellafilos. (3E, 126)

  
And now this unorthodox weapon awaits your dragonborn.
  
Made of Ebony, Gold, Ruby (?) and leaking tears of blood, this ceremonial enchanted crozier will prove to be useful in your upcoming adventures.
  
  
Suggestions: Is tagged as a battleaxe so use whichever animations or movesets you think fit best for it and includes a 1 handed version in the latest update. But depending on keyword tagging mods used,Or your choice of Quarterstaff Animations/Moveset if using the Animated Armory patch in the Miscellaneous Files. (I personally chose battleaxe due to the enlarged sun-head-thing I used for the blade)
  
  
Misc Files include Animated Armory patch to make it a Quarterstaff, [Requires Animated Armory DAR version and its requirements](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35978) (Just for the patch, main file has no requirements aside from base game)
