*> ...Since the born of the First Empire, skillful warriors have been trained to be ready for everything, in their arsenal, you could find only the highest quality equipment, made by the best smiths in all Cyrodiil. Among those equipments, one could find this peculiar greatsword, a massive long blade usually wielded by the most fearless Elite Knights, those knights preferred to abdicate their shields and go for a more aggressive strategy, similar to the Berserker nordic style. A heavy weapon, but will perform devastating blows...*

The Imperial Elite Greatsword has extended reach, better stagger and critical damage, but is heavier and swings slightly slower than usual greatswords.﻿
  
  
It also features its own upgrade path, going from +0 to +5.
  
**All improving of the weapon is made on forges and anvils**, which will require various materials.
  
**This weapon can't be tempered at a sharpening wheel.**
  
  
However﻿, this weapon has an extra damage scaling with the **"Smithing"** skill, and each upgrade on the weapon increases the scaling capability:
  
  
**At +0: 1.0x scaling
  
At +1: 1.2x scaling
  
At +2: 1.4x scaling
  
At +3: 1.6x scaling
  
At +4: 1.8x scaling
  
At +5: 2.0x scaling**
  
**At +5, the weapon becomes enchantable.**

Since those weapon﻿s were only wielded by the elite of the Empire, an exemplar of this sword can be quite rare, the last time one was seen in Skyrim, was many years ago, being wielded by a knight in **Solitude**, being rarely seen, word back in the day said he was guarding something in the **Temple of The Divines**, rumors said he was guarding an old tomb of some sort.
  
  
SpoilerThe weapon can only be obtained during the **"The Wolf Queen Awakened"** quest, in the first layer of Potema's Catacombs. 
  
  
Upon obtaining the weapon, it becomes available for crafting in the steel category, you also get a journal with a bit more lore to it.
