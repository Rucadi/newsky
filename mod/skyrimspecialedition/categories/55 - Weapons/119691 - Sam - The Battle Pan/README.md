*"...Throughout Tamriel, there are many stories of adventurers seeking treasure, glory and or just personal fulfillment, every story unique in its own way, some of them hateful, sad or happy.
  
  
One of those stories tells the tale of﻿ a breton named Bell, a man passionate by exploring, and during his travels and adventures, he also discovered another passion, cooking!**During his years of travels, he acquired what he called the ultimate cooking tool, an ebony frying pan, along with fine cuttlery. After some time, during a fight against a group of Falmer, his old steel sword broke, and he decided to forge the pan to the broken sword hilt, and by doing this he made the ultimate tool and weapon all in one, and called it Sam, The Battle Pan.
  
  
No one knows what happened to Bell after some years, but some believe he finally met his end during some of his cave dwelling..."*

Some people that knew Bell back in that day said that he went off to try and find a lost dwemmer city underground, but never returned.
  
  
Spoiler Bell's remains can be found behind the main Blackreach city, just by the side of some pipes along with his stuff.
