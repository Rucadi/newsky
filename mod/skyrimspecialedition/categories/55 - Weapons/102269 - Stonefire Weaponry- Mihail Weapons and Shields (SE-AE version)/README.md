***﻿"**In design, the Stonefire weapon set resembles common Dadric Light weaponry, but made of a more rustic metal and adorned with stronger, evil-influenced decorations. Bluish reflections spread across all angles of the weapons, a manifestation of Coldharbour's own Azure Plasm.
  
  
This set is ostensibly used by the Dremora in the service of Molag Bal, and despite resembling the Stonefire Armor set used by them, it contrasts greatly in weight, with the armor set being heavy and even cumbersome, and the weapons being light and practical. Despite appearing heavier, their weight and strike speed are similar to common Daedric Light weapons."*

A former monster hunter, now a dedicated scholar, he is planned to be released as an NPC in late 2022/early 2023, doing the same job in-game as my descriptions do on Nexus.)
  
  
  
  
Tecnhical info: 
  
  
This set has stats similar to Nordic weapons and shields added by the Dragonborn DLC (not to be confused with the inferior Ancient Nordic weapons used by Draugrs). However, due to its rarity and origin, they have a price similar to that of ebony. Unlike Nordic Shield, however, Stonefire Shield has light armor stats. Due to their design, they tend to be, for the most part, faster than heavy daedric weapons. All equipment can be forged with the daedric perk, including non-enchanted staffs, which can be enchanted in the staff enchanters added by the Dragonborn DLC. The set can be upgraded as well.

So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)
