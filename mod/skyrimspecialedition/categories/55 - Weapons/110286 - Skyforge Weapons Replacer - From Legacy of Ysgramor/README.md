Replaces the 5 vanilla Skyforge weapons using models from NordwarUA's [Legacy of Ysgramor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/109963?tab=description) mod.
  
Version 2.0 also adds a Skyforge Steel Shield, which can be purchased from Eorlund and is also carried by Skjor.
  
  
The leather features of the weapons have been darkened to match more closely with the vanilla wolf armor.

Legacy of Ysgramor is not required, and no other changes from that mod are carried over.
