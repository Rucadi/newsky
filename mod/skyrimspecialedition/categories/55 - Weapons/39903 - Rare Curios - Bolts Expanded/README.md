**Rare Curios - Bolts Expanded:**
  
  
My main aim here was to carry over the vanilla crafting requirements and upgraded elemental bolts and then provide balancing against the relative power levels of the vanilla arrows. Please see the images for examples of how they look in-game next to their respective crossbows from other Creation Club content. Crafting of dwarven bolts and higher tiers require the ability to craft Dwarven Crossbows, with the exception of Improved Bonemold.

**Crossbow Integration Addon:**
  
  
This file goes one step further, making crossbows and bolts an accessible, albeit still uncommon, weapon option. [Durak's Crossbow Conversation 2 RETRIBUTION](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58331) is *heavily* recommended. The following general changes are made:
  
  

  
* All standard crossbows and bolts only require their relevant smithing perk and are visible to craft when the perk is obtained with no Dawnguard involvement.
All Enhanced Crossbows are unlocked following completion of the first run of Ancient Technology.
  
* The total run count for Ancient Technology has been reduced to 4 due dwarven crossbows no longer being locked and the enhanced variant being unlocked by the first run. Sorine will correctly recognise that the run for Shock bolts will be the last.
Elite Crossbows' quest has been removed and the Ironback Hideout repurposed as a respawning radiant enabled Silver Hand outpost with relevant loot changes.
  
* Expanded Crossbow Pack's distribution now includes bolts from Rare Curios Bolts Expanded and will distribute only to Fletchers.
Imperial Soldiers may rarely have Imperial Crossbows and Steel Bolts.
  
* Silver Hand archers may sometimes have Silver Crossbows and Silver Bolts.
Lower end Crossbows have had their damage adjusted so that all weapons deal 10 more damage than their equivalent bow.
  

  
**Optional Addons:**
  
**Sorine Sells Silver** - Adds Silver weapons and bolts to Sorine's inventory.
  
**No Base Silver Crafting** - Disables base recipes for Silver Crossbows and Silver Bolts in line with base game's Silver Sword and Greatsword. They can still be upgraded into their enhanced versions.
