> *...﻿There exist many types of Daedra, seeking various ways to spread their influence, be it in raw demonstration of strength, spreading fire and destruction, or twisting the mind of their victims beyond comprehension, until they fall in their knees and pledge their souls to their masters. But some of the Daedra came up with some more...unorthodox ways to disseminate their presence in the land.
>   
>   
> Of course I refer to the Mistress of Decay, Namira herself, one of the most ancient beings in existence, her rot, her very darkness, is present in the most dark and forgotten places in all Tamriel. She bathes and adores all things repulsive, and nothing is more repulsive than one of the worst acts one can partake...canibbalism.
>   
>   
> Namira uses one of the greatest taboos on our society to gather more followers, but why? According to some of her worshippers, to eat the flesh of your similars requires the greatest courage, those who are weak in the mind and fear are not fit to be among her followers. To abandon your humanity, is to abandon all your fears and weakness, to embrace your own decay, is to embrace Namira in your soul.
>   
>   
> One day, one of her followers forged a crude greatcleaver, which he used to chop his enemies apart and extract their freshly death meat, a weapon so nasty in nature that one day it got the attention of Namira, and she spreaded her rot in blade, blessing it for any of  her champions for generations to come. In the blade, the carvings read:
>   
>   
> "Death is her feast...Rot in her grasp"...*

Namira's Maw is not just a tool to carve the meat out of your foes, it can bestow various powers and abilities to those who consume humanoid flesh, specially when wearing the Ring of Namira.
  
  
**Embrace of Decay:**
  
  
Grants you 10% extra damage with Namira's Maw if using the **Ring of Namira.**
  
  
When using the **Ring of Namira**, grants you 10% extra damage against worshippers of Arkay, but they also cause 10% more damage against you.
  
  
**Body Harvest:**

﻿Hitting dead humanoid bodies will extract human flesh, with a 10% chance of extracting a human heart. (Only 3 flesh can be extracted per body).
  
  
But if you are wearing the **Ring of Namira**, hitting dead humanoid bodies will extract cursed human flesh and cursed human hearts instead.
  
those cursed body parts are used to be consumed and acquire stacks, which will grant you various buffs.
  
  
see below:
  
  
**Cursed Human Flesh grants you 1 stack**, **Cursed Human Heart grants you 2 stacks.**
  
  
**At 30 stacks:** 50 Health bonus and +25 damage for Namira's Maw
  
  
**At 60 stacks:** 50 Stamina bonus and +25 damage for Namira's Maw
  
  
**At 90 stacks:** 20% Health Regen bonus and +25 damage for Namira's Maw
  
  
**At 120 stacks:** 20% Stamina Regen bonus, -10% Power Attack cost and +25 damage for Namira's Maw.
  
  
**At 150 stacks:** **Namira's Feast** (lesser power, voice equipped): Invoke a circle of death that deals fear to most enemies, make them sluggish, causes high damage and decreases their damage and damage resistance by 10%.
  
  
**(After consuming the necessary stack amount, just re-equip the weapon to apply the effects)**
  
  
**Namira's Rot:**
  
  
For no enchantment cost, Namira's Maw causes fear, slowness to targets, also reduces their damage and damage resistance by 10%, having the **Ring of Namira** equipped casts a stronger version of this spell.
  
  
**New Food:**
  
  
Of course, a follower of Namira should know good human flesh recipes.
  
Along the weapon, you will find two books, one talks about the weapon itself, the other will teach you 3 new recipes when read!
  
  
**Gourmet Human Beef:** Heals 100 points of Health and Stamina, fortifies Two Handed for 3 hours.
  
  
**Gourmet Heart and Clams:** Heals 100 points of Health and Stamina, fortifies Block for 3 hours.
  
  
**Gourmet Human Soup:** Heals 50 points of Health and Stamina, fortifies Health Regen for 1 hour. (This recipe provides 4 soups!)
  
  
**Having the Ring of Namira equipped will boost the healing values of those items by 50%.**

Such revulsive artifact could only be found at the Shrine of Namira, gossip across Skyrim says that maybe some strange folk gather around some cave ﻿in The Reach to perform vile rituals...

**This weapon can only be obtainable after advancing some steps into the quest "The Taste of Death", after the Shrine of Namira becomes available.**
