**Promotion****and Friends**
  
**What this mod includes**I added a new sword and greatsword to the game named Penitent, which is basically Auriel's sword. Yes, it's compatible with the retexture of Auriel's bow and shield!
  
  
The location of the echanted version is the same as Auriel's shield.
  
There is an unenchanted version of each version that can be crafted at any forge with the elven perk.
