Enchantment charge increased to 10,000 points.
  
  
Enchantment Changes
  
Collects <10> Dreams from sleeping targets. When equipped with the right hand, consumes <5> Dreams to deal <50> <True Damage> and cause stagger. If not enough, it only deals <20> damage. When equipped with the left hand, consumes <5> Dreams to clone the target's Corrupted clone, which can deal 1.5 times the damage for <30> seconds. Every <10> Dreams provides <10> magicka and <5%> Recovery Speed ​​(up buff to <200> Dreams). Regardless of the left or right hand, the affected target has a chance to fall asleep and allow once Dream to be collected. Current Dream: <x> points. When the Skull of Corruption is in your inventory, sleeping will cause your Dreams to be drained, negatively affected.
  
  
(You can only use cloning on humanoid enemies, otherwise nothing will happen. The cloning mechanism is relatively simple, and it is impossible to completely restore the appearance of the NPC, and there are even many discrepancies. However, this is a compromise on performance, and I still don't know how to write a simple, high-performance script that can completely restore the appearance.)

• Corrupted Will: Release a nightmare ball, consuming a positive integer number of dreams less than or equal to your target's level to corrupt it, forcing it to fight for you, and put a Corrupted Crown on the corrupted target, making the target's attacks with weapons carry <30> points of true damage, and become less afraid of imbalance, lasting <120> seconds. If you fail to corrupt the target, the dream will be returned. Cooldown <200> seconds.
