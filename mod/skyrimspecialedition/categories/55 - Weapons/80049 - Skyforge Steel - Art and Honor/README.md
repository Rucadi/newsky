Skyforge steel weapons are a neat set with cultural relevance to the Companions and indirectly Nord culture in general. They're also visually identical to steel weapons, and the set is incomplete and uncraftable.
  
  
**Visual Tweaks**
  
This mod slightly alters the appearance of Skyforge steel weapons. The weapons are clearly similar to steel weapons and fit into the game's existing artstyle, but are also identifiably distinct at a glance. The slight copper hue should make the weapons pair with the Companions' wolf armor set, and reflect the corundum used in Skyforge steel and similarly advanced steel armors.

**Crafting**
  
Additionally, the Skyforge steel set has been completed. The missing mace, warhammer, bow, and arrows have been added. All Skyforge steel weapons can be created at the Skyforge with the Advanced Armors perk after completing Proving Honor, or with the appropriate modded perk whenever Eorlund begins selling Skyforge steel weapons with your modlist.
