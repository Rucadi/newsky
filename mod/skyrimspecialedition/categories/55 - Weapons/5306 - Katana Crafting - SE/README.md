Spoiler
  
  

  
* **Katanas** are of speed [color=#fff2cc]1.125 vs. regular sword speed of 1.000, with -1 to base damage [/color](exceptions: iron, silver and steel don't have -1 to base  damage due to balance).

Critical Damage value of the weapons is not lower, only base damage. Some variants have higher critical damage than their regular sword counter parts.
  
*(Base dame e.g.: a [i](non tempered)* Steel sword has base damage of 8, a Daedric Sword has 14)
  
[/i]
  

  
* **Katanas** are classified as 1-handed swords.
**Dai-Katanas** are classified as 2-handed swords.
  
* **Wakizashis** are classified as 1-handed swords.
**Tantos** are classified as daggers.

**[size=4]NOTE!
  
  
All the models use whatever textures you are using for your regular weapon variants!
  
  
I highly recommend installing texture replacement mods or other HD texture packs.

**A bit of lore:**
  
  
Spoiler
  
  
- The katana type weapons in TES originate from the very first game, and have been present in every game since but only in their Akaviri basic form after Morrowind.
  
  
In Arena and Daggerfall, they came in all available materials, including mithril (which also has made it's last modern appearance in Oblivion).
  
  
  
- Because the Dai-Katana has been called that, and not Nodachi/Ódachi that is what I also call them, it is a tradition.
  
  
- The katana weapons of TES universe are the invention of the people of Tsaesci of Akavir.
