The goal of the **Armory Extended** series is to expand on popular mods with new weapon types like Spears, Shortswords and Quarterstaves, to bring their weapon variety in line with mods like **Heavy Armory** and **Animated Armoury**.
  
Although my mod series is designed to be used alongside the mods mentioned above, they don't require them. You can use this mod **stand-alone** or alongside any weapon pack of your choice.
  
  
Note that this mod **does not add new animations**, and new weapon types will make use of **whatever animation mod you have installed** (as long as they are **compatible with [OCF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81469)**).

This mod adds many new weapons to the Creation Club content: Saints and Seducers, which is free base-game content since 2021.
  
On top of that, I have added support for the excellent [Skyrim Extended Cut: Saints and Seducers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72772)
  
  

  
* Adds **37 new weapons** to the **Golden**, **Dark**, **Amber**, and **Madness** weapon sets.
All new weapons can be found on enemies, in loot, and can be crafted with the same restrictions as other weapons from S&S.
  
* The **Skyrim Extended Cut** patch also adds **5 new Grummite weapons** and many enchanted weapon variations.

**Required** 
  
  
**- Saints & Seducers**
  
Obviously, you'll need this CC content for the mod to work. It's part of the base game for any post-2021 versions of Skyrim, so you already have it installed.

**Patches**
  
The FOMOD installer contains patches for the following mods:
  
  
- [Amber Refossilised](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51529) by Jelidity
  
  
- [Golden Saint Armory Revamped](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77065) by AlbinoWalrus
  
Also, be sure to get [Golden Saint Armory Revamped - Consistency Patches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/124132) !
  
  
- [Grummites](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46526) / [Grummite Weaponry](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46354) / [Daedra Pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/159364) by Mihail
  
Personally, I wouldn't recommend using SEC and Grummite Weaponry together, since they add different copies of the same Grummite weapons. Still, if you insist, I added a combo patch between both mods and Armory Extended.

Requires [Sound Record Distributor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77815)﻿
  
  
- [WACCF & CCOR](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28608) by Kryptopy

**Recommended**I can highly recommend you get these mods as well.
  
  
   ﻿- [Heavy Armory](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6308?tab=description) / [Animated Armoury](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35978)﻿
  
As I mentioned above, these mods are not required, but share the same design philosophy.
  
 Both packs come with new animations that fit the new weapons added by Armory Extended.
  
In the case of Animated Armoury, make sure you also install [Injected Animated Armoury](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74737)﻿ to make sure the animations are compatible.
  
  
- [Skyrim Extended Cut: Saints and Seducers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72772)
  
I strongly recommend you get this mod, because it greatly expands on Saints & Seducers and adds more Shivering Isles content.
  
As a bonus, Armory Extended also adds Grumite weapons, so you'll get even more content out of my mod!
  
  
 ﻿- [Saints and Seducers Retexture SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/151116) by Xavbio
  
As always, I can't recommend Xavbio's retextures enough! A small consistency patch is now available with his mod.
  
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/YowUk8C.png)**﻿- Will you / can I make a patch for  {INSERT MOD X}?**In general, I am likely to make a patch if it is a mod I use myself, or if it's easy to throw together.
  
Of course, if you want to take things into your own hands and create a patch for any conflicting mod you find, you are free to do so.
  
  
**- How can I craft the new weapons?**You can obtain them the same way as all weapons from Saints & Seducers. They're found on cultist NPCs and can be crafted with the same requirements.
  
If you use Extended Cut, you'll find these weapons spread throughout the new worldspace.
  
  
**- Will (animation mod X) work with this mod?**It depends. All new weapons in this mod use relevant keywords that match with [Object Categorization Framework (OCF)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81469)﻿. As long as an animation mod is compatible with those keywords, it should work with this mod.
