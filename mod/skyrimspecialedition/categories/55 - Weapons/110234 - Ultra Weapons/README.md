1. Ultra Weapons now add over 110 weapons in total — more than 80 base-material weapons and over 30 unique weapons.
  
  
2. Rebalanced all Ultra Weapons (slightly increased attack speed so animations don’t look like slow motion, and reduced abnormally high base damage).

4. Updated most unique weapon effects, designs, and enchantment descriptions.
  
  
5. All unique weapons can now be crafted at the Skyforge (no smithing perk required, but a key item material is needed for the recipe to appear).
  
  
6. Added exclusive sound effects for ultra weapons (sourced from Elden Ring).
  
  
7. Added upgraded axes for base materials, and ll series weapons can now also be upgraded at regular forges.

[ Ultra Greatsword ]
  
  
It is exactly the same as the Ultra Great Sword Mode, but finally 's' has disappeared in the name.
  
  
The longest rich and damage is powerful but slow.
  
  
  
  
[ Giant Mace ]
  
  
 This is a huge hammer with a monster hunter style short handle.
  
  
Rich is the shortest, but the attack speed is fast, so it has the best DPS and is heavy.
  
  
  
  
[ Colossal Axe ]
  
  
Appropriately balanced between UGS and JM weapons
  
  
And the lightest and most critical hits are fatal compared to other weapons.
