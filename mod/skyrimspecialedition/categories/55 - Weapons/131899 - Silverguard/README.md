> ﻿...Many are the monsters that walk this plane, of all types, origins and sizes, some are more vile and gruesome, like the blood-sucking night spawns of Molag Bal, the vampires, or the moon night hunting werewolves, torning apart their prey mercilessly, other not so violent but still dangerous type of beings are the undead, being them draugr, skeletons or ghosts, many unsuspecting adventurers have felled victim to these while exploring the obscure nord dungeons of Skyrim for example.

>  ﻿Throught the history of this world, many people organized themselves to fend these beings away to protect the weak, in recent history, a skillful group of witch hunters was most succesful in their quest to destroy those creatures and clean the land from their vile purposes, among their ranks, one individual acquired fame for his work(or her?), nobody really knew the true identity of this individual under the mask. This person was known to have carried around a special silver greatsword, which was called Silverguard, it was a hunting tool like no other ever seen.

Silverguard is a paragon among the night creature hunting weapons, and will display its full powers at the hand of the right wielder.
  
  
**Silver Purity:**
  
  
Upon equipping the greatsword, you will be granted a special perk that gives you 20% extra damage for the sword while against undead, vampires and werewolves.
  
  
But if you are a vampire or werewolf, having the weapon equipped will also make you take 10% more physical and magical damage.
  
  
**Silver Edge:**
  
  
Hitting any undead, vampire and werewolf, the sword activates its special power for a duration of 30 seconds, which will burn **other enemies** with **15 normal fire damage**, but will burn those **specific foes** with **40 silverfire damage.**If you are a vampire or werewolf, having this effect active **will burn you for 5 Silverfire damage per second** while de effect lasts.
  
  
Slaying those same foes while having this effect on, will grant you 1 stack, when reaching 4 stacks, the next time you activate this power, instead of "Silver Edge", the greatsword will activate its stronger version, **"Silver Cipher"**.

Some hunters in the wilds reported seeing someone carrying a fine looking greatsword going towards **Gallows Rock**, maybe it fell on possesion of the Silver Hands, perhaps its leader has it or knows something﻿ about the weapon.
