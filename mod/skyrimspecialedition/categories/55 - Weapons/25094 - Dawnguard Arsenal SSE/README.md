The Dawnguard.  Skyrim's last best hope against the Volkihar Clan menace.  They have a variety of specialized tools of the trade.  However, this arsenal seems... incomplete.  They have a Crossbow, a War Axe, a War Hammer, and a small collection of Sun Damage spells.
  
  
This mod aims to expand their arsenal.  The melee weapon set is now complete, the Sun Damage spell is now nearly as complete as the main line Destruction spells, and the arsenal is now doled out to the named Dawnguard members as well.

\* Dawnguard blade weapons.  These were made from scratch.  A dagger, arming sword, and greatsword, each at Dwarven tier base damage like the two original Dawnguard melee weapons.  They all have the Dawnguard emblem on the hilt, and Arkay's braided knot on the pommel.
  
  
\* Dawnguard Battle Axe and Battle Hammer.  There is now a 2H axe, and in place of a mace is now a 1H hammer, both made from splicing together parts from the existing 1H axe and 2H hammer  When all you have is a Dawnguard Battlehammer, every vampire looks like a nail.  These weapons have been interspersed to a few weapon racks in the fort.
  
  
\* Dawnguard melee weapon special damage has been improved.  Instead of a measly +5 damage against only vampires that is easily outdone with plain Silver weapons, it now behaves like Silver weapons (with +20 damage against a wider variety of unnaturals).  Against vampires in particular, it has more stagger power (except daggers which never had stagger power to begin with) and inflicts a bleed effect.
  
  
\* Dawnguard weapons are now craftable, and have "Elite" versions available as well, boosted up to Glass-tier.  These can only be forged at the Dawnguard smithy.  Compatibility version with Ars Metallica is available.
  
  
\* Sun damage spells are fleshed out and added to Florentius's and Sorine's inventory.  In addition to the original Sun Fire, Vampire's Bane, and Stendarr's Aura, there are now the following:
  
\*\* Sun Ray: The piddly little Novice concentration/spray spell. Instead of halved cost as is typical with the Sun damage spells, it instead does double damage.
  
\*\* Meridian Rune: Granted by Meridia, the Daedric Prince of Light, this proximity explosive rune burns undead but nothing else.  Hey, the Dawnguard takes whatever help it can with the Vamprie menace.
  
\*\* Holy Ground: The hazard spray spell.  Bless the ground so that beings profaned by undeath walk upon it and are harmed.
  
\*\* Gaze of Arkay: The big daddy master spell.  Unleash a torrent of sun damage in a manner not unlike Lightning Storm. Affected targets will flee in terror at the divinely blessed onslaught when hit.  It'll be available at the same time as Expert-level Restoration spells.
  
  
\* Existing sun damage sound effects have been adjusted to be more appropriate.
  
  
\* Several Dawnguard members have been uprated:
  
\*\* Isran should now sport proper heavy armor, and his warhammer has been replaced with a new Greatsword.
  
\*\* Sorine should now start with a Dwarven (standard) Crossbow and some steel bolts.
  
\*\* Gunmar should now have a Dawnguard Battlehammer once he joins up.
  
\*\* Florentius will now have robes that don't clip with his armored boots/gauntlets, and will get rid of his junky iron sword for a Dawnguard sword. He's also sporting a repertoire of Sun damage spells.
  
\*\* Many other less prominent members have had armament switcheroos as well.
  
\*\* Ideally, these will work with a New Game.  However, I have made a retroactive script that should effect these changes as well.  Much of the aspects on the NPCs in question that I altered may be baked in data in the save.
  
  
\* Dawnguard armor only now requires the body, gauntlets, and boots to gain the Dawnguard vampire-resistive set bonus. 
  
  
DAWNGUARD ARSENAL SSE IMPROVEMENTS:
  
\* Blade texture sets now have a higher-res normal map. Packed DXT5/BC3 because BC7 did different kinds of compression artifacting that were more noticeable than DXT5's.
  
\* De-LARP-ified 1H Dawnguard Axe now included. Should I ever release my old De-LARP-ification mod, then just let this or the other overwrite each other because they'll be identical.

Unpack the ESP module and BSA archive into your Skyrim Special Edition/Data folder and activate.  If you use the latest version of Ars Metallica, it is strongly suggested to use the compatibility patch, have Dawnguard Arsenal load after Ars Metallica, and the patch load after both.
