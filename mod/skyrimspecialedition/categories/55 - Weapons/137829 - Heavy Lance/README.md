"Colossal One-Handed Weapons Inspired by Monster Hunter Lances"
  
  
Originally developed in the High Rock region, these weapons were designed for mounted charges, featuring an extraordinary size. Over time, they were adapted by powerful warrior cultures to be wielded one-handed.
  
  
While they lack the devastating charge damage from horseback, their immense reach and swift attack speed make them incredibly effective in one-on-one combat, allowing skilled warriors to dominate their opponents. Experts even use them with shields, earning the nickname "mobile fortresses."
  
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
This mod introduces massive one-handed weapons inspired by Monster Hunter lances. Their base damage starts comparable to daggers of the same material, with attack speed similar to one-handed swords. However, as you upgrade to higher materials, their damage approaches that of one-handed swords while maintaining their exceptional reach.
  
  
If no custom animations are applied, the weapons are treated as one-handed mace by default.

Recommended Mode
  
  
**[Immersive Equipment Displays](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62001)** - Heavy lances can be adjusted to be carried on the back instead of the hip, making them highly recommended.
  
  
[**Precision - Accurate Melee Collisions**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72347) - Highly recommended for creating precise collision distances.
