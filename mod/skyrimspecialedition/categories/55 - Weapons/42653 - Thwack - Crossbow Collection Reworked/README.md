[left]The crossbow is one of my favorite weapons in Skyrim, the design is super cool and they're just a blast to use. So I was excited to pick up the beautiful new crossbow variants that Anniversary Edition has on offer. However, I was disappointed when I saw how they are integrated into the base game. In Expanded Crossbow Pack you just buy them from the Solitude Fletcher and in Elite Crossbows you just walk into a room and grab the Ebony Crossbow off the table!
  
  
This mod seeks to rectify this mishap and integrate the new weapons into the game as seamlessly as possible. The new high-level crossbows will now be a reward given to you at the end of the final Ancient Technology quest. You will be directed to retrieve schematics from the Ironback Hideout, in doing so will also trigger The Night Hunter. After completing both Ancient Technology and The Night Hunter you will be able to craft the new crossbow variants (assuming you have the proper perks).

The Night Hunter quest is preserved in it's entirety and is tied into Ancient Technology.
