loved this mod when it came out on MCO but it is not compatible with BFCO out of the box so I used MCO to BFCO Converter by Sukezzzzz and DAR to OAR Converter by allycat1031 and V3kta to fix/update it. Also Added key word so for thouse of you useing SkyUI and SkyUI Weapons Pack or the merged version with equipment slot the spear icon will be displayed in the menu instead of the battel axe.
