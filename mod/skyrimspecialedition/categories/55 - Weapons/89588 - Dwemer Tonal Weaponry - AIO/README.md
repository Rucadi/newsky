This mod allows you to construct an ancient Dwemer weapon using the art of tonal magics to draw forth blades of energy with which to annihilate your foes. Eight different colour blades (with differing powers) are available at 4 tiers of damage. As a weapon built on the Dwarves' unique tonal architecture, it is not Smithing which dictates your skill in crafting the weapon, instead it is your knowledge of Enchanting alongside other schools of magic that open up more powerful versions of the weapon. The tonal smith pours this knowledge into a soul gem, empowering the weapon with enchantments that do not fade with use.
  
  
This combines my previously created Tonal weapons mods, allowing you to create a Tonal Sword, Glaive (Battleaxe), Daikatana (Greatsword), or Twinblade (Greatsword)
  
  
You start by crafting a Basic Tonal weapon at a forge, from a single Dwemer Metal Ingot and an empty Common Soulgem. You can then upgrade this weapon into the different archetypes/colours with a *Filled* Soulgem. When you meet the Enchanting level requirement you can then convert the weapon into a (White) Enhanced/Superior/Ultimate tier weapon with a stronger empty Soulgem, and then an equivalent filled soulgem to apply the archetype. 
  
  
**Tier Requirements**
  
Basic - no requirement
  
Enhanced - 40 skill level in Enchanting, Greater soul gems
  
Superior - 60 skill level in Enchanting, Grand Soul gem
  
Ultimate - 95 skill level in Enchanting, 3 Grand Filled Soulgems
  
  
**Archetypes**
  
Basic, Enhanced, and Superior tier weapons can be adapted with effects similar to weapon enchantments but without needing to be recharged, and give the weapons at these tiers their unique colours.
  
  
[size=3]**BLUE/SHOCK TONAL BLADE** - imbued with lightning to deal additional damage to health and magicka.
  

  
* [size=2]Requires Destruction level 25/50/75
  
[/size]
  
**ORANGE/FIRE TONAL BLADE** - imbued with fire to deal additional damage to health.
  

  
* [size=2][size=2]Requires Destruction level 25/50/75
[/size]
  
[/size][/size]
  
**TEAL/FROST TONAL BLADE** - imbued with ice to deal additional damage to health.
  

  
* [size=2]Requires Destruction level 25/50/75
  
[/size]
  
**GREEN/POISON TONAL BLADE** - a vile blade delivering additional poison damage with every strike.

[/size]
  
**YELLOW/SUN TONAL BLADE** - a holy blade harnessing light to deliver extra damage to the undead

* [size=2][size=2]Requires Destruction and Restoration level 25/50/75
[/size]
  
  
**PURPLE/MYSTIC TONAL BLADE** - channels your knowledge of mystic binding, benefiting from extra damage as well as soul trapping, banishing daedra and turning undead, with the relevant perks
  

  
* [size=2][size=2][size=2]Requires Mystic Binding perk
[/size][/size]
  
[/size][/size][/size]
  
**ULTIMATE TONAL BLADES**
  
One you reach 95 in Enchanting, you can upgrade any Superior tier Tonal Blade to an Ultimate tier with 3 filled Grand Soul gems. As an expert in Tonal architecture, you abandon any reliance on other schools of magic, and instead imbue a blade with it's own unique power. These blades deliver chaos damage (50% chance to deliver additional Fire, Frost or Shock damage - potentially all three!) as well as absorbing stamina from who them strike. The white blade can then be converted into any of the other colours without the need for additional material. You're a master tonal architect now, you can choose your own glow.
  
  
  
  
**Added in v2.0 - Tonal Bow**
  
Version 2.0 has added a new weapon - the Tonal Bow. Crafting upgrades and enchantments are identical to the melee weaponry. The Tonal Bow is unique in that it's a bow (duh) but it also uses your magicka to fire tonal arrows, which are effectively infinite if your magicka reserves can hold up. The arrows themselves are equivalent in damage to a daedric arrow and will colour code to the bow you equip.
  
Mechanically, this bow works by conjuring 50 tonal arrows whenever you equip it. Each arrow you fire costs 15 magicka. If your arrow count drops below 5 (possible in prolonged combat or with high magicka regen), then a replacement batch of arrows with be created automatically and you can continue to fire indefinitely. I've seen some mods and skills in the past which allow multiple arrows to be fired at once, so keeping the arrow count at 5+ seemed safe to accommodate all eventualities. Once your magicka drops below 15, then the next arrow you fire will force the bow to unequip.
  
Shoutout to [Unending Bow](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6844) by Fantafaust from where I cannibalised the scripting on the magic arrows.
  
  
  
  
**Optional File - MCO Weaponart energy beam addon**
  
In the optional files section you can find an addon for [MCO|ADXP](https://www.distaranimation.com) users which allows you to launch an energy beam when using any of these weapons and activating MCO's weaponart attack (dual power attack). This beam is pure energy (no additional effect like the blades have) that cannot be resisted and damage increases with each tier (25/40/60/80). The attacks cost 40 magicka .

Simply download and install with your mod manager. 
  
  
Each weapon type has a unique keyword, which users can use with DAR to apply unique movesets to the weapons (such as black's [MCO twinblades moveset](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71864) for twinblades or the [Wolong-Guandao](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78934)moveset for glaives.
  

  
* Sword  ﻿*("DwemerTonalWeaponry.esp" | 0x0806)*
Glaive ﻿ *("DwemerTonalWeaponry.esp" | 0x0868)*
  
* Daikatana*[i]("DwemerTonalWeaponry.esp" | 0x0894)*[/i]
Twinblade *[i]("DwemerTonalWeaponry.esp" | 0x096C)*[/i]
  

  
If using the optional MCO Weaponart addon, load it's ESP after the main mod.

I no longer include 2H options for the sword, or 1H options for the glaive and twinblade. For the most part this is to simplify, and also sword is unnecessary due to the daikatana/greatsword being added. Damage has been aligned based around the vanilla weapon types (ultimate tier damage is about the same as a moderately honed dragonbone weapons, and then plus the added enchantment damage, so they should scale well). Twinblades, despite now being classed as greatswords, do damage based on vanilla swords, as the hit multiple time's in the twinblade moveset.
  
  
I've tweaked the crafting recipe settings so that the weapon will appear in the Smithing menu as soon as you have the required skill levels and a weapon which can be upgraded to a new tier. It doesn't require you to have the correct soul gem before the recipe appears now, so you know what gem you need to go seeking.
  
  
If you're using [Precision](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72347), then you'll get colour-matched weapon trails with each weapon, as seen in some of the images.
  
  
﻿The Ultimate Tier weapon - I decided to make this use a generic enchantment so that you can choose whatever colour you want without compromising on character build. For example if you wanted to have a blue blade but you've not levelled in Destruction, the first few tiers you may have spent your time with a white or green etc blade instead. Now that you're a master, you can have the colour you feel like on the inside. 
  
Chaos damage can be OP, but it does give you something to think about if you've been using the red or purple blades before, as you'll be giving up some of their unique features.
  
Absorbing stamina I chose because it can be extremely powerful if using some of the modern gameplay overhauls that feature stamina for attacking and blocking. Robbing your enemy of stamina can prevent them attacking, and give you an infinite pool with which to attack or block.

Inspiration and ideas came from [Severance](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60212) and [Recolor Bound Weapons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74958), by *Sulhir*and *polinc*respectively.
  
The hilts are edited from the Dwemer wand and staffs in [Fulcimentum](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23825) by *takozawa*Script and method for the tonal bow and arrow was adapted from [Unending Bow](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6844) by *Fantafaust*[Quiverless Bound Bow](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26547) by *Scourgebane* helped me make the tonal bow... quiverless.
