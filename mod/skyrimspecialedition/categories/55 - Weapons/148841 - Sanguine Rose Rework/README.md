Enchantment Changes
  
Consume <2000> Enchantment charge to summon various Sanguine Dremora from Sanguine's realm, They will increase in power as you level up. You can choose their professions. They all have a variety of powerful skills, and they will exist permanently until they die in battle or are summoned again.

The price of tasting the power of the rose is that power is not given in vain. When you summon the Sanguine Dremora , it will reduce the recovery speed of health, mana, and stamina by <50%> until you no longer have the Sanguine Dremora summon.
