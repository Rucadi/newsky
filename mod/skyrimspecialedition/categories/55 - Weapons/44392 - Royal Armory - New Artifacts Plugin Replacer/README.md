A simple plugin replacer for [Royal Armory - New Artifacts](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6994), to smash typos and other issues, plus balancing the weapons, to make them worth stealing.
  
  
**[b][size=4]General Changes**[/size][/b]
  

  
* Loading screen position changes from "[Royal Armory Loading Screen Fixes and Addons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39898)﻿" are integrated into the plugin and rewrited the lore for better wording.
Quest redone from scratch, to assign weapons without script.
  
* Harbinger's Axe, Dagger of Shalidor and Jolhert are locked behind a display case. Respectively, you need Kodlak's Display Key (you will find it in the Kodlak's room, after his funeral), Arch-Mage's Quarters Key (you need to finish College's Questline) and Winter's Heart Display Key (you will find the key in the Elisif's room, in the wardrobe where is a Stone of Barenziah, when you become Thane of Haafingar), otherwise you can't pickup those weapons. About Pendulum and Smile, you will find them respectively in the destroyed Hall of Vigilants and on Cicero's corpse (or in his inventory if you spare him).
Changed and rebalanced weapon's enchantments to make them useful for non-enchanter characters, except Dagger of Shalidor (It's already powerful).
  
* Removed debug cell, lore book and unenchanted version of weapons.

**Installation**
  
Requires the original mod. Plugin flagged as ESL, so any existent patch will not work with this (They should be redone from scratch to use the plugin anyway). A new save is recommended, as in ongoing playthroughs display cases don't receive the correct changes and weapons may not spawn as intended. Otherwise, no support will be provided. Absolutely don't uninstall mid-playthrough, it will break your save.
