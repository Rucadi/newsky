﻿"...A long time ago, a very strong warrior forged for himself a blade so big that no one would dare to lift a finger against him, and those dumb enough to do it would usually find themselves split in half.
  
  
Due to the fact that people would be scared to death just by glimpsing the large chunk of metal, he quickly found himself bored because no one would challenge him in battle. This made the warrior go on a personal quest for glory and thrill, many foes he slayed, and much glory he earned...but that was not enough...
  
  
One day, he went on a hunt to find a group of horrible, vicious and unnatural sized dogs tainted by a curse, having slayed giants before, he thought this would be a easy task...but unfortunately, it was not the case, he ended up being thorn apart by the monsters, but his legend endured.
  
  
Some warriors along the years tried imitating the hero, but no many were capable of carrying a colossal sword around, but those who were, managed to make a name for themselves, one of them was even strong enough to forge and swing a blade that was bigger than the old stories, which he called...The Heavier Greatsword..."

When equipped, the greatsword grants you an ability called "Massive Stamp", which deals 2.2x times damage and area stagger your foes.
  
  
The weapon also swings a bit slower than warhammers, but has extended reach and increased stagger output.

Just a few months ago ,hunters and other folk that live around the area said that they saw a man with a giant sword go to marshes around Morthal and didn't return. Perhaps the blade still lost around the area...
