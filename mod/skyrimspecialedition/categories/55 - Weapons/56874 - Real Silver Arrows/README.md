# Real Silver Arrows

This mod adds silver arrows that work like other silver weapons\*. Specifically, when you shoot a werewolf, ghost, or undead with a silver arrow, the total damage is increased by 20, making silver arrows approximately as good as daedric arrows against those targets, but cheaper and easier to make.
  
  
Against anything else, silver arrows are no better than iron. Silver is a soft metal and not actually very good for making weapons.
  
  
The silver arrows look like steel arrows, because I'm no 3D artist. They require the steel smithing perk to craft, because that seems about right, or you can go raid the Silver Hand and take their ammo. It's no more than they deserve.
  
  
Compatible with Lore Friendly Ghosts, but doesn't require it. ESL-flagged ESP. Includes an SPID file to distribute silver arrows to the Silver Hand, Dawnguard, and Vigilants of Stendarr.
  
  
\* They really do work almost exactly the same way silver swords do. This would have been basically impossible or too heavy to use until SPID came along, but we're living in a new era now.
