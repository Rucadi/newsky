 *﻿"...Legends tell the story of a warrior of old, with a strenght so imense that was capable of single handedly fend entire armies, his raw physical strenght was only surpassed by his ire, an inflamated hate for a Aedra that wronged him, which turned into a unstoppable force of pure rage and destruction. This same warrior vowed, as long as he could walk, he would never cease his quest to destroy everything related to this very aedra.
  
  
 ﻿One day, the wave of destruction caused by this man caught the attention of Malacath, if he sworn himself to the Daedric Prince, he would help channel his ire even further. Malacath then bestowed him with a blade, forged in the hot forges from the Ashlands, the artifact would channel his rage into the weapon, concentrating its power, cutting through everything non stop with fiery wrath.
  
  
 ﻿Now with the artifact, the hateful warrior unleashed calamities to the worshippers of the Aedra, and following the destruction, an alliance arose in the hopes to stop him once and for all, a great battle was fought, in proportions that even changed the very shape of the land, but in the end, the army stood victorious, and the warrior, with its heart blistering in wrath and anger, burned way, and its ashes got assimilated to the blade, sealing its memories into the artifact, never to be removed.
  
  
 ﻿Unable to move the weapon due to its massive size and magical properties, the army buried it, and there it was left, to be completely forgotten. Centuries went by, and the blade that was once engulfed by the ground, now came to surface, be it by the shear will of memories that it holds, or cataclysmic events, it doesn't matter, but there it stands, waiting for someone worthy of its power..."*
