**This weapon pack adds 36 claymores
  
two-handed greatswords larger than the average size.**
  
  
[line]*"Before the great kingdom of High Rock was founded, early Breton warriors were known for wielding massive swords.
  
To overcome their smaller stature, they carried blades longer and larger than the standard weapon of the time.
  
Their ability to bridge this strength gap became legendary, and even in the 4th Era these blades remain famous under the name ‘Claymore.’"*
  
[line]
  
Inspired by the Highlander’s claymore from *For Honor*, this weapon pack introduces a new class of greatsword that sits in balance between vanilla greatswords and ultra greatswords — larger than the former but smaller than the latter.
  
  
  
**Weapon Stats:**
  

  
* Slightly slower than standard greatswords, but with higher damage.
18 standard claymores crafted from vanilla materials.
  
* 18 unique named claymores, upgraded from the standard versions at the Skyforge.
Unique claymores have no special enchantments, but boast higher base damage compared to their material tier.
  
* Their slightly slower speed is also brought back up to match vanilla greatswords, making them more efficient overall.

[line]**Animation Support:**
  
  
All claymores are tagged with a keyword for easy integration with custom animations.
  
This makes it simple to add claymore-specific animations through OAR optional mods or DAR condition sets.
