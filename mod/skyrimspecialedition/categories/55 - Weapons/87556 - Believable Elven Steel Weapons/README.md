I love [Elven Steel Armory](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78888)'s design, and I'm using [Believable Weapons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37737) as well, so I made this patch to make Elven Steel joining Believable Weapon's aesthetics.
  
  
Vanilla weapon types' proportion are similar to Elven in Believable Weapons.
  
Hammer's proportion is similar to [One-handed Warhammers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62271).
  
Hatchet﻿ and Shortsword are tweaked on my own taste.
  
Shield and Bow are simply decreased thickness like [Insane Armory](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2025).
  
Shortspear and Spear's grips are repositioned to match [Smooth Moveset](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70531).
