**The Legacy of Akaviri Blade : The Sealed Nodachi**
  
Forged in the distant lands of Akavir, this colossal nodachi was designed to slay the mighty dragons that once dominated the skies. When the dragons vanished from history, these weapons, too, fell into obscurity. Yet, with the dragons' return to Tamriel, whispers of ancient forging techniques have begun to resurface, spreading across the land of Skyrim.
  
  
Among these relics lies a legendary nodachi, crafted by a Blade who once hunted dragons with unparalleled skill. This mythical sword, however, is not easily found. Its true form is concealed within an ancient tome, bound by powerful magic. Only the Dragonborn possesses the strength and knowledge to break the seal and awaken the weapon’s true potential.
  
  
The enchanted tome, mistaken for a meaningless relic of the past, lies scattered and forgotten across Skyrim. Hidden in plain sight, it awaits the one destined to reclaim its secrets and wield a blade forged for the ultimate purpose: the slaying of dragons.

This mod introduces 53 meticulously crafted nodachi inspired by the elegant longswords of *Monster Hunter*. Each blade is designed to seamlessly integrate into the world of Skyrim, offering players a diverse and immersive weapon selection.
  
  

  
* **20 Craftable Blades:** These nodachi can be forged using vanilla materials, aligning with the existing crafting system. Their design and stats complement Skyrim's core gameplay, making them an accessible addition to your arsenal.

  
* **18 Unique Upgradable Nodachi:** Scattered across Skyrim are ancient tomes that hold the key to unlocking these rare nodachi. Slightly stronger than their craftable counterparts, these unique weapons feature special appearances and enchantments, elevating them to prized possessions for any adventurer.

  
* **15 Legendary Blades:** For those seeking power beyond the might of dragonbone weaponry, these legendary nodachi are the ultimate prize. However, crafting them requires finding even rarer tomes and gathering exotic materials. These tomes are hidden across Skyrim, challenging even the most determined Dragonborn to uncover their secrets.

  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  

  
* These nodachi are slightly slower than vanilla greatswords but offer increased range and higher base damage. They are also faster than ultra greatswords, striking a balance between speed and power.

  

  
* No smithing perks are required to craft unique or legendary nodachi. (Originally intended to use a custom system similar to Atronach Forge, but this was replaced with smithing for compatibility.)

  

  
* All weapons are tagged with the [WeapTypeNodachi] keyword, making it easier to assign custom animations.

  

  
* Most weapons use vanilla textures, meaning their appearance may vary depending on your mod setup. I primarily tested with vanilla textures and the *[Xavbio](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/xavbio/mods?gameId=1704) ﻿Equipment Texture* mod, which I highly recommend.

  

  
* For animations, the *Monster Hunter Animation Mod* is a perfect match and is also recommended for Nexus users.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
**Known Issues**
  

  
* Books cannot be read (does not affect gameplay as they meet weapon crafting conditions).

**Planned Updates (Possibly)**
  

  
* Adding unique scabbards for each blade.
Adjusting enchantment balance and visual effects.
  
* Adding detailed content to books.
Granting unique passive abilities (e.g., nodachi-related stat boosts) upon obtaining each book.
  
* While I initially planned to disable blocking and increase attack speed to mimic Monster Hunter mechanics, this feature was not implemented successfully. It may be added as an optional feature in the future.
