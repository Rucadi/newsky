These are model replacers for Akaviri Sword and Blades' Sword. Each variant can be a replacer for one or the other.
  
  
These models use a new texture mapping for the blade part with the intention of removing the seams, so it will be unaffected by custom texture replacers you have for the Blades' Sword.
  
  
Both Variants will have partial compatibility for custom retexture. Variant 1 will only affect the grip and guard part of the sword, while Variant 2 will only affect the guard part which uses your current steel sword textures, as it uses a modified texture for the grip part along with the custom blade part.
  
  
  
***Akaviri Sword replacers use an esp file to apply path changes to make the model unique. It requires USSEP as well for the adapted changes.***
  
  
**DSR patches included in all files.**
