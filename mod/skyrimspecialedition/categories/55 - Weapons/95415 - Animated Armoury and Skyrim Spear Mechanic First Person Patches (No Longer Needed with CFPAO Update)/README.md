# Animated Armoury and Skyrim Spear Mechanic First Person Patches (No Longer Needed with CFPAO Update)

I snooped around in the DAR folders to rename all the files so the first person animations from the respective mods override CFPAO. Without it you get your character swinging and holding spears like swords in first person.
  
  
Installation: install using preferred mod manager and allowing overwrites or extract to skyrim data folder
