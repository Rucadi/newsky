**About:**
  
Radiance is a unique ebony & steel mace that has a powerful gemstone that emits light.
  
  
The mace itself uses a vanilla light, so it is compatible with all versions of Skyrim SE+ and graphical enhancement mods. No longer do you need to carry a torch or cast light spells when using a one-handed or two-handed mace! Radiance will automatically light up when unsheathed and the light can also be toggled at the press of a button.
  
  
It is also possible to switch between One-Handed and Two-Handed versions at the press of a button (Light must be off), as well as toggle the light color and its radius.

**FAQ:**
  
**1) XB1 version? LE version?**• Nope, the required mods are not available on those!
  
  
**2) I can't switch to the 2H version!**• It only works when Radiance is sheathed and the light is toggled off.
  
  
**3) It doesn't work properly when I equip a Torch!**• That's the whole point, you don't need a torch! 
  
  
**4) Lights in my game flicker when I wield Radiance!**
  
• No more than they would with a regular Torch!
  
  
**5) How can I change the hotkeys?**• For now the keys are only editable via xEdit. I may add an MCM at a later date.
  
  
**6) Can my follower use Radiance?**• Yes! It will automatically light up when you unsheath your weapon for them too.
  
  
**7) This other things happens!**
  
• The implementation isn't completely free from bugs, however 99% of the time they will be fixed with either a re-equip or re-sheath.
