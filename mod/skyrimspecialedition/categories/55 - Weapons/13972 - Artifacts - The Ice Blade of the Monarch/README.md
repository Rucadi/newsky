**The Ice Blade Of The Monarch**
  
  
*"The Ice Blade of the Monarch is truly one of Tamriel's most prized artifacts. Legend has it that the Evil Archmage Almion Celmo enchanted the claymore of a great warrior with the soul of a Frost Monarch, a stronger form of the more common Frost Atronach. The warrior, Thurgnarr Assi, was to play a part in the assassination of a great king in a far off land, and become the new leader. The assassination failed and the Archmage was imprisoned. The Ice Blade freezes all who feel its blade. The Blade circulates from owner to owner, never settling in one place for long. —Yagrum Bagarn, Tamrielic Lore"*
  
  
On this adventure you will get your hands on the artifact **The Ice Blade of The Monarch**, a legendary frost enchanted sword that unlocks the power to summon a Frost Monarch. You will also find a stalhrim dagger by the name **Krahvalok** (Ice-Guardian) and a powerful ebony staff, **Apotheosis**. Everything is **obtained through a quest** that can be started by traveling to the camp in Pilgrim's Trench, from there you will have to face some powerful enemies and use a map to locate the Ice Blade.
  
  
The sword is offered in both two-handed and one-handed versions, all items are **balanced** to fit in the game as late-game equipment and can be **tempered** (daedric smithing for the Ice Blade, Ebony smithing for Krahvalok). **Crafting of unenchanted replicas** of the weapons is available while having the required perk and the original item in inventory. The quest has been **playtested extensively** by me, but if you encounter any bug do tell and I'll fix it. In the artistic department, all models and textures were carefully crafted from scratch, any feedback you can provide is appreciated.
