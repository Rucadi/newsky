All plugins are flagged as ESL.
  
  
Can be easily done in SSEEdit, but not everyone is tech-savvy enough, so I'm sharing it. Now these new weapons will properly use katana animations instead of sword animations.
  
  
All dagger katanas have not been affected. I think they should use different moveset so I don't want to throw them into one bag with "regular" katanas. Two handed katanas also have not been changed, Animated Armoury does not support two handed katanas.
  
Some patches might contain different weapons like spears or staves.
