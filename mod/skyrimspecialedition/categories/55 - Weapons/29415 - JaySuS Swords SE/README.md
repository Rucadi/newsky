﻿Note from the uploader:
  
Since there wasn't an official port and almost everyone in the old page had some trouble
  
converting it for personal use,
  
I decided to contact JaySuS for an official port. Easier said than done.
  
He was innactive from Nexus, his inbox full and nobody appart from himself could give the permission.
  
So, after some search, I tracked him down to this [website](https://www.artstation.com/orphitecktion)﻿, (check it out he has been doing some awesome stuff with 3D art)
  
and after we made contact there, the rest took place on facebook. 
  
I uploaded screenshots of the parts of the conversation were he is giving me explicit permission for this.
  
  
In the future I will be making small updates  and provide support for it.
  
  
Enjoy the mod!
  
p.s. The player home used in the screenshots is [Aemer's Refuge](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4751)﻿ by [LeanWolf](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/42978)﻿, check it out it's phaenomenal!

From the [Original mod page﻿](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1002/)﻿:
  
All weapons in this mod were created using a professional pipeline
  
from very high detail models with around 7million polygons each. 
  
Every little notch and cranny you see is an actual 3 dimensional feature on the original model
  
and was put there by hand with lots of care and love.
  
No textures were used, every single dot was painted by hand to simulate the material in question
  
to the best of my current abilities.
  
  
This mod contains the following weapons,
  
most require the steel smithing perk but some may require more advanced smithing perks:

Install with your favorite mod manager
  
It shouldn't conflict with other mods except those that edit the weapon leveled lists.
  
It's a minor conflict wich means that either NPCs will carry weapons from this mod or the other (wichever is loaded last)
  
I will try to provide patches for the major weapon mods as best I can.
  
A patch for [Immersive Weapons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16788)﻿ exists already in the optional files.
  
  
 The Craft Only version is for those who only want to craft everything at a forge, with the appropriate perks.
