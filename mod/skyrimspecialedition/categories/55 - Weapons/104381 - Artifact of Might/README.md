﻿﻿With **Artifact of Might** you'll get access to 8 new unique weapons for you to use in your adventures. All of them are hand placed in certain location and point of interests within the game's world which, in my opinion, felt appropriate; the inspiration and design for this weapons comes from different sources, most notably: Assassin Creed - Vallhalla, Games of Thrones, and various norse-themed weapons design found while browsing the net. All the meshes and textures are custom made from scratch to the best of my actual abilities.
  
  

**The mod contains the following weapons:**

The mod itself should be safe to uninstall whenever you like it, however it is always recommended to do so in a safe manner, i.e.: unequip and remove from favorites any weapons you are currently using, same goes for every follower, travel to the nearest interior space ( player's house are a great example ) and save your game. Proceed with the unistallation process and simply reload your game from where you left it.

Since all the weapons are hand placed in specific location it will surely conflict with other mods which modify or edit the same location, try to push the Artifact of Might.esp further down your load order
