*[left]“The Scourge of Whiterun" is a famous horror story told throughout the Whiterun hold. It is a tale passed on by generations and while
  
much of it may be embellished, it still has remained one of the most renowned folklore tales of the region. One that has exhilarated and
  
 horrified people for many, many years.

Just north of Whiterun, you will find the **[Silent Moons Camp](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Silent_Moons_Camp)**. At first, it seems just like any other bandit-filled dungeon, until you encounter the named Lunar Forge on top of the hill and the enchanted weapons, called Lunar weapons. There really isn’t anything more to it than that. The Lunar weapons are just common iron and steel weapons with a unique enchantment, and the named forge doesn’t actually provide any benefits. It’s almost like a piece of lore was cut from this area.
  
  
I started designing a bunch of visually new Lunar weapons as part of a new [Heavy Armory](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6308?tab=description) update. But I realised quickly that I couldn't just give the weapons a new character without also creating the rest of the story.
  
Next, I started writing some new lore, continued on from that by editing the Silent Moons Camp location, and next thing I knew, this small update had become its own full mod.
  
  
Lunar Armory adds new models for the Lunar Weapons, changes their enchantment, changes the Lunar Forge and the entire Silent Moons location, adds lore to the area and extends the dungeon with a new (hidden) section.

**New weapons**
  
[The vanilla Lunar weapons](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Lunar_Weapons) were identical to standard iron and steel.
  
I redid the design for Lunar Amory to make the weapons now look ancient and more vicious, like they were forged by an ancient evil long ago.
  
  
In vanilla, you could find a war axe, sword and mace in both enchanted iron and steel. I ditched the iron versions altogether and extended the range to also include a dagger, greatsword, warhammer and battle axe. You can find these in normal **Lunar steel** or **Honed Lunar steel**!
  
Lunar steel weapons will be around the Orcish tier. Honed Lunar steel is closer to Elven.
  
  
My mod is designed to be used alongside **Heavy Armory** and/or **Animated Armoury**, but it doesn't require them. You can use this mod **stand-alone** or alongside any weapon pack of your choice.
  
  
Note that this mod **does not add new animations**, and new weapon types will make use of **whatever animation mod you have installed** (as long as they are **compatible with [OCF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81469)**).
  
  
  
**New Enchantment**
  
You can find the new Lunar weapons in both enchanted and unenchanted versions, and the higher your level, the stronger the enchantments you encounter.
  
The Lunar enchantment was changed from the vanilla version. The book "Notes on the Lunar Forge" in the vanilla game described the Lunar weapons as having a Drain Health ability that is only active when the moons are out (between 9 pm and 5 am). This seems to have been Bethesda's original intent, but for some reason, the actual weapon enchantment was changed to do fire damage! This mod changes the enchantment to drain health, and adds a little extra perk:
  
Lunar weapons do 25% more damage to Werewolves and Werebears.
  
  
  
**Overhaul of the Silent Moons camp**
  
The exterior has been changed to be a lot more interesting and imposing. This was once a true stronghold that has long fallen into ruins.
  
I’ve made some practical changes as well as adjustments for visual storytelling. The interior cell had its name changed to Silent Moons Ruins. Otherwise, the interior location hasn't had a lot of changes, but I did add an entrance to the Inner Sanctum. What is in there? Well, the door is locked, so you'd better look for that key if you want to find out…
  
Just like in vanilla, you'll have a chance to find some Lunar steel weapons lying around here.
  
  
Oh yeah, the Lunar Forge can now actually be used to create (unenchanted) Lunar weapons! Both the normal and the Honed version.
  
Important side note: The Lunar Forge is the only place you can create these Lunar steel weapons, and even then, only at night!
  
  
  
**Changes to the bandits** 
  
The bandits in the Silent Moons Camp now have a chance of carrying a Lunar steel weapon. They've settled into a ruin that has some powerful weapons lying around. Makes sense, some of them decided to claim one for themselves! Since the location was extended, I also added a couple of extra bandits to populate it.
  
  
  
**New Lore**
  
This was a big one for me, but it is completely optional for the player.
  
You'll find a couple of books in the ruins that might clue you in to what happened in this place and who actually created the Lunar Forge. You can find a couple of journals lying around (including an updated version of the vanilla book "Notes on the Lunar Forge"), and you might even encounter 2 new books called "The Scourge of Whiterun". This story comes in 2 volumes that you might find in the ruins, but I also added them to book level lists, so you might encounter these in shops or the College library!
  
Again, reading all this is completely optional, but it will give you more context to the weapons, as well as the "boss" enemies you'll find in the ruins.

**A general note on compatibility and the "weapons-only" version**
  
  
There are a couple of mods out there that overhaul the Lunar weapons, so obviously, those will be incompatible with Lunar Armory.
  
  
Lunar Armory should be compatible with most other mods, besides those that overhaul the Silent Moons Camp location.
  
In those cells, I added meshes and NPCs, and adjusted the Navmesh. No landscape changes were made.
  
  
These are the cells that are changed in Lunar Armory:
  
> - 00009146 (SilentMoonsCampBlacksmith02)
>   
> - 00009165
>   
> - 0000951F (SilentMoonsCampBlacksmith)
>   
> - 00009540 (SilentMoonsCampExterior)
>   
> - 00009541
>   
>   
> Also, the interior cell:
>   
> - 00015211 (SilentMoonsCamp01)

  
If you have any mod that also changes these cells, then make sure to load Lunar Armory after them.
  
  
  
**If you are worried about compatibility issues with other mods that change the same cells, then you can choose to get a "weapons-only" version of the mod. This version still adds the weapons and makes them craftable at the Lunar Forge. It's included in the FOMOD installer. In the first step of the installation process, you get to choose which version you want.**
  
  
  
--This mod does not include LOD meshes, so I advise you to run [DynDOLOD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/111991) after installing.--
  
  
  
**Patches**
  
Here is a list of patches for other mods. Unless stated otherwise, you'll find these in the FOMOD installer:

* [Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802)

Merges the changes to the "Notes on the Lunar Forge" book to fix direct incompatibility issues
  
While it doesn't add displays for the new weapons, it does make LotD's Lunar Weapons craftable for display purposes.
  
Having one of Lunar Armory's Lunar Steel Maces, Swords, or War Axes in your inventory, including Honed versions, will allow crafting of the corresponding weapon type at the Lunar Forge during the night.
  
Includes integrated CCOR support (but CCOR isn't required).**OUDATED
  
  
There is a patch for** [Serenity](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30019)﻿ available[here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70796)  **- It is incompatible with any version past 2.0! Don't use it!**
  
  
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/YowUk8C.png)**﻿- Will you make a patch for mod X? / Can I make a patch for mod X?**In general, I am likely to make a patch if it is a mod I use myself, or that's otherwise easy to throw together. But of course, if you want to take things into your own hands and create a patch for any conflicting mod you find, then you are free to do so.
  
  
**- How can I craft Lunar weapons?**You can only craft Lunar steel at the Lunar forge, and only between 9 pm and 5 am.
  
You'll need the steel perk for the normal weapons and the advanced smithing perk for the Honed versions.
  
  
 **- Why doesn't the Lunar enchantment work?**The effect from the Lunar enchantment only works when the moons are out, i.e. between 9 pm and 5 am.
  
  
**- Can I put the Lunar enchantment on other weapons?**You can simply destroy a Lunar weapon to learn the effect and use Enchanting to put it on any weapon of your choosing.
  
  
**- The door to the Inner Sanctum is locked!**You'll have to find a key, but it's well hidden. Look around the exterior. Explore. It's hiding (somewhat) in plain sight in a "container" (so no worries about accidentally fus-ro-dah ing the thing).
  
  
In case you are really stuck finding that key: [It's right here](https://i.imgur.com/CCyUDvR.jpg)
