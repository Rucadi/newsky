Another small player home, this tower-house serves as keep and fortress for a Thane of Dawnstar!
  
Cozy, warm in the frozen north, made for lower-class lords but well-kept.
  
Nothing too fancy. The key is on the barrels by the door, but who would have left it there?
  
It might not have the tallest tower or thickest walls, but for the Dragonborn?
  
It's home.
  
  
This mod provides:
  
- Finely decorated single-cell interior, made to feel as vanilla as possible
  
- Unique exterior and interior design
  
- Resource-Lite! No major FPS drops hopefully
  
- Mid-Game-Friendly, requiring only the base DLC's
  
- 1 master bed, 1 follower bed, basic Smithing stations included.
  
- Works wonderfully with Cutting Room Floor
  
- 9 weapon racks, 3 plaques, 1 mannequin. A modest amount of storage
  
-Navmeshed and Cleaned with Tes5Edit
  
-Located on the hill east of Nightgate Inn
  
  
[size=4]No alchemy or enchanting, you'll have to visit town for those.
  
No gardening. It is a very cold place.
  
Not adoption friendly; made with MHIYH in mind.
  
This uses mostly Whiterun textures, in case you want your own texture replacer.
  
  
I may expand this castle, or add new levels, if enough people would like that.
