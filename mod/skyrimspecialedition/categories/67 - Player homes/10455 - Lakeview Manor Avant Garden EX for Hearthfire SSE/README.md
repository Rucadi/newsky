**Backstory:**
  
  
The original mod was an expansion of the existing Lakeview Pool and Hot Baths mod, by adding a garden and a perimeter wall. Since it was very lush it was appropriate to call it Avant Garden.
  
  
Today the mod has been streamlined and some huge improvements added to ensure your character and your family's comfort and safety.
