This mod replaces the many required building materials of expanding the noble house at Felburg with a cost of gold ≈ the base value of the materials that were  previously needed. 
  
  
Let's take for example the Camp Expansion upgrade. It previously required: 25 Firewood, 25 Leather Strips, 25 Leather, and 20 Iron Fittings. The base value of the materials is roughly 530 gold.
  
  
So instead of having to hunt down merchants with these materials. This mod instead directly replaces the material cost for gold.
