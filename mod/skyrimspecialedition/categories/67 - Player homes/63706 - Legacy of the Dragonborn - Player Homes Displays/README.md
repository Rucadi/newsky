Compatibility:
  

  
* Optional Files include display patches for Breezehome by Elianora, The Ravens Breezehome, Breezehome TNF, and Wind District Breezehome - Reborn
The Curators Companion (TCC) Patch is built in LotD v6.x.  LotD v5.x still needs the optional TCC patch.
  
* Compatible with Alternate Start - Live Another Life (player home start options)
Any texture replacers should work fine
  
* Dedicated spot in LotD East Exhibit Halls...shouldn't conflict with anything
Collision was removed on all models, so won't affect performance
  
* ESL flagged light plugin
