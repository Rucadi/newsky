*[font=Georgia]Crystalwind Estate located at Rielle Falls, has been in the Dragonborns family for many many generations, although it has been unoccupied for a very long time, the Caretakers have watched over the property since the first ancestors built the estate, who himself was a student of the Greybeards and also the College of Winterhold. The legends tell while studying with the Greybeards he had a vision of your coming and was then instructed by Akatosh to prepare a place for the future Dragonborn. The Caretakers were hired as helpers and their love for all the generations of families that have live and thrived here have bound their souls to Rielle Falls as the eternal guardians. Crystalwind is a beautiful, magical place, blessed by the divines to be worthy of the Dragonborn. Make haste, the Caretakers patiently await your arrival to take your rightful place as the next heir to Crystalwind Estate.[/font]*
