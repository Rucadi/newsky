This is an addon to the awesome mod [Crystalwind Estate and the Waterfalls of Rielle](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62955)﻿ by [WastelandWarlord99](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/103271073)

  
* I love Crystalwind Estate, but with its remote location, far removed from carriage and ferry routes, I had just 1 complaint. After a long day of adventuring, you are tired, loaded with loot, and usually a long way from home. Sometimes you just want to be back home enjoying a beverage by the fire instead of trudging through the mountains fending off frost trolls and ice wraiths.
This mod adds a Teleport spell which will deposit you in front of the main residence building from wherever you are. So now you can be home with your loved ones, beverage in hand in a matter of minutes.
  
* To learn the spell, just look for the spell book on the night stand next to the bed in the main residence
The spell is a novice level alteration spell
  
* If you choose the Two Way Teleport option in the FOMOD, you will also be able to return to the spot you teleported home from. This works by setting a marker at the location you teleported from. If you cast the teleport spell anywhere in the Crystalwind Estate worldspace, it will return you to that marker.
If you choose the One Way Teleport option, the spell will always teleport you to Crystalwind Estate with no return option
  
* The plugin is an ESP-FE so it won't count against your plugin limit and has been cleaned in XEdit
This mod now works with all versions of Crystalwind Estate including the ESM versions under Optional Files. The FOMOD should detect which version of Crystalwind Estate is installed and automatically select and install the proper version of this mod.
  

  

Installation

  

  
* Make sure Crystalwind Estate and the Waterfalls of Rielle is installed and activated
Install this mod using your preferred mod manager
  
* Make sure that Crystalwind Estate Teleport.esp loads after Crystalwind\_Estate.esp (or .esm)

  

Updating

  
I updated the original script so it should now be safe to update and to switch back and forth between 1 way and 2 way teleport. Just rerun the installer overwriting (Replacing) when prompted. 
  
  
If you change your Crystalwind Estate version from Standard (Main Files) to ESM (Optional Files) or vice versa, then you will need to reinstall this mod to update the esp. That will require a new game or at the very least, going back to a save before any version of Crystalwind Estate was installed.
  
  

Compatibility

  

  
* Because this mod only makes a couple minor changes within the Crystalwind Estate worldspace, it shouldn't conflict with anything else

  

Permissions

  
I don't know much about permissions and there's not much of interest in this mod. The script is pretty basic, but I have included the source code for it. You are free to use (or critique) it however you wish. Otherwise, I would just say to follow the Crystalwind Estate permissions.

Thanks to Jonathan over at the XEdit discord for taking the time to answer my scripting questions and whose suggestions pointed me in the right direction with the 2 way teleport script
