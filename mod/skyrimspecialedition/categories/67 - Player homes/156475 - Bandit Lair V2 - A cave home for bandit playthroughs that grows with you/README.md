**Bandit Lair** is a medium-sized cave hideout designed for the aspiring bandit king or queen who wants comfort, function, and a touch of menace. The home sleeps 8 and comes fully equipped for life outside the law.
  
  
Inside, you’ll find **all crafting stations** except the staff enchanter and spider crafting, plus a **General Stores** network for centralised storage across the lair. Your loot is safe in ample named containers, and your gear can be displayed on 7 mannequins.
  
  
The **interactive treasury** lets you invest gold to upgrade the home, gradually filling it with piles of wealth to match your growing infamy. A **Change Appearance mirror** lets you alter your look at will, and a dedicated **Nirnroot nursery** contains 30 crimson nirnroots for *you-know-which* quest. For Kaidan players, the lair includes the book *Dragon Language – Myth No More*.
  
  
Smelting recipes for silverware and Dwemer items are included, and the cave is already marked on your map. You’ll find it in the Reach, just south of **Arkngthamz** and right next to the Reach Burial Mound.
  
  
**Most upgrades are permanent** — trophies, displays, and wealth remain once earned. Certain opulent decorations (unlocked at 50,000 gold) will only remain while the gold stays invested.
  
  
I have included the vanilla version (V1, no interactive treasury), and a version that does not need General Stores. You can find them on the Download page. Only install one version.
  
  
  
**How does it work?**
  
  
In the back of the cave, behind the shiny door, is a small chest called "Illgotten Gains". This is where you put your money in. At various stages things will start to appear in the cave. Pay attention to notifications in the top left of your screen. 
  
Some items will vanish if you take the money back out, but they will reappear upon hitting that threshold again. 
  
The trap door, key, and Bonehilda are permanent, no need to worry about those. Bonehilda, once unlocked, wil enable you to toggle the major set of visual upgrades, no matter how much money is in your Gains chest. 
  
Note: you cannot take out a certain amount from the chest. It's all or nothing, I'm afraid. Hence I recommend putting some moneys into the other safe chests, so you can juggle a bit better. 
  
  
  
Issues/Mod Conflicts:
  
So far, I have only come across one:
  
  
Use Those Blankets: There will be more than one blanket on your sleepy bandit. Impact: not very big
  
  
"Conflicts" shown regarding custom meshes and textures usually just mean I've used the same asset in another mod, or someone else used it in theirs. They aren't really conflicts, but you can possibly have different visuals depending on which mod you load first. Not a biggie, can be safely ignored.
  
  
Lighting: The cave is supposed to be dark. I made it dark. Everything else depends on your ENB/Reshaders and Weather systems.
