**REQUIRES ALL DLCS**

  
  
Harborside is a somewhat nautical themed, no load doors player home built into the bridge over the Solitude docks. It features typical home amenities, is follower-friendly, and compatible with most mods that edit the Solitude docks area.
  
  
All windows and doors can be opened and closed freely; let the sea breeze in or lock up to weather a storm.
  
  
Watch the waves go by while waiting for your ship to arrive, scout your next mark for plundering, or manage Imperial trade in style - Harborside is a unique home for many types of characters.
  
  
The house is freely available by default, buyable version available courtesy of [elr0y7](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5114692)!
