**Description**
  
  
As I always ended up with way too much gold at higher level, I wanted to add some more goldsinks. For this reason, I added a cost of 10k septims to purchase Severin Manor. Originally, this was just a personal edit, but people convinced me to release it as an actual mod.
  
  
After you completed the [Served Cold](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Served_Cold) quest, a notice will show up at the entrance of Severin Manor. If you read it, you can talk to Adril Arano's wife, [Cindiri Arano](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Cindiri_Arano), to buy the manor for 10,000 septims. If you do, she'll hand you the deed and a key to the house.
  
  
You can change the price to whatever you would like, using the console command:
  
  

```
set ANDR_SeverinManorPrice to X
```

Whereas X is the price. Keep in mind that the amount displayed in dialogue may not update, but the actual price will.
  
  
  
**FAQ**
  
  
Q: Why would you do this?
  
A: As I always ended up with way too much gold at higher level, I wanted to add some more goldsinks. For this reason, I added a cost of 10k septims
  
 to purchase Severin Manor. Originally, this was just a personal edit, but people convinced me to release it as an actual mod. If you don't like that, that's okay. Just ignore this mod and move along silently.
  
  
Q: Is this compatible on a existing save?
  
A: As long as you haven't started the Served Cold quest, yes. If you did the quest already, this mod will not retroactively work.
  
  
Q: Why do I need to talk to Cindiri, instead of Adril?
  
A: Unfortunately, both Adril and Morvayn use a voice type that has very limited amount of lines and as such, I didn't find any suitable ones for selling/buying a home. Cindiri made the most sense, as well as using a voice type that has some suitable lines.
  
  
Q: Will you do the same for the houses added by the CC content (Hendraheim, etc)?
  
A: Yes, check my profile page. I've done several one of them.
  
  
Q: ESPFE?
  
A: Yes.
  
  
Q: Is this compatible with <insert mod>?
  
A: I don't know by heart. You might need to check yourself.
  
  
Q: Will you make a patch for <insert mod>?
  
A: Only if it's a mod I use myself or plan on using, I have enough time and I actually like the idea. Otherwise, feel free to do it yourself. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: I have a suggestion to improve the mod. Can you do it?
  
A: Maybe, if I have time and I like the idea, I'll consider it.
  
  
Q: Will you port this to <insert platform>?
  
A: No, I myself only support the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If someone else wants to port it, feel free. (see permission) If you decide to port it, you yourself take full responsibility to offer support to said port. I will not provide no support for any ports by third parties.
  
  
Q: I use a ported version of this mod on <insert platform> and I have a problem. Can you help?
  
A: I don't provide any support for third party ports on other platforms than the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If you have issues, you should adress the person that ported it.
  
  
Q: Does this work on Skyrim 1.6+, aka "Anniversary Edition"?
  
A: Yes, it should.
  
  
Q: Why don't your mods use MCMs and instead use this janky console command system to set globals?
  
A: I am not a fan of MCMs. You can set the globals by making a patch in xEdit. I have no plans of changing this. If you want to add an MCM, feel free. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: Why don't you use FOMODs?
  
A: That would require reuploading the entire mod, in question, even if I only make a small change. My internet is limited and reuploading the files each time will take a huge chunk of my monthly volume.
