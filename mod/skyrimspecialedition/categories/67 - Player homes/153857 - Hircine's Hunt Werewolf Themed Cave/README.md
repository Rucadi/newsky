# Hircine's Hunt Werewolf Themed Cave
- Author: michaeldovah
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/153857


It is a small, simple cave, intended as a quick refuge between adventures. It has a few workstations (tanning rack, workbench, grindstone and cooking spit), secure internal storage (no respawns), a table and benches, a single bed and a small bedroll for a follower. It also has an altar dedicated to the hunting prince, *Hircine*.
  
  
**Note:** I use the amazing mod "*[Wintersun - Faiths of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506)*" to make the game's religion more immersive.
  
  
***About Hircine***
  
  
*Hircine is the Daedric Prince known as the spirit of the hunt, the sportsman of the Daedra; the great gambler, the pursuer, and the sacrifice of mortals. He is also known as "The Hunter of Princes" and the "Father of the Beastmen". His summoning date is the 5th of Midyear. Hircine is the creator of Lycanthropy. He is often seen as the most honorable hunter to walk any plane of existence, and as such he is often well-regarded by some hunters and fishermen.*
  
  
***Location***
  
  
Located just a few steps from the **Falkreath** gate, turning right after teleporting into the city and walking to the gate exit. ~~There is no marker on the map, just teleport or travel to Falkreath and everything will be fine~~. **Updated version 1.0.1:** map marker added :)
  
  
***Compatibility***
  
  

  
1. **PATCH** available for the amazing mod: [Cities of the North - Falkreath](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56731?tab=description).The optional version is an edit to my mod's own file, so it only **requires** the **COTN** mod. Download it **INSTEAD** of the main file. Thank you for your amazing work on this mod, *JPSteel2*.
**PATCH** available for the another amazing mod: *[Wintersun - Faiths of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506).*
  
2. Double **PATCH**available for the amazing mods: *[Wintersun - Faiths of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506) (don't use this patch with patch 2) and**[Daedric Shrines - All in One](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78772)﻿. **Note:** This patch is not compatible with the patch between these two mods, as it changes the shape of the statues and altars.*

Please let me know if anything isn't working and I'll try to fix it (this is one of the first house mods I'm making for the game, so, sorry if something doesn't work as expected). This is a really simple cave home, nothing major, just letting you know :)
