* **INTRODUCTION**

I've always had a soft spot for the vanilla player homes, especially the ones in the major cities. There's something about them: the unique designs, the quests you need to do to get them (even tho *not* all of them are interesting, I must admit), the lives that your spouses and children can live in a walled city, your faithful and unwanted family addition - I mean, your housecarl... As I always do in my *never ending* modding journey, I strive to stay as close to the vanilla feeling as possible with the mods that I use, but unfortunately I never found a proper overhaul that really keeps things simple and lore-friendly. Don't get me wrong, there are some *awesome* options out there, and I got inspired by them, but unfotunately they didn't seem right for what I had in mind: one added a bath or extra beds, another used new assets or altered the original layout... *Not bad options*, just not was I was looking for, you know what I mean? So... I willingly decided to fall into the rabbit hole that is the Creation Kit, and I started to learn how to do things *my way*. This series aims to transform all vanilla player homes into something more, but still *vanilla*. Hopefully it will turn out great: I'm open to suggestions and technical advices, since that I'm still an *amateur* modder.
  
  
  

  
* **WHAT THIS MOD CHANGED AND ADDED**

While Honeyside is small and not very fancy even for a rich hold like the Rift, it has a lot of personality thanks to its vicinity to water, plus it's well decorated even in vanilla Skyrim. I tried to reflect that while staying as light as possible with the changes:
  
  
- Minor additions to the main hall and player bedroom (which are the same thing in this case lol).
  
- Hearthfire oven and butter churn added.
  
- One weapon rack added on the first floor.
  
- More refined and dignified housecarl room, within the limits that a basement has.
  
- Enchanting table added, so it's recommended that you buy the child room upgrade (sorry for the mannequins, couldn't find a place to add more).
  
- Some minor external changes and decorations on both sides, nothing too fancy.
  
  
NOTE: *only two light bulbs added, no vanilla lighting changes, no navmeshes edited, all new objects that may get in the way are navcut (hopefully), file cleaned and flagged as ESL*, so it won't take a plugin spot. Let me know if something is wrong and I'll try to fix that!
  
  
ANOTHER NOTE: if you want to make a patch for this mod, feel free to share it, but I'm too lazy to make them.
  
  
  

  
* **REQUIREMENTS AND NOTES**

None, but there is a *BIG NOTE*: the changes were done in the CK *without* taking in consideration the buy-upgrades-from-steward system, since it was too much of a pain to even consider to deal with scripts. That means that if you haven't fully upgraded the house before entering it, you might find floating furniture. So it is *strongly* - and I mean it, *strongly* - recommended that you buy all upgrades - including child bedroom - before ever setting foot on your house for the first time. Adding this mod in an already existing save with all upgrades should be safe, but I woudn't recommend it either. Oh, and the mod was built while keeping in consideration USSEP, but doesn't require it and *shouldn't*need a patch; same thing for Hearthfire Extended, since I didn't touch the orchard.
  
  
  

  
* **RECOMMENDATIONS**

If you're looking for something more while still keeping things fairly simple, try the wonderful [Vanilla Player Homes Revamped](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/118675), which heavily inspired this series; if you want even more, the immortal [TNF Skyrim House Remodel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39333) is your choice.
