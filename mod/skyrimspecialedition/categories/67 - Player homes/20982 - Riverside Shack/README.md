**Description**
  
  
  
Riverside Shack is an old abandoned dwelling just southwest of Windhelm, east of Gallows Rock and along the White River. In the vanilla game, it serves very little purpose other than to house a levelled animal, usually a sabre tooth cat. This mod aims to make much more use of the abandoned shack by allowing the player to rebuild the broken-down structure and turn it into a cosy home for the player to come back to after his/her adventures.
  
  
The mod comes with a short quest providing some backstory to the previous owner and provides a small reward depending on which path you choose to take. Building the home is a simple process and works similarly to the Hearthfire system with tutorials provided as you progress through sections of the mod. You'll have the opportunity to customise your home, changing the colours of the bed covers, drapery and even roofing on the shack.
  
  
Make yourself at home, customise the shack to your style and relax by the river away from dragons, your spouse and adopted children.[font=corbel]

**The Story**
  
  
  
[/font]Riverside Shack comes with a short story to help bring backstory to the shack and to blend it more into the land of Skyrim. It's a short quest and extremely quick to complete, especially if you take the easier route. The consequences of your actions however can have a lasting effect on the mod after the quest has been completed. You can read the spoiler below for brief details on the quest if you're experiencing those consequences.
  
​
  
SpoilerThe remains in the shack are those of a man named Irnste who has been eaten by an unusual black sabre cat. You will discover a letter that was intended to be delivered to his old friend up in Solitude. Delivering the letter results in a small reward and you'll meet a man named Roglin. He'll bury his old friend in a small grave near the shack and visit once per week for 4 hours. Burning the note, however, results in the shack becoming haunted and you'll experience haunted events before being prompted to dig up Irnste's remains and burn his bones to lay him to rest. These are found at the location where the grave would have been placed to the left of the shack on a small hill.[font=corbel]
  
  
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
  
  
[/font]The main compatibility issues with this mod will be with anything that edits the same cells, mainly **riversideshackexterior01**. One popular mod known to have an issue is Interesting NPCs, however, a patch has been included in the FOMOD to relocate the NPC in question.
  
  
Other minor compatibility issues will include mods that add animations to beds such as [Go To Bed](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4224)﻿. A patch is included for GTB within the FOMOD. Additionally, any mod that adds a light source for the campfire in the abandoned shack will need the light to be enabled parented to the **RSXStructrue** reference, otherwise, there will be light bleeding through the walls from an old light source. Also included in the FOMID are patches for [Relighting Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8586)﻿ and [Tamriel Master Lights](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36726)﻿.
  
  
One final small patch is also the inclusion of two meshes for [SD's Horn Candles](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40192)﻿.
