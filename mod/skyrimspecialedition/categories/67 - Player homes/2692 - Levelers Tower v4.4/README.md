**Levelers Tower**   
Cheat mod for Skyrim Special Edition
  
Version 4.4 - 11/27/2016 - Release
  
by WillieSea

  
   
-INSTALLATION--------   
1. Unpack the file you downloaded using a 7z uncompression program and copy the file to your Skyrim Special Edition (SSE) installation folder:
  
\Steam\SteamApps\common\Skyrim Special Edition\Data\
  
2. On the game menu, choose 'Mods' and 'Load Order' and activate the mod.
  
   
-REFRESH Mod---------   
Why is a refresh necessary sometimes?
  
 When a mod is being developed, and sometimes things get modified and they will not show up in your save game.
  
Why don't they show up in my save game?
  
Because, the save game is loaded into memory last. Think of your save game as the last item in your load order. So, if something is saved in your saved game, such as a container location, the position of that container will be taken from your save game, not the mod. So you need to remove all mod information from your save game, or refresh it.
  
How do I refresh the mod in my save game?
  
1.. First, make sure you clear out all the containers, displays, everything from the mod interiors. With a refresh, everything will be reset to new.
  
2. Disable the mod in your load order and then load up your save game. Once loaded, save it as a new save game.
  
3. Restart the game and enable the mod in your load order. Then load your cleaned save game.
  
Do I always have to refresh the mod with every new version?
  
No. It is only necessary to refresh the mod when I move stuff around and I will always let you know that I recommend a mod refresh. Most updates you can simply install the update and continue playing.
  
   
-LOCATION------------   
The tower is located North of Helgen, just to the right as you exit the Helgen starter dungeon. There will be a map marker pointing to it. Check the uploaded pictures for an image of the map and its location.
  
   
-DESCRIPTION---------   
Player Home Base with so many features it will make your head spin. You can quickly create test characters for testing your own mods, re-create a lost character due to hardware failure or save game corruption, or just have fun making any type of character you like.
  
This readme document should have all the information you need to play the mod to its full advantage. Please read it before asking questions.
  
   
-FEATURES------------   
\*TOWER TOP\*--------------   
\*Welcome Book for you to read.
  
\*Auto-sorter ALL your un-modified vanilla equipment that does 'all' items at once. It will not cleanse your equipment first, only move it. This includes your ingredients. If you crouch when you use it, it will also move all magical equipment.
  
\*Individual Auto-sorters on each chest for all your un-modified vanilla equipment. If there is a magical version of the base equipment, if you are crouched (sneaking) when you activate the auto-sorter it will also auto-sort all of the magical version of that type of equipment. NOTE: This can be very slow so don't go crazy clicking buttons. These Auto-sorters will 'clean' the ownership from the items it sorts. Unfortunately, this also cleans it of any enchantments you placed on the item.
  
\*DLC auto-sorters are added as they become available (You install them). They are NOT part of the 'All' button explained above.
  
\*Arrow auto-sorter features the ability to 'exclude' a certain type of vanilla arrow from the auto-sorting script when you crouch and activate.
  
\*Broom that will clean up the cobwebs. If they return, use the broom again. If you don't see the broom, its a game engine bug, and I suggest you exit the game and reload your save game from before you entered the tower the first time.
  
\*Explosive arrows - In arrow container. Fire, Frost and Shock. You can also make more at the forge, or spawn more in the lab.
  
\*Ring of the Time Lords in ring container. Gives constant time slow down while worn.
  
\*When crouched, activating the gold strongbox adds the selected amount of gold coins to it.
  
\*Clocks to show the current game time, month, day of week and the date.
  
\*Pull Chain that will empty all auto-sort containers back to your inventory (including ingredients), Display containers (will not remove visual effects), crafting safes, insect jars and most all mannequins. It will also stop the quest scripts from running so you can reset or remove the mod. This will stop the clocks as well.
  
\*Holiday decorations!
  
-Frost Fall - Harvest festival!
  
-Evening Star - Christmas decorations.
  
-First Seed - Easter eggs. Includes 'Colored Egg Hunt' game. Activate the basket in the tower top to start the game. Ten random colored eggs will be hidden in 50 different random locations in the 'Basement'. Find all 10 eggs to get a 'Golden Egg' from the basket. Special egg mesh with golden shine to it, plus its worth 500 gold coin!
  
   
\*BASEMENT\*-----------   
\*Auto-sorter for your ingredients. If your crouching when you activate the auto-sort button, it will remove all ingredients from the jars and place them back into your inventory.
  
\*Ingredient Jars - Each ingredient has its own 'named' container. If your crouched (sneaking) when you activate the individual jars, it will add the 'set' quantity of that ingredient to the container.
  
\*Ingredient Quantity button will let you set how many ingredients spawn in the individual jars. See the line above this about ingredient jars.
  
\*Storage chest wing for general storage needs.
  
\*Displays set up for Shield/Weapon racks, Mannequin's, Book shelves, Display cases.
  
\*Combat Dummy - Gives you experience if you hit it, to the skill you have currently equipped in your "right hand". If you activate the dummy, it will tell how much experience you gained from each skill. NOTE: Attacking with your 'left' had will give experience based on whats in your 'right' hand.
  
\*Crafting - Arcane Enchanter, Grain Mill (grinds human or troll skulls into bonemeal, and Mammoth tusks into powdered Mammoth tusk), Alchemy Lab, Tanning Rack, Work Bench, Grind Stone, Blacksmith's Forge (is the only forge that can make all the weapons and armor found in the levelers tower's), Smelter and Cooking Spit.

\*CHANGE LOG\*   
-------------------
  
11/27/2016 - V4.4 - Release
  
\* Created recipes for un-enchanted versions of the ring, necklace, Draugr armor, sword, bow. Now you can enchant them with whatever you like and they will not be auto-sorted away from you, since they are mod added items.
  
\* Increased the Ambrosia duration so it should not run out in the middle of what your doing.
  
\* The pumpkins are back! They are for the Frostfall holidays.
  
\* Spell 'Harvester' will now auto-pick some DLC flora as well. Items that are 'trees' in the game, such as the Scathcraw, cannot be dynamically added to the harvester form-list, so you will have to continue manually picking some items.
  
\* The teleport home spell has some new locations added for 'Solstheim', ' Dawnguard' and Hearthfires (Unique menu).
  
\* Auto-sorting - DLC added! The only draw back is that its very, very slow. Its about a minute, but it seems longer.

\* Donation poster updated. Version number poster updated.
  
\* Removed timelord ring from container. You can still make one if you wish, but since slo-mo is hosed in SSE, its not supported anymore.

\* Teleports to DLC Dawnguard for 'Unknown book' locations. (Easter Egg room)
  
\* Levelers spells, Fire, Frost and Shock, new level IV of the spell added. Adjusted player level requirements to 0 (I), 25 (II), 50 (III) and 75 (IV).
  
\* In Battle Arena, fixed mesh on blood bowl so its now visible and moves correctly.
  
\* Teleport Home Spell - 'Cities' changed to 'Towns'. A new menu added to Towns for new towns Karthwasten, Dragon Bridge and Shor's Stone. General clean up and reorganization of the menus.
  
\* Removed hard coded destination for Teleport Home Spell. Now uses dynamic locations so no changes happen to the location cells.

\* Clock fixes in tower top.
  
\* Added auto-sort from container.

\* Battle Arena - Added button for races (as bandits). Helpful when you need their blood for a quest.
  
\* Horse armors re-added to Night Mare (summonable horse).
  
11/06/2016 - V4.2 - More bug fixes.
  
\* Added 'ready' buttons to Torture Chamber Maze game.
