This mod is a thorough rework of [Breezehome Crafting Basement](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2035) by [Kalanaed](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/39333035). It started as an attempt to fix some little issues, then it evolved while I was learning the Creation Kit, with the addition of a number of features and improvements (I think) aimed to more immersion and completeness in crafting opportunities for a low level character as for a veteran Dragonborn.
  
  
Some features of my rework are, as now:
  
  

  
* Fixed some mesh alignments and lights, added smoke and fog where I felt they were needed
Added a hole on the ceiling for the smelter's smoke to go out (no more choking and breathing CO)
  
  
* Added air vents in all rooms (they are underground with no windows, and a lot of lighted fires)
Added a magical sun-like light source in the "greenhouse" room to help crops grow underground (I wondered how they could before)
  
  
* Enlarged the mining room and made some mushrooms grow there (it seemed logical)
Added some furniture to Mercata's shop and bedroom
  
  
* Added some objects to Mercata's selling chest (to help crafting further objects)
Added a "convenience room" to Mercata's bedroom (poor woman, she must have her needs too...)
  
  
* Added a Staff Enchanter workbench (for the wanting wizards)
Added a secret entrance/exit directly from/to Skyrim (three doors less to reach the world)
  
  

For the users of the original mod, the upgrade from version 3.4.0 should be safe because no objects were deleted and the original containers and furniture were all retained.
