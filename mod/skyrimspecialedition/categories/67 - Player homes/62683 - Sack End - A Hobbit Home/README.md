Sack End is an atmospheric well lit home. Featuring a garden, two fireplaces, a living room, kitchen, bedroom, a small pantry, two hallways and a cellar. The home has all the crafting utilities you could need stowed away in the cellar. There is full cooking equipment, as hobbits like their food and their second breakfasts. There are books, storage, a place to sit and relax or a warm bed to sleep in after a hard days adventuring. The location is idyllic, offering scenic views and an interesting place to watch the world go by from the comforts of your own hobbit sized garden.
