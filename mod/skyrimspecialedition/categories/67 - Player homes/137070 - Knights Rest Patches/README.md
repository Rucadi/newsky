I just installed Skyrimlazz's wonderful [Knight's Rest](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19793) in my load order after freeing up some slots, and noticed it needed a few patches for the other mods in my load order. While I was at it, I cleaned up and fixed the exterior navmesh, which had some connection issues with adjacent cells.
  
  
I left the predator spawn on the road because honestly it is a bit funny. Without player intervention the denizens of Knight's Rest are quite safe from the Wolves/Sabertooth/Bear/Spider as they've closed up the front gate. They'll happily watch you kill the scary animal from the safety of their walls.
  
  
Currently supported mods / patches:
  
  
Navmesh Tweaks - Fixes the exterior navmesh to have better cell connections, adds a few idle markers around the outside as well. NPCs will no longer get stuck on the road, failing to path at the border between cells.
  
  
Lux Via - Cleans up the crashed wagon (which would be floating) and updates the exterior lighting to match Lux Via values/lanterns.
  
Lux - Makes the interiors use Lux lighting.
  
Lux Orbis - Adds Lux Orbis lighting / lanterns to the porches.
  
  
That's it! It's a simple mod page, but I have it up so I can add any future patches I make to it.
