Lahar can now be asked to swap out the Shrine of Zenithar in the Main Hall with a different shrine of your choice at any time.
  
  
Simply talk to him about doing some work around the castle, where the new dialogue can be found.
  
  
Currently supports the shrines of all Nine Divines.
  
  
DLC shrines may come at a later date.
