**Seeker's Solace**
  
  
"Seekers solace is a series of towers to the west of Winterhold that has been owned by many a mage or arcanist in years past in the ultimate pursuit of knowledge. There have been rumors of strange magics radiating from the fortress as well, drawing many more to attempt to discover and claim the secrets hiding within."
  
  
I've always loved the idea of a mage tower, and Seekers solace is my attempt at making one! this is my first player home I've made from scratch uploaded to the Nexus, and I had a lot of fun working on and living in it over the course of my own mage playthrough! I sincerely hope you enjoy as well if you give it a download!

- An entryway Library that has teleports to move quickly around the towers (and a few "secret" entrances")
