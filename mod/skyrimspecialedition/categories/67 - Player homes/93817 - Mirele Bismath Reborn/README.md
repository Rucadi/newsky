**-BACKSTORY LORE-**

  
  
Extract from "A Brief History of Falkreath" by Senicus Clutecus - Chapter 8 - Mirele Bismath Tower
  
  
"This wizard's tower, standing watch over the White River, was originally constructed as a watch tower during the many Imperial invasions of Skyrim. The tower was used by its Imperial occupiers to extract tolls from travelers along the road to Riverwood, as well as a barracks and temporary dungeon for a while. But after a rebellious uprising from the local Nords of Falkreath, the tower was ransacked and abandoned, left by the embittered locals to ruin.
  
  
After a time the Tower slowly began to crumble, until a certain mage by the name of Folms Mirel, wandered upon the ruin and decided to make it his home. This Dunmer mage made extensive improvements and added the wooden structures that form the turret and additional rooms, as can be seen today. [size=3]Mirel was highly secretive, and sequestered himself away for years, perfecting the art of teleportation, in which he specialized. It is said that the solitary mage also acquired an extensive collection of old and arcane texts during his years of isolation.
  
  
Despite Mirel's good intentions, his solitary nature did nothing to ease the suspicions of the local Nords, and they grew distrustful of this foreign mage living among them.  Sensing the growing anti-elf sentiment, and mistrust of magic spreading across Skyrim, the gifted mage decided it was the right time to leave, and return to his homeland.
  
  
After years of sitting empty, Jarl Siddgeir has agreed that the house is long overdue for a new owner. Whoever makes this mysterious tower their home will have to win the trust of the local superstitious populace, for rumors still abound that the tower itself has the power to teleport people or objects far away, all across Skyrim. But of course, these are just the murmurings of simple Nords, and should be given no heed..."

**-MOD DESCRIPTION****-**

  
Mirele Bismath is a 2 bedroom Player Home geared towards mid-game and onwards. The original home is the creation of [SoftRodvt](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/2333291) I have given the home a complete visual redesign, while keeping all the original benefits and features (At the permission of SoftRodvt of course).
  
  
**FEATURES:**

  
* An Autosorting system, to sort your ~~trash~~ loot!
Every cooking and crafting station, so you can have a centralized crafting hub!
  
* A lore-friendly and fun fast travel alternative, geared for mages playing without fast travel(i.e. CC Survival Mode)
Multiple forms of displaying your items, including (but not limited to) 
  
Bookshelves, Unique item shelves, Dragon Priest busts, Mannequins, etc.* Full compatibility with [Hearthfire Multiple Adoptions](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3862/)﻿, allowing you to move your family in!
Full compatibility with tax-collecting mods, such as [Simple Taxes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14216)﻿!
  
* Fully navmeshed and cleaned, to ensure compatibility and polish when bringing family and followers inside!
Dramatic lighting, designed to look good even with vanilla lighting! (Looks best with ELFX !)
  

  
**Additional changes in Reborn version:**

  
* Extensive redesign, inside and out!
New bedroom, crafting area and generally more spacious (While still keeping with the original cozy feeling!)
  
* New herb garden, additional follower bedroom, balcony, bathroom and reading room.
The basement has been redesigned as an Arcane Vault, housing an extensive collection of Arcane lore.
  

  
I hope you find the home comfortable and accommodating! A huge thank you to the mods original author, [size=3][SoftRodvt](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/2333291) for making my favorite player home, and allowing me to edit it![/size]

**-COMPATIBILITY-**Should be compatible with most mods, obviously anything that edits the same cell will not be compatible. The mod makes a very small change to the Guardian stones' cell (Moves 1 tree to the side, so the tower can be seen in the distance while at the standing stones). This should not cause an issue, as an example, Ryn's Standing stones mod works perfectly with this home.
  
  

**[size=4]-**

BUGS / ISSUES- 
  
The house uses dynamic lighting, to some it may look gloomy inside during the night, this isn't a bug as the light from the windows will get brighter during daylight hours.
  
The fog effects inside depend upon the weather outside, so if it's misty outside, it may also appear misty inside.
  
The bathtub in the washroom is currently for show only, it doesn't have "Keep it Clean" support.
  
There are many tree mods that add dense trees around this area of the map, some of these may clip intot he Bridge, please use the following command to remove unwanted trees (Thanks [VikkDamone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/41469700) for mentioning this!)
  
  
**Remove unwanted trees:**
  
1)Stand in front of the house looking at the tree that's clipping with the bridge.
  
2)Save your game.
  
3)Open the console and with the mouse button click on the tree and a ID for
  
the tree should pop up. Type Disable and the tree is gone. Incase you
  
zapped the wrong item reload your save game.

Personal comment from SoftRodvt : [font=Georgia]"I first played Morrowind during a rough time in my life; I had just gotten back into elementary school after a period of homelessness, living out of my Dad's car in the Southwest. We'd moved in with my great-grandparents, and my family had pooled together enough money for me to get an Xbox for my birthday. I wasn't too impressed with the bundled NCAA Football game, so my Dad took me to GameCrazy/Hollywood Video to rent some cool looking  video games. I saw Morrowind GOTY on that shelf, and haven't ever been the same since."[/font]
