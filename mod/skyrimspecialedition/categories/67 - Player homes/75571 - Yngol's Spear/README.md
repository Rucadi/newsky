*If you're anything like me, you've long wanted a player home that felt secure and defensible (Skyrim is a great place for making enemies, after all) without being oversized or totally incompatible with Skyrim lore. A convenient safe haven where you can dump your wealth and urchins, without worrying that the Whiterun drunk will stumble in at 4 am and help himself to a Daedric artifact from a wall display. Grand and impressive without being a sprawling maze. A balance between aesthetics and utility.
  
  
If so, this could be the player home for you.*The above description is from my other castle mod, [Heartwood Castle](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48050), but it applies equally well here! Yngol's Spear is a fortified player home near Windhelm that should meet all your storage and crafting needs, as well as being a home for your followers and children (N.B. you will need [Hearthfire Multiple Adoptions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3862?tab=description) and / or [My Home Is Your Home](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7096?tab=description), to do this, or other mods with similar functionality), without being tiresome to navigate. Yngol's Spear includes several features for ease of use as well, such as an automatically opening and closing portcullis and a recall spell to teleport you, your follower, and your mount back to the castle. This home should feel fairly true to the look and spirit of the vanilla game.

Room for a spouse, six children, and six followers (five if you choose to employ a steward)
  
* Hireable steward with daily routine (check the ledger on the left as you enter the player's quarters)
Open-plan feasting hall, with galleried rooms for followers and children, plus kitchens
  
* Separate upstairs area with the player's quarters, library, and enchanting / alchemy stations
Undercroft with forge, armoury, vault, and prison cells
  
* Bath / pool with adjustable water features (NPCs will automatically undress and dress on entering and leaving the baths)
Roof terrace and balcony overlooking Eastmarch
  
* Mannequins and various weapon racks and plaques for displaying your gear
All the usual crafting stations and plenty of linked, named, and generic storage for flexibility
  
* Stables, chickens, hearthfire-style planters
Training dummies, and archery targets
  
* Automatically opening and closing portcullis
Recall spell to return you, your follower, and your mount to the castle
  
* Interior and exterior fully navmeshed

  
As always, I am not a completionist, and as I made this mod for one of my own playthroughs, I have not incorporated unique displays for all the items you could conceivably collect over the course of your game. Nonetheless, there is plenty of named and unnamed storage to shape and adapt to your needs. It is also worth noting that my aim was to use assets from the standard game and official DLCs wherever possible; the castle should have a fairly vanilla feel to it as a result.
  
  
  
**LOCATION AND HOW TO GET IT**
  
  
Yngol's Spear is perched on the mountainside above and to the northwest of Windhelm, just a short ride from the city. It can be found by following the west road out of the city, through Anga's Mill, and then turning right at the mammoth skull. Depending on your graphics settings, you'll be able to see it above Anga's Mill as you approach from the west, south, or east.
  
  
The castle is guarded by a handful of bandits. The interior initially contains with two bedrolls, one chest, and a cooking station, and is in an obvious state of disrepair; you can renovate the castle using the tools to the left of the main entrance - this will cost 20,000 septims and advance the game time by a day or so.
  
  
There is a key for the exterior doors and the cells in the undercroft. You can find the key (1) on the table to the right in the entrance hall, (2) next to the ledger in the player's quarters, and (3) on the table by the cells.

**COMPATIBILITY**
  
  
This player home has been tested across a number of characters, and is compatible and recommended for use with [Hearthfire Multiple Adoptions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3862?tab=description). You may also wish to use one of the many excellent follower mods out there, such as [My Home Is Your Home](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7096?tab=description),﻿ to rehome your favourite followers in the castle, along with [Multiple Floors Sandboxing](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4524) to encourage more natural behaviours for anyone you do relocate.
  
  
The castle is unlikely to be compatible with other mods that alter the same cells next to Anga's Mill. Let me know if you encounter conflicts, or indeed if other nearby mods work fine.
  
  
A patch for [Skyrim is Luminous](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/110471) can be found in the optional files section.
  
  
  
**INSTALLATION**Install in the usual way: I recommend using [Mod Organizer 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194) or [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) (preferably the former) for ease and transparency. Be very wary of uninstalling mods mid-game - even lightweight player home mods like this one - as unintended behaviours can result. My advice if you're unsure would be to hold onto a save from before you installed a given mod, and revert to it if you change your mind.
  
  
  
**FEEDBACK**Please let me know in the comments if you encounter any bugs or have any other feedback.
