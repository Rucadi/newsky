**Building items too fast and not allowing the screen to fade to black after each item is built can cause items to sometimes not appear.
  
Some activators may not work once they're built, simply exit the ship then re-enter for the cell to refresh.
  
The Hireable Deckhands may sometimes get lost and need time to show up at the exterior of the ship when traveling with the Ship Travel system, simply travel during the evening or night while they are in the interior of the ship or enter the ship and wait a few in game hours for them to re-appear.**
