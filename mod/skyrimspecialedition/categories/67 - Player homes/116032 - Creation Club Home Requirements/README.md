**Overview**
  
  
This mod is just what it says on the box. If you're like me, you don't like to have unbalanced or overpowered content available to you almost immediately into a new playthrough. Unfortunately, most CC homes seem to share this problem. [Homes Under the Warhammer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67444/) fixes this problem by adding lore friendly requirements to the homes, so that players can't access them too early. But several modules have issues that prevent the quests from properly progressing, or allowing players to access them immediately. I've taken those ideas, tweaked them slightly , and reimplemented them in ways that fixes the original issues.
  
  
  
**Bloodchill Manor**
  
  
SpoilerFor this home, you'll need to complete the "Bloodline" quest in the Dawnguard DLC before being receiving your invitation to dinner. The quest will then proceed normally.
  
  
**Hendraheim**
  
  
SpoilerFor this home, you'll need to complete the "The Silver Hand" quest and join the Circle of the Companions before being summoned by Eydvina for a fight. The quest will then proceed normally.
  
  
**Gallows Hall**
  
  
SpoilerFor this home, Gallows Hall will remain locked until you've completed the Conjuration Ritual Spell quest. Afterwards, the entrance will open and the quest will progress normally.
  
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
  
**This mod is not compatible with any mod that makes changes to the CC quests that this mod touches. At least not without a patch.**
  
  
If you prefer to use **[CC Hendraheim - Tweaks and Enhancements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98688)**over the base creation, I've made a patch to allow it to work with this mod.
  
  
This mod is strictly incompatible with [Rebalancing Anniversary Edition - Quest Requirements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61004), but they can be safely used together as long as you load my mods last.
