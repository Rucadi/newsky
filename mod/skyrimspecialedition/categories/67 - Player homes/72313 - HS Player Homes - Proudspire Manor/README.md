﻿**Description**﻿

  
  
This mod overhauls Proudspire Manor, the default player home located in Solitude. This overhaul aims to create a warmer home for the Dragonborn and its family, reworking the initial floor-plan to add some additional space to original house. The mod makes almost entirely use of Skyrim assets with a few custom-made meshes to fit the needs of the house. it should be compatible with most HD re-meshes and re-textures out there as long as they stay close to the original shapes they are replacing. I am using a few myself and have not come across any problems so far.

**Compatibility**

  
  
I will list here some of the mods for which compatibility issues have been reported, these would require a patch to work properly.
  
  

**Disclaimer**

  
It is highly advisable to run this mod on a new play-through or before visiting Proudspire Manor, otherwise you will have to pick up a lot of mess from the floor and some activators and collision boxes such as bookshelves and weapon racks might be set to their original location and not work properly.
  
  
Obviously, this mod will conflict with other mods that would change the Proudspire Manor interior cell / porch and garden in any significant way.
