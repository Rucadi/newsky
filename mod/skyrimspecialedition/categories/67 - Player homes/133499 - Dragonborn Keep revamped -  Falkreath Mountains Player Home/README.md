My personal player home, I made years ago. I'm using it on every playthrough and over the years I added a lot of rooms for ambience, storage and followers, because I like to have 5 followers with me and another 15 running around in my player home. It started as a plain copy of Riften Castle that was originally located next to Whiterun (see [old mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31919)), but it grew a lot over the years and I moved it to Falkreath. I use it with Nether's Follower Framework to assign my followers to certain locations of the keep (wizards to arcanaeum, warriors to forge etc)
  
  
**Update Warning:**
  

  
* I recommend saving the game somewhere outside (away from the keep) before updating the mod
Check the changelogs before updating. If the changelogs state that weapon plaques/racks have been changed, you should remove all weapons from the plaques/racks of the mentioned room (other rooms are safe)
  

  
**Features:**

  
* teleport marker
you can fast travel from inside the keep
  
* a lot of storage
has everything, an adventurer needs (smithy, armory, bedrooms, storage, planters)
  
* space for you and 31 followers (15 on main floor, 16 in basement, +3 children on main floor)
a nice outdoor living room on the balcony to enjoy the view
  
* all nav meshed so your followers can reach everything
a lot of idle markes. Your companions will lean on walls, sit on ledges, sit in the pool, etc
  
* multiple adoptions compatible (mod is only required if you want to use adoption)

  
**Rooms: (main cell)**
  

  
* Main Hall / Feast Hall

* children's bedroom for up to 3 children

  
**Armory: (extra cell)**
  

  
* extra cell (so players can choose if they want to use mannequins and also for performance reasons)
19 mannequins, ~50 weapon plaques, chests for storing more stuff 
  
* Cave: (extra cell)
a large cave with hot springs to hang out or to use as a home for animal companions
  
* 11 planters (soil spots) to grow herbs and plants
iron ore vein and moonstone vein
  
* smelter

  
**Basement (extra cell):**
  

  
* a basement room with another 16 beds if you need more space or if you want to split your followers for performance reasons (loading times)
Compatibility:
  
* should be compatible with every mod that doesn't change Angi's Camp or the cell next to it (-8/-26)
compatible with Multiple Adoptions (mod is not a requirement)
  

  
**Known Bugs/Issues:**
  

  
* on the balcony, in the corner behind the right brazier there's the world boundary, so if you try to go behind the brazier (you probably won't) the game will tell you that you can't go that way. I would have to move the whole keep with all the invisble marker to fix that tiny corner. It's just not worth the effort.
updating cells/rooms can sometimes lead to items beeing misplaced (weapon racks hanging too low, statues facing the wrong direction etc.). You can usually fix that by wating for 24 hours somewhere outside or you open the console, click on the misplaced item and type recycleactor
  
* weapons can't be picked up from a plaque/rack: This is most often an issue with the weapon, not with the plaque. You can use TCL command, fly behind the wall and pick up the weapon from the side (you need to hit the right angle).
