﻿ **- Description -**

[/font]
  
This mod overhauls Vlindrel Hall, the default player home located in Markarth. This overhaul aims to create a warmer home for the Dragonborn and its family, reworking the initial floor-plan to add some additional space to the original house. The mod makes almost entirely use of Skyrim assets with a few custom-made meshes to fit the needs of the house. it should be compatible with most HD re-meshes and re-textures out there as long as they stay close to the original shapes they are replacing. I am using a few myself and have not come across any problems so far.

﻿ **- Acquisition -**

[/font]
  

  
* The house can be acquired by completing Jarl Igmund's request and helping 5 people in the Hold.
Furnishing the house requires you to buy the upgrades from the steward.
  
* A new system has been put in place to buy the upgrades. Instead of having to navigate through a dialogue menu, the upgrades will be listed through a vendor interface. As a result, Bartering will apply to the price of the upgrades.
