Fast travelling somewhere to upgrade your stuff or store something is a pain.
  
3 loading screens to get to your crib is annoying.
  
So, I bring you another home in your pocket. Bring it anywhere, visit it any time.

**[b][color=#00ff00]Info**[/color][/b]
  
﻿I've been modding Skyrim for about 2 years and slowly getting more comfortable with the Creation Kit.
  
As I did, I slowly expanded the Dwemer Storage ﻿Cube into what it is now. It's wildly different.
  
It's not really a cube anymore. It's huge.
  
In fact, I renamed it in game to **A Dwemer Storage Dimension.**
  
  
Basically A Dwemer Storage Dimension is a miscellaneous item in your inventory.
  
 You click it and you're teleported to the location.
  
Click it again, and you teleport back to your previous location. 
  
Is it cheating? DON'T TELL ME HOW TO PLAY MY GAME.  
  
  
**The cube is behind the counter of Arnleif and Sons in Markarth or you can obtain it through [Simple Mod Item Spawner](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64653)﻿ or [AddItemMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17563).**
  
  
**NOTE: To get to the second area of the home, you need to go through the cave and hang a left - the cave exit is a small space between 2 dwemer boilers.**
  
  
**Credits/Requirements:****There are only 3 firm and 2 really really recommended requirements. All the requirements are listed under the "Requirements" Tab.**
  
﻿I really like [Mandragorasprouts](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Mandragorasprouts/mods?gameId=1704)' statues (you'll see). 3 of his mods are requirements. If you aren't using them then you're freakin' blowing it. If downloading this mod is what ﻿makes you finally download his statues, you're welcome. I asked him about using his mods and he was fine with it. I also grabbed a bit of his Namira's ﻿shrine cave location and used it for part of the mod.
  
  
﻿I have several Dibella statues around the home, and I used [PSBoss' Dibella statue](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51983). I recommend to install it. The home will use whatever replacer you ﻿have installed (or vanilla if you don't have any replacers installed), but the way I have some fountains structured it won't look right unless you have ﻿PSBoss' mod installed. I don't think I need permission, but I asked anyways and PSBoss is good with it. 
  
  
﻿You're going to need to download [Dwemer Pipework Reworked](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46507) as well. I placed a ton of dwemer pipes all over the place, and you're really going to need it ﻿installed to avoid clipping and to get the intended effect. 
  
  
﻿I also need to credit [KaXaK](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/kaxak/about-me?gameId=110) ﻿for his mod [KxK Apocrypha Home](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50939/). With his permission, I used part of his structure for a large section of the mod.
  
His mod isn't required, but you should check it out.
  
  
﻿Shoutout to [HyliosSykes](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/HyliosSykes/mods?gameId=1704) (all of their mods are fantastic). I was heavily inspired by his bath in Jorrvaskr for part of the home. 
  
  
**UPDATE 1.2 - Added a custom floor mesh and texture. Credit to****[uArtt](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/uArtt/about-me?gameId=1704) and his****[Art's Solitude Streets](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/111362) mod. His textures have open permissions, using his gray version. It's the floor in the screenshots.**
  
  
﻿I placed several sitting/leaning/meditating markers around the home which you can use if you have [Dovahkiin can lean](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32748) installed.
  
[SonderBain](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/SonderBain/mods?gameId=1704) has some really good animations for idle markers.
  
There are some cool animations for meditating by [Xtudo](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/109935) and [CHIMgarden](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76889).
  
  
﻿There are a lot of plants/blackreach mushrooms around, and I recommend the following:
  

  
* [﻿﻿Deathbell by Mari](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37869)
[ENB Light for Deathbell by Mari](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73349)﻿﻿﻿
  
* [Rally's Blackreach Mushrooms](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29179)﻿
[Berrybog's Blackreach Bush](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89057)
  
* [Animated Blackreach Mushrooms](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86128/)﻿﻿

  
﻿﻿Shoutout to [RogueUnicorn00](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/RogueUnicorn00/mods?gameId=1704) who helped me make all of the plants non-harvestable
  
(like they do in their City Trees mod, which is great).
  
Due to what kind ﻿of cell this is, the plants won't respawn at all.
  
So to prevent accidental harvesting I used this method. 
  
  
﻿For the fire effects I use [Inferno](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29316)and [Embers HD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14368)﻿.
  
I think you should be fine if you're using Vanilla or Embers XD as well. 
  
  
I use [ERM - Enhanced Rocks and Mountains](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85196).
  
I have a lot of mountain ridges in the cell. I don't think ERM changes the meshes too much from vanilla,
  
but ﻿you might have some clipping if you don't use ERM. 
  
  
﻿I use [Water for ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37061) and [Rally's Water Foam](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28922).
  
Without those installed the water effects may not look totally right.
  
(It may look wonky with Natural ﻿Waterfalls installed as well, I don't use that mod). 
  
  
The main part of my mod uses textures from the Solitude streets and Whiterun City walls.
  
I linked the ones I used below, the mod will use whichever ones you have installed. 
  
 
  
**More info**
  
This is just an ESP and a BSA from the original Dwemer Storage Cube. The ESP is obviously heavily modified, but the BSA is untouched. That being said, ﻿this mod is going to use whatever textures/meshes you have installed. ﻿I'll link the textures I have installed below (they are all really good). 
  
  
It's not navmeshed, and the bedrooms can't be used to house children or followers.
  
I'm a noob and don't know how any of that works. If anyone wants to ﻿help with it, I'm open to learning.
  
  
﻿Several of the rooms in the Apocrypha portion of the home aren't really finished. I ran out of ideas and just threw some cool looking stuff into them.
  
If you have any ideas for me I can work on making them into something, or you can hop into the Creation Kit and modify them yourself.
  
  
﻿Do I know what I'm doing? No, no I don't. But I think the home looks cool. Is it original? Meh, kinda. I put a lot of work into it but it was inspired by other mod author's works which I have credited and obtained permission.

**Misc**
  
  
﻿I'm on Skyrim version 1.5.97, and version 1.5.73 of the Creation Kit is what I used. Basically this should be compatible with all game versions. 
  
  
﻿I placed occlusion planes in several places to help with performance.
  
 ﻿
  
﻿Even though the sky is visible, this is an interior cell. You won't get any weather effects but the sky will change based on time of day.
  
It also doesn't use sky lighting, so your lighting in the mod will mostly depend on your interior lighting mods (I use Lux).
  
It's pretty bright with Cabbage ENB. Without ENB and Lux it's dark, but I placed enough lights around that you can still see perty good.
  
(Hopefully no flickering). 
  
  
﻿Initially I never planned to publish this mod. Over time and as it got bigger, I decided to look into it.
  
A Dwemer Storage Cube has open permissions and I ﻿obtained permission from other author's work that I used. So here it is. 
  
  
﻿Hopefully there aren't any issues, but let me know if you run into anything.
  
You really might want to hop into the Creation Kit to tune the lighting/image space to your ﻿liking/based on your lighting mods.
  
I'm happy to help walk you through that if you want. (It's easy).
