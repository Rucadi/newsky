This is a portable snow globe house. During your adventure, you can rest in the snow globe house in your pocket and then return to where you were to continue your adventure.There are two types of snow globes, so you can use whichever you prefer.
  
  
**This mod also works with Skyrim SE.**
  
Due to specification changes, this mod is not compatible with the previously released mod. Please use either one.
  
  
**Installation**
  
When you install the mod, two misc items, the Alchemy Globe and the Snow Globe, will be into your inventory.
  
  
**How to use**
  
Activate the snow globe in your inventory.
  
When you close your inventory, you will be taken to your respective Snow globe house.
  
If you want to go back to where you were, activate the Snow Globe in your inventory again.
  
Alternatively, you can return to your original location by using the portal orb next to the door. If you have inadvertently thrown away your Snow Globe at the original location or put it away in a chest of drawers, you can still return to the original location through this portal.
  
  
**Emergency Exit**
  
If you find yourself going back and forth between portals and can no longer return to your original world, use the emergency exit.
  
You will not be able to return to your original location, but you will be able to move to Whiterun.
