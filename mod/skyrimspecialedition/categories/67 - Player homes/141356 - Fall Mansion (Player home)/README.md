This is a player home that I started work on a few years back, which finally decided to at last complete to some basic degree and publish it.
  
  
The house has a cosy central area with a fire place, and a loft with a bed. It also has a kitchen with another loft housing plenty of space for eventual followers (which you would likely have to use another mod to have move into the house).
  
From there on I kinda lost the plot and added a cave bath, a cave system with mines and smithing, as well as a Dwemer chamber acting as a museum and throan room. Finally, the house has a child-room (for eventual adopted children).
