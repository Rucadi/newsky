**---------------Blackthorn Town Income System-------------------**
  
As of Version 1.5 hiring various Shop Merchants, Inn Keeper, Grounds Keeper and adding Citizen Npcs at the interior workbenches after building the various buildings at the Blackthorn Trader workbench will allow you to collect town income through various profit/rent chests located in the Study of Blackthorn Manor or in the interiors of each shop, houses and the mine.
  
  
Mine - 160 Gold every 48 hours - Hire Miners from the Mine Workbench (Chest located beside the main entrance)

**Notes/Tips**
  
Building Blackthorn is meant to be a large buildable project that WILL take time to finish.
  
The workbench and cheat supply chest enable/disable button style activators in the Master Bedroom must be pressed twice when first using in order for the change to take place.
  
I've added various woodpiles on the exterior of some buildings that contain firewood supplies. (They do respawn)
  
For immersion, I've left all road patrols and vanilla enemy encounter zones alone so people will attack and patrol through the town. (Hire Guards at the Guard Barracks workbench to protect the town)
  
The 1st floor workbenches in Blackthorn Manor, Edgewater Inn have build options for the exterior.
  
Building items too fast and not allowing the screen to fade to black after each item is built can cause items to sometimes not appear.
  
Some users may experience a slight FPS drop when first entering Blackthorn Manor when it's fully furnished (mainly due to mannequins),
  
waiting 10-15 seconds when first entering the home should return the FPS to normal after everything has time to load..

Version 1.1:
  
Fixed flickering/graphical bugs in the basement of Blackthorn Manor along with other missing textures from other objects around the town.
