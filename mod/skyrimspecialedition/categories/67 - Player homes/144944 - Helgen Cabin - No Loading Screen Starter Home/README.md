A new mod that's outside of my comfort zone. one I have never done or even tried before, A player home. Not just any player home, a no loading door player home. Well by golly with the help of some of my great friends in the modding community, and some open permissions asset packs it is complete! This has been the most fun I've had modding this game, ever. The cabin's features are as follows:
  

  
* *a scripted door that closes, and locks 10 seconds after you enter, or leave. To prevent wanderer's invading the cabin.*
*an enchanting station*
  
* *a custom-made fireplace model*
*an alchemy station*
  
* *a custom-made stained-glass window, mesh created by Oaristys for Modder Resource Pack, altered by me & disintinerant, texture completely made by disintinerant, thank you.*
*a custom weapons container*
  
* *a custom armor storage container*
*a safe*
  
* *a full farm with wheat, potato, gourds, and leeks.*
*Some stormcloak training dummies*
  
* *a small amount of lore and backstory of the previous owner. A small quest.*
*an amazing interior mostly developed by Wheelabout. Thank you, friend.*

*I recommend some texture overhaul for windhelm. The cabin specifically uses windhelm interior log meshes. There are some nice ones on nexus:*

  
* *[Riton Windhelm](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/101287)﻿*
*[Northfire's Windhelm](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44099)﻿*
  

*I recommend some stockade texture overhaul; the best one I know of is [Tomato's wood](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/115201)*.
  
*I recommend installing this mod before starting your game, if you don't, you'll be locked out of the quest.

To start the quest, travel to the crossroads between Helgen and Riverwood. Just up the road from the guardian stones. There will be a dead body. Loot the note from the body and read it.
  
For the last part of the quest, it can be a little bit confusing... Here is a spoiler to help:
  
Spoiler
  
The note, and quest journal allude to "roots that cradle the cliffs edge" this refer to a stump located behind the cabin, just atop a cliff. Also if you can't find the cabin... It's across the road from the bandit camp

**Future Plans(Ordered by priority):**
  
These are things I am thinking of doing in future updates, it does not necessarily mean they are 100% happening.[/i]

  
* *Make a secret tunnel escape that leads down to the lake (illinalta) below. {Thanks for idea Panda)*
