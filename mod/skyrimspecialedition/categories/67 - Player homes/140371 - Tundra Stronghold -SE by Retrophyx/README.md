***TUNDRA STRONGHOLD*****[size=5][b]~~~~~~~~~~~~**
  
*Hello, all. It's finally here after months of work. Tundra Stronghold is a brand new home inspired by Daggerfall and Arena. This home is furnished in a more ancient design fitting for the region of the Whiterun Tundra. With a huge tower overlooking the plains, guards to watch your home, and npcs to compliment your stay. This is the latest in my work of level design, and I hope everyone enjoys it.* [/b][/size]

*Design Backstory*
  
So I've been in a mood to do more mods that compliment Skyrim's vanilla theme.
  
I was inspired by Heart of Skyrim by Braiven as well as Tes 2 Daggerfall.
  
I made this home to naturally cater to the Tundra region, while the inside mimics a Daggerfall royal castle.
  
The lore is that this use to be Castle Blackmoor, but has since been long forgotten.
  
The citizens of Whiterun Hold still maintain the grounds and preserve the ancient culture.
  
The Keep is meant to look like it's actually old, it's not meant to look like it was built yesterday.
