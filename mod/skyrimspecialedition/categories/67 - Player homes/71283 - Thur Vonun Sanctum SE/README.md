THUR VONUN DOOM LAGOON (SANCTUM)
  
An outlet of one or several cave shaft systems descending deep into the unknown bowels of tamriel﻿.Doom lagoon; where one outlet begins, loath a nursery of killer slaughterfish that will not attack you and your allies.
  
However; these fish hunger and kill all other on sight.
  
  
DOOM DETAINMENT TELEPORT SPELL:

  
* The spell (Doom Lagoon Upper Level) is where the fun begins. Once the spell has been picked up; the framework behind Doom Lagoon awakens granting you have the ability to kidnap your prisoners. Cast your new power on Target Actors and make your capture choices when prompted. Upon Sanctum load when prisoners have been sentenced to a cage; sometimes, they may be in another cage then where you sent them. Nothing to be concerned about.
This is a Power like the Miin of Thur: Pathfinders Miiraad Spell. Technically; no matter what level the character is; it can be used. Making it a "Real" Spell; costing Magicka and giving it a Level (Expert, since it's a really, really powerful Spell); would have been more immersive as it really manipulates actors during battle or whenever (OP). Another side of me was saying "I am in control how and when I use it." Be that as it may; to make it more immersive; control its use or don't use it as often as you can. The freedom to use the spell whenever/however without restriction VS. needing to be a high ranked character > I went with the unrestricted approach.
  

  
PRISONER TRACKING SYSTEM:

  
* Every Target Actor that becomes a prisoner of Thur Vonun is branded, keyed and permanently traced.
That Target Actor is then added to the systems max amount of prisoners it can handle at a time (QTY:62).
  
* This max cap amount of prisoners includes prisoners that are alive and/or dead.
If the accumulated amount of prisoners ever reaches max allowed amount; you must do a purge or in other words choose how many of the dead the "Lagoon Digestion System" is to deduct from Thur Vonun.
  
* Upon a Target Actor being subject to the players power, you have the choice to send them to one of the three Doom Lagoon Prisoner Cages or you can leave the Target Actor alone.

  
DOOM PRISONER CAGES:

  
* In the Doom Lagoon on both upper and Lower levels is the lever that harnesses all the actions to be carried out with the cages. You can either:
**(A)** Trip the cage(s) trapdoor floor(s) (one at a time or all at once) dropping the captives into the Doom Lagoon for the fish to feed on
  
**(B)** Blast the cages with power housed fire (one at a time or all at once). The Smelter releases heat, smoke and those elements produced are recycled fueling the Thur Vonun Engine which builds up a mass charge of combustion and the pipes pointing to the cages are its exhausts.* The cages will ONLY allow max (QTY:6) prisoners at a time so you can have a grand total of (QTY:18) prisoners in the cages at once. Entire Prisoner Tracking System max is (QTY:62) and grand total of cage captives at once is (QTY:18 / 6 Per-cage).
Target Actors tracked and sent to Thur Vonun have overridden AI Packages. They will not attempt to combat or fight you when they are caged or when they fall into the Doom Lagoon. Subjected to Doom; they are cowardly, quiet and confused.
  

  
LAGOON DIGESTION SYSTEM:

  
* Lower level of the Doom Lagoon beside the door on the wall is the controller button for the "Lagoon Digestion System".
How it works is Example; if you have (QTY:30) dead bodies in the Lagoon and you activate the switch and choose a (Value:5) at prompt selection; the next time you exit the Sanctum; the Digestion System will fire and remove (QTY:25) of the dead leaving the Lagoon left with (QTY:5) when you return. After all the dead are purged to your (Value:5); up the preset again to a high value so more are allowed once again to accumulate (if desired). 
  
* All the dead bodies the Lagoon digests are teleported to an Utility Cell which harness many uses for Thur Vonun but for the digested; its a garage dump.
As soon as you pickup the "Doom Detainment Teleport Spell" and the framework awakens; the corpse digestion is defaulted to begin its cleanup routine at a value of 10 corpses so make your adjustments any which way you like and whenever you want from the controller button.
  

SMART CASTER VS. BLIND USER **(Do Understand This)**:
  

  
* The Doom Detainment Teleport Power needs to be used with some discernment.
Target Actors that fall within the specified conditions added to the MGEF will **NOT** be teleported. The power wont trigger the prompt when fired upon the following: **SUBJECT IS;** **Child, Commended Actor, Dead, Essential, Protected, has Keyword "NoSoulTrap" or currently tracked by the Prisoner Tracking System**
  
* This is to ensure ONE doesn't compromise their saves after sending important characters because once the Target Actor is sent; there is no sending them back.
Have fun but careful fun. Do at will but be careful with game story actors or actors that are meant to die in accord with the way of the game. My conditions might not cover all the important NPC's so just be cautious.
  
* If you feel like you sent someone to Thur Vonun as a Prisoner you shouldn't have; research on that character and either reload a previous save or maybe its ok and you can continue onward. When I play seriously; I only send Bandits, Draugr, Animals, Giants, the odd Guards and Actors that are okay to die randomly. I have no issues saving after. If I want to send anyone without care (as I often like to do); I will do so knowing not to make a save after.
Know when to save and when not to depending on your choices taken sending Prisoners to Thur Vonun. Your outcomes are 100% dictated by your choices.
  

  
DOOM FORCE BOW AND PROJECTILES:
  

  
* The Bow including all its Projectiles is located in the Doom Lagoon Chest **(bottom level of the Doom Lagoon)**
This bow was built to correct any oddities or funky Target Actor anomalies by Slaughterfish or the prisoners captured in the Doom Lagoon. Obviously; fun as hell to run around and blast actors off cliffs (which I have done countless times building this) but not the reason it was made.
  
* Without causing damage; it will push with force target actors out of there bugged state if something such as so ever materializes in the Doom Lagoon.
All contents that originally are provided in this chest will respawn every 72 hours (approx.) incase the bow gets lost or you run out of ammunition. Nothing added by the player into the Treasure Falmer Chest will be harmed or lost upon the chest refilling itself with the special items it originally comes with. 
  
* The Bow can also be destroyed to learn the Magic Effect and apply to other items without worry the Bow will be gone for good as it will respawn in its home Chest.
Directly on the Back of the Thur Vonun Throne is a Display spot designed for this Bow

AUTO-LOOT CRAFTING STATES:
  
During playthrough; if one wishes to turn off the Auto-Loot Crafting System and just use regular working Crafting Stations; MCM handles that option.
  
  
THUR VONUN AUTO-SORT STORAGE
  
There are two ways to Sort your contents in Thur Vonun:
  
AUTO-SORT MASTER CHEST (QTY:1): **Direct Sorting**
  

  
* The Thur Vonun internal sorting chest (side of the Throne) is the handle that harnesses the Auto-sorting mechanics. Drop your stash into the Sorting Chest and trigger the sorting action by the pull chain. This will fire the Sorting framework distributing all Chest contents to there arrayed home containers (category by category)

THE MIIN OF THUR: PATHFINDERS MIIRAAD POWER: **Remote Sorting**
  

  
* By the use of a learned Power; remote sorting (if depositing items) will drop those items into the Thur Vonun Master Chest. Content can be added or retrieved whenever desired (from anywhere in game) from the Auto-Sort Master Chest so long as an "Initialize Sort" is not executed.
If an "Initialize Sort" is executed; those deposited items are arrayed to there Thur Vonun home containers. Player will need to return to Sanctum to retrieve them. 
  
* Sort remotely based upon items you know you will not need along your travels or do a mega sort before heading back to the Sanctum calculated so when you get home; everything is sorted for you

WHERE ARE MY ITEMS?
  

  
* The system completely covers all vanilla game items but some items from "Whatever Mod" could be sorted differently depending... If something isn't placed from "Whatever Mod" where it should be:
    
  **(A)** It will be sent to the "Misc." Chest. The "Misc." Chest is also used for varying vanilla items EX. Lockpicks, Children's Clothing, etc... that fit the Misc. Category. Is also a drop-box incase items (after a sort) are defined as unidentified or unknown to the system.**(B)** It wont even sort to an arrayed Container and just remain in the Master Sorting Chest last placed prior to initializing a Sort.

* If a sort has started; let if finish before attempting to sort again. If its a huge amount of items; it may take some time. Let the sorting processes do their job. Upon testing; (QTY:875) items takes roughly 280 seconds to complete but that's on my crumby laptop. Its speed is also influenced by rig specifications.
**REMEMBER** this system is sorting an array of over 60 Containers where most Sort 10+ Containers. Multi-Threading theoretically is the only optional one-up steroid left to give this system new punch using alternative methodology but it was attempted and didn't work out for the better. Multi-task being productive in other ways while Papyrus processes; not a Debbie Downer Pylon. Thur Vonun don't need that.
  

  
ENHANCED FONT DISENCHANTER
  

  
* With use of functions supplied from SKSE; the Thur Vonun Font Disenchanter is rigged to operate IMHO, much more efficiently

  
UNDRESS/REDRESS BATHING

Two new undress/redress triggerbox actorzones will be added to Thur Vonun for all NPC's
  
[list]* One is in the Throne Living Area controlled by an ON/OFF wall button (DEF:OFF)
The other zone is inside of the children's hot-tub in the Thur Vonun Bunker which is always on

Due to Thur Vonun Sanctum [CORE] being an ESP-ESM; if conflict(s) arise from 3rd-party mods overriding Thur Vonun Tamriel NAVM (or any other Thur Vonun edited records); the Prime Overrides plugin carries all ESSENTIAL ITPO's forward to easily place anywhere in LO after confliction

**HOWEVER:** Any Patches provided for the Sanctum need to be loaded **higher in priority** or in other words; **after** the Optional Override Module

PERFORMANCE/KNOWN BUGSSpoilerPERFORMANCE
  
THUR VONUN IN ITS ENTIRETY
  

  
* AI NAVIGATION:
    
  [list]
Mod is fully Navmeshed with precision care. As a never-content NAVM extremist with very critical standards on myself; its as clean as a whistle (which is not common I say) with the exception it can always be better. I am always re-reviewing it regardless how many times I have already
  

[\*]ENGINE LIGHTING LIMITATIONS:
  

* This place is flicker-proof and I would be surprised if any flickering were to happen this including; all the togglable candles on at once and Player using a Torch with maybe a few micro-exceptions but none that I have seen.
[/list]THUR VONUN AREAS
  

  
* THUR VONUN GROTTOES - **Supreme**
    
  [list]
Not a performance demanding Cell to start with
  
* Native Engine feature [Occlusion Culling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden-surface_determination)﻿ with the use of plane markers have been strategically utilized in cell

[\*]THUR VONUN PASSAGE (TAMRIEL) - **Supreme**
  

* The Sabre-cats have a toll. They use **[Fluffworks (Fluffy Animals)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56361)﻿** Shelling and since the Shell-Rigging; I noticed right away a hit at Thur Vonun Passage. Quality Version was implemented at first but was too powerful. Medium Version is currently implemented and visually looks just as great IMHO (without such a hard hit on performance)

[\*]THUR VONUN SANCTUM - **Supreme**
  

* Large trigger-boxes are utilized around the Sanctum and depending where the player is Enables/Disables Lighting Sources and models that have looping Particle System Mechanics (unseen to the camera) to preserve PC resources. Only 10-15% overall Lighting/Models with Looping effects are active in the Sanctum at a time depending where the player is. Makes a tremendous difference
Native Engine feature Occlusion Culling with the use of plane markers have been strategically utilized in cell
  
* Performance "Model Swapping options" supplied in the FOMOD. This is something I thought up. Swap models of lighter segmentation (as loose-file placeholder) overwriting the default models in the Mods BSA which have heavier (but necessary) segmentation

[/list]KNOWN BUGS
  
ANYWHERE IMPLEMENTED (LOCATION(S))
  

  
* ROPE TRAVEL DEVICES SYSTEM:
    
  [list]
During the players travel using any rope device from point A to Point B exceeding 8 seconds or so trip duration; their is an odd jog combined with a landing sound which will then have that same glitch happen again 7/8 seconds after the first and so-on (if the duration of the travel is very long).
  
* Must be something to do with the Internal Animation Behavioral System. This is unresolved but its something you learn to ignore and accept.

[/list]THUR VONUN SANCTUM PASSAGE (LOCATION)
  

  
* SABRETOOTH CATS (ADULTS MAINLY):
    
  [list]
Sometimes they will randomly do a quirky spin followed right after with a chasing butterflies gallop. 
  
* Package at first (so I thought) banging my head trying absolutely everything I could think of that might be responsible failed to be. Took break and followed a Vanilla Cat by Free Cam. Surprisingly; they did it a few times.
Again; Internal Animation Behavioral bug of sorts.

TECHNICAL AID SECTIONSpoilerFOR: 3RD-PARTY MODS WITH THUR VONUN TIES 
  
[Hearthfire multiple adoptions - Now with custom home support for kids and spouse](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3862)
  

  
* THE 6TH ADOPTED KID SLEEPING IN BED ISSUE:
    
  [list]
Having tested Thur Vonun countless times over and over just getting married and adopting 6 kids (fresh game, fresh start), there is always a hit or miss chance where either the 6th kid will find their bed or they wont
  
* If they find there bed, this is great because they should consistently continue using that assigned bed
If they don't find their bed and just idle beside it, this will carry on for the remainder of your game
  
* Its a game coin toss whether the 6th kid will meet their assigned bed or not. This not only limited to Thur Vonun but I have seen it in many homes I have played; helped develop and others I fixed up in different ways. Its usually caused by the distance factor between the furniture markers they sleep on (tight space)

[\*]NOT TO WORRY AS THERE IS A FIX
  
[\*]Assuming after waiting an hour, two, three, a day, a week fixes nothing and they still remain idling when they should be in bed, lets move on then
  
[\*]Using [More Informative Console](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19250), select the troublesome BYOHAdoptedChild and enter these **T****WO** console commands stated below:
  

  
* **addfac 030183a8 0** and press enter <--- Hearthfires.esm **[03]** should occupy the 3rd mod index slot in your overall stack
**addfac 030042b0 0** and press enter <--- Hearthfires.esm **[03]** should occupy the 3rd mod index slot in your overall stack
  
* Now exit the console, exit the cell and re-enter the cell
Now this always corrects the kid for me and will be corrected persistently
  

[\*]STILL NOT WORKING? POSSIBLE REASONS COULD BE:
  

  
* 01. A mod making the kids unkillable
02. A mod conflict you will have to track down
  
* 03. I'm sure there are more but that's all I have at the moment

FAQ
  

* Q. Will this be ported to old Skyrim?
A. ~~No. Even if I managed to backport, the LE engine might not handle the Sanctum too well. This Sanctum really presses~~
  
[list]* EDIT. Upon successful backport, the game and Creation Kit completely freeze entering the Sanctum. For this mod, its out of the question

PERMISSIONS/LICENSESpoilerHERE'S THE DEAL
  
ASSET USE:
  

  
* For simplicity's sake; being this page handles so much permitted and prohibited assets that can/cannot be used by folk for their own creations to publish publicly; absolutely NOTHING can be re-located from this page. This is best way to safeguard the complete right(s) and best interest(s) of all parties
HOWEVER:
  
[list]* An extensive Modders Resource page [INXSIVE MA Resources Datadump](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61613)﻿ which houses tons of content from Thur Vonun
Making the resource page is best way to circumvent this promoting a simple CANNOT USE FROM HERE rule; but instead, head over there and KNOCK YOURSELVES OUT :-)
  

[/list]
  
PATCHES, EXPANSION & TRANSLATIONS:
  

  
* Welcome to be made from Community:
Expanding Thur Vonun in a way that could compromise areas in which I may have my personal plans for; best consult me
  
* I don't believe the creator would want to make something and then upon an update I make breaks your hard work due to no communication
Entirely fine to use Module Record Data pointing to Thur Vonun Package Asset(s) permitting Thur Vonun as Master but you may **NOT**:
  
[list]
  
* Re-package File Assets from Thur Vonun. This not only limited to **Patches, Expansion & Translations** but any other possible reasons included
If something needs to be altered for the sake of functionality; head over to [INXSIVE MA Resources Datadump](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61613)﻿ and hopefully it can be salvaged from there
