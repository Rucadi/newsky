- Author: michaeldovah
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

It is a small, simple tower, intended as a quick refuge between adventures. It has a few internal (alchemy lab, staff enchanter, arcane enchanter) and external (workbench, tanning rack, grindstone, and anvil) workstations. Three coffins, chests for safe storage, a ritual stone, and a shrine to the Daedric Prince Molag Bal. There is also an optional version with with two bretan servants.
  
  
**Note:** I use the amazing mod "*[Wintersun - Faiths of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506)*" to make Skyrim's religion more immersive. ***PATCH available in optional files***.
  
  
***About Molag Bal***
  
Molag Bal (Daedric: "Stone-Fire") is the God of Schemes and the Daedric Prince of domination and enslavement of mortals. He is also known by the titles King of Rape, King of Strife, Schemer Prince and Schemer Princess, Harvester of Souls, Father of Coldharbour and Lord of Lies. He is the creator of Vampires and Xivkyn as well. Molag Bal as the father of Vampirism is also recorded in the book called "Opusculus Lamae Bal ta Mezzamortie." The book tells a story of Molag Bal, who, in his hatred towards Arkay, profaned the body of a virgin Nedic woman, Lamae Beolfag. Lamae was killed by the ordeal, but rose from the dead as Lamae Bal, as well as the Blood Matron and the First Vampire.Pure-blooded vampires are those who were granted vampirism directly from Molag Bal, the creator and patron deity of Vampires. The process is somewhat similar to the creation of the first vampire, Lamae Beolfag—mortals gain their vampirism through a ritual in which members of a family pledge themselves to Molag Bal. Women who survive the horrific ordeal, such as Serana and her mother Valerica, are dubbed "Daughters of Coldharbour."

This mod *does not*add skin textures or hair to the game. Therefore, to make them look exactly as they do in the images, I recommend the following amazing mods:
  
  

  
* [Caliente's Beautiful Bodies Enhancer - CBBE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/198)﻿
﻿[BnP - Female Skin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65274)﻿﻿
  
* [The New Gentleman](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/104215)
[﻿BnP - Male Skin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65402)
  
* ﻿[High Poly Vanilla Hair](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41863)

﻿However, they will use the base game textures, so *they will be adapted for any body and texture skin mod you use*.

**Notes: a**nother mod that I recommend is *[Sweeping Organizes Stuff - Use Broom to Clean Mess](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51645)* in case you knock over some part of the decoration and want to clean the cell back to its original state (this mod saves me a lot). The follower shown in the images is *[Lucien](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20035)* ([reviewed by ljty7](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61263)) wearing the *[Traveling Mage HDT-SMP Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69394)*.
  
  
I'm a beginner in creating *house mods* so I apologize if any items don't work as expected, but I've done a lot of testing and everything seems to be fine. Please let me know if anything isn't working and I'll try to fix it. This is a really simple tower/house mod, nothing major, just letting you know :)
