* **INTRODUCTION**

I've always had a soft spot for the vanilla player homes, especially the ones in the major cities. There's something about them: the unique designs, the quests you need to do to get them (even tho *not* all of them are interesting, I must admit), the lives that your spouses and children can live in a walled city, your faithful and unwanted family addition - I mean, your housecarl... As I always do in my *never ending* modding journey, I strive to stay as close to the vanilla feeling as possible with the mods that I use, but unfortunately I never found a proper overhaul that really keeps things simple and lore-friendly. Don't get me wrong, there are some *awesome* options out there, and I got inspired by them, but unfotunately they didn't seem right for what I had in mind: one added a bath or extra beds, another used new assets or altered the original layout... *Not bad options*, just not was I was looking for, you know what I mean? So... I willingly decided to fall into the rabbit hole that is the Creation Kit, and I started to learn how to do things *my way*. This series aims to transform all vanilla player homes into something more, but still *vanilla*. Hopefully it will turn out great: I'm open to suggestions and technical advices, since that I'm still an *amateur* modder.
  
  
  

  
* **WHAT THIS MOD CHANGED AND ADDED**

Proudspire Manor is supposed to be the most beautiful and expensive player home that one can buy in the base game, with all the luxuries that one should expect in the capital of Skyrim. I tried to reflect that while staying as light as possible with the changes:
  
  
- Minor additions to the main hall and the secondary entrance in the basement.
  
- Dining areas with more decorations and food, with Hearthfire oven and butter churn added.
  
- Two weapon racks and a weapon and shield plaque added.
  
- Grindstone and workbench added in the basement.
  
- Minor changes to player and kids bedrooms.
  
- More refined and dignified housecarl room.
  
- Some minor external changes and decorations, nothing too fancy.
  
  
NOTE: *only two light bulbs added, no vanilla lighting changes, no navmeshes edited, all new objects that may get in the way are navcut (hopefully), file cleaned and flagged as ESL*, so it won't take a plugin spot. Let me know if something is wrong and I'll try to fix that!
  
  
ANOTHER NOTE: if you want to make a patch for this mod, feel free to share it, but I'm too lazy to make them.
  
  
  

  
* **REQUIREMENTS AND NOTES**

None, but there is a *BIG NOTE*: the changes were done in the CK *without* taking in consideration the buy-upgrades-from-steward system, since it was too much of a pain to even consider to deal with scripts. That means that if you haven't fully upgraded the house before entering it, you might find floating furniture. So it is *strongly* - and I mean it, *strongly* - recommended that you buy all upgrades - including child bedroom - before ever setting foot on your house for the first time. Adding this mod in an already existing save with all upgrades should be safe, but I woudn't recommend it either. Oh, and the mod was built while keeping in consideration USSEP and CC Fishing tweaks, but doesn't require them and *shouldn't* need patches.
  
  
  

  
* **RECOMMENDATIONS**

If you're looking for something more while still keeping things fairly simple, try the wonderful [Vanilla Player Homes Revamped](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/118675), which heavily inspired this series; if you want even more, the immortal [TNF Skyrim House Remodel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39333) is your choice.

And of course, thanks to the authors of the recommended mods, for giving inspiration.
