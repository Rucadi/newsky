Kintama Castle is a large stately home in the The Reach, left frozen in time by its Guardian Spirits long after its Tscaesi masters have long since vacated the land. The spirits that guard the estate await a rightful challenger to come forth and slay the Guardian so they may return to service, under a new Master.
  
  
It was during the period of the Akaviri Potentate was at the height of its power the estate was built - perhaps by a forlorn Tscaesi whom dearly missed home, or perhaps by a local Nord, intrigued by the Akaviri architecture brought over from Akavir; the particulars have been lost to time. It is unknown how the Estate came to be vacated, however it remains the fact the only occupants remaining are Guardian Spirits bound to the site to eternally watch over.

- Description -
  
  
This section will describe the overall property and its contents.
  
  
The property is overlooked by 3 ghostly guards who eternally are scheduled to follow their stations, and the keys to the gate are guarded by a wispmother found outside the property. Within the grounds at the front of the property is the primary courtyard that connects to the main building, the barracks and to the gardens.
  
  
The Gardens are sequestered into their own section with two locations for relaxation and for taking in the mountainous of The Reach and a variety of different fauna not found in Skyrim. The Barracks contain very little - primarily serving a decorative function for where the guards may have once lived or other living residents of the time. The main building has two primary entrances within the front coutyard.
  
  
The main building, which houses a entry hall which would serve as a place for function for greeting guests, as a hearing hall and throne room. It connects directly to the armourie room near the back of the room. Going left through the sliding doors you will find to the left, the dining hall and kitchen, to the right a small room for a shrine; and lastly straight ahead will be the staircases leading to the second floor. 
  
  
Upon entry to the second floor will be a door to the left and entry to the right, one leading to the courtyard and hotsprings located behind the Castle and the other will lead to the communal living space for residents; further through here are 3 separate player bedrooms, an indoor training room and the staircase outside to the player bedroom; which is part of the exterior worldspace.
  
  
The back-end of the Castle contains a courtyard for training, with several targets and dummies, and connects to the properties hotsprings. Not much else back there.
