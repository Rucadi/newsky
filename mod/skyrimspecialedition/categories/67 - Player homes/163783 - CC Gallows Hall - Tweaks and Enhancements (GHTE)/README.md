**Description**
  
  
This mod is part of my Tweaks and Enhancements series for Creation Club houses.
  
  
It bothered me that [Gallows Hall](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Gallows_Hall) was too easily obtainable. I made it harder to obtain and to build up. But if you manage to do so, the rewards will be far better.
  
  
**Changes**
  
  

  
* You can no longer freely enter. You'll need to persuade and pay [Wuunferth the Unliving](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Wuunferth_the_Unliving)﻿ to gain entry.
The puzzle (aka escape room quest) is a little bit more cryptic.
  
* The artifacts have been nerfed, so their initial strength is much lower. However, there are options to improve them to become much stronger.
Many free high-level items have been removed. (Black Souls etc)
  
* All crafting stations, except the arcane enchanter, altar of the revenant and Bone Forge have been removed and need to be crafted at the workbench. The Bone Forge also requires repair at the carpenter's workbench.
Added new things to craft: Solstheim staff enchanter, fish tanks ([CC fishing](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Fishing)﻿ patch), staff and scroll enchanters ([Sorcerer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/95196)﻿ patch) and even a portal to the Soul Cairn.
  
* Renamed the artifacts to "Replica of" and "Replicated" versions, to avoid narrative conflict with other mods that add them. Also changed the effects of some of them.
Made the Bone Forge into a crafting station and added more undead creatures to permanently summon, giving you have learned the corresponding spell. You can also upgrade the Staff of Worms there.
  
* Added synergy with other necromancy mods.
Fixed some bugs.
  

  
**Gaining Entry**
  
  
Once you arrive at Gallows Hall, you'll notice the door barricaded and locked. You'll find a note that has you speak to Wuunferth the Unliving. For compatibility reasons, for the dialogue to trigger you need to have either completed [Blood on the Ice](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Blood_on_the_Ice) completely, or haven't started it yet. Wuunferth also can't be in the Bloodworks.
  
  
Wuunferth will need to be persuaded to let you buy a warrant and the key to enter. This can be done through the following means:
  
  
Spoiler

  
* Wearing an amulet of Stendarr -> Saying you're with the Vigil. (hard speech check: level 75 in speech)
Completing Blood on the Ice, and showing Calixto's note (\*) -> Saying you'd want to prevent future murderers like him (average speech check: level 50 in speech)
  
* Completing the College of Winterhold and becoming Archmage -> Saying it's for academic means. (easy speech check: level 25 in speech)
Becoming a Thane of Eastmarch -> Informing him you're a Thane of Eastmarch (easy speech check: level 25 in speech)
  
* Lastly, I added an additional line in which you tell him you're a necromancer. He won't like this though, and it will have severe consequences. Be warned!

  
  
(\*) This note is my attempt to integrate Gallows Hall with the various necromancers across Skyrim.
  
  
  
Once you have persuaded him, he'll sell you a warrant and the key for 7500 gold. (The price is customizable through console commands.)
  
  
**The Escape Room**
  
  
With key in hand, you can now enter Gallows Hall. The escape room quest is mostly unchanged, although I did change certain descriptions in the notes to make it a bit more cryptic.
  
  
Once you have solved it, the home is yours. A carpenter's workbench will be available outside, at which you can craft various objects, Hearthfire-style.

The following objects are craftable at the carpenter's workbench:

(\*4) Requires Necro patch -> CC Necromantic Grimoire.
  
(\*5) Requires patch for [Undeath](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6180).
  
  
  
**Artifacts**
  
  
I've renamed the artifacts to avoid any narrative conflict with other mods that add them:
  
  

  
* Staff of Worms -> <Tier Name> Replica of Staff of Worms
Bloodworm Helm -> Replicated Bloodworm Helm
  
* Helm of Oreyn Bearclaw -> Helm of Oreyn Bearclaw

  
The [Staff of Worms](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Staff_of_Worms) comes in the following tiers:
  
  
Spoiler

  
* Faded Replica of Staff of Worms: Deals 10 points of shock damage to living targets. Reanimate a dead body, up to level 10, to fight for you for 15 seconds.
Lesser Replica of Staff of Worms: Deals 25 points of shock damage to living targets. Reanimate a dead body, up to level 15, to fight for you for 60 seconds. If target dies within 30 seconds, fills a soul gem.
  
* Imperfect Replica of Staff of Worms: Deals 50 points of shock damage to living targets. Reanimate a dead body, up to level 20, to fight for you for 300 seconds. If target dies within 60 seconds, fills a soul gem. If target dies within 20 seconds, it is raised as undead.

If target dies within 90 seconds, fills a soul gem. Absorb 45 points of Stamina. If target dies within 50 seconds, it is raised as undead. - 50
  
* Ascendant Replica of Staff of Worms: Deals 100 points of shock damage to living targets. Reanimate a dead body, up to level 50, to fight for you. If target dies within 150 seconds, fills a soul gem. Absorb 95 points of Magicka. Absorb 95 points of Stamina. If target dies within 200 seconds, it is raised as undead.
  
  
The helms have had the following edits:
  
  
Spoiler
  
[Bloodworm Helm](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Bloodworm_Helm) enchantment was changed to:
  
Conjuration spells cost 25% less to cast. If wearer is undead, they deal 50% more attack (melee) damage.
  
  
[Helm of Oreyn Bearclaw](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Helm_of_Oreyn_Bearclaw): no changes to its enchantment:
  
Stamina regenerates 20% faster. Increases your stamina by 70 points.
  
  
  
**Additional Changes**
  
  
I fixed a bug where you could be kidnapped by the Dark Brotherhood, after completing [Innocence Lost](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Innocence_Lost) while using the bed to sleep for Vaermina's part of the Dreams of the Dead quest, breaking that quest. (thanks to Vicn, for [Dark Brotherhood Kidnapping - Restricted](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/163344), which I used as a base to exclude Gallows Hall as a location.)
  
  
I've moved around a lot of objects, to make room for new craftables.
  
  
I've removed many high-level items that were just lying around fro free.
  
  
I've added a new section beneath the Bone Forge, which I dubbed the "Ritual chamber". In this chamber, I placed a door to the portal for the Soul Cairn, in addition to spots for the crafting stations of Undeath. I might eventually add some more stuff here.
  
  
**Customization**
  
  
You can use console commands to edit the following:
  
  
**Amount of gold to pay Wuunferth**
  
  

```
set GHTE_GLOB_GallowHallPrice to X
```

  
X is the amount to pay Wuunferth to get the key and the warrant. (7500 is the default value.) Keep in mind that the dialogue text might not properly update, but the real value will be.
  
  
**Requirements**
  
  

  
* [CC Gallows Hall](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Gallows_Hall)
[po3 Papyrus Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22854)
  

  
**Compatibility**
  
  
I've made patches for:
  
  

  
* **GHTE - Survival Made Patch**: [CC Survival Mode](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Survival_Mode) (standalone, main file of GHTE is not needed). -> Includes a small bugfix for the shrine of Vaermina not being properly taken into account for Survival Mode.
**GHTE - CC Fishing Patch**: [CC Fishing](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Fishing). -> Adds craftable fish tanks.
  
* **GHTE - CC Necro Patch**: [CC Necromantic Grimoire](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Necromantic_Grimoire) + [CC Plague of the Dead](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Plague_of_the_Dead) -> Adds the summonable creatures as options to the Bone Forge.
**GHTE - Lorkhan's Legacy Patch**: [Lorkhan's Legacy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54737) -> Makes the altar of the revenant consistent with the altars in Lorkhan's Legacy. You need to cast Soul Trap (or scroll or staff) on the altar instead, to convert soul gems. Outside of the "Dreams of the Dead" quest, the Shade of the Revenant needs to be present for it to work. Also adds a copy of the Necromancer Moon book to Gallows Hall.
  
* **GHTE - Sorcerer Patch**: [Sorcerer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/95196) (\*1) -> Replaces the Solstheim Staff Enchanter with the one from Sorcerer (also removes the Reluctant Steward quest requirement) In addition, adds a craftable Scroll Enchanter.
**GHTE - Wintersun Patch**: [Wintersun](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506) (standalone, main file of GHTE is not needed) -> Adds Wintersun functionality to the shrine of Vaermina. Also replaces the Wintersun mesh for the shrines of Vaermina with the mesh from Gallows Hall.
  
* **GHTE - Undeath Patch**: [Undeath](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6180) -> Replaces generic banners in Gallows Hall with banners from Undeath. Adds craftable Dark Pact Blood Bowl and Necromantic Altar. Adds Wisp Mother to Bone Forge as summonable creature. Changes the recipes for improving the Staff of Worms. Replaces the mesh of Undeath's Staff of Worms with the Staff of Worms mesh from Gallows Hall.
**GHTE - Homes Under the Warhammer Patch**: [Homes Under the Warhammer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67444) -> Makes edits to the Dreams of the Dead quest, which I merged with my edits in this patch.
  
* **GHTE - REA Patch**: [Rebalancing Anniversary Edition - Quest Requirements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61004) -> Disabled the door and re-enabled them a player reached a certain level. In my patch, I reverted this edits intentionally, but I applied the level restriction to Wuunferth's dialogue instead. As such, the level restriction set in its MCM stays intact, but is applied differently.
**GHTE - RoM Patch**: [Reliquary of Myth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31612)﻿ has an optional patch for Gallows Hall, within its FOMOD, called "*RoM - Gallows Hall Patch.esp*". My patch (GHTE - RoM Patch.esp) patches this patch (RoM - Gallows Hall Patch.esp) with GHTE. I forwarded my effects and upgrades for the Staff of Worms, and forwarded the effects from RoM for the two helms.
  

  
(\*1) When using both Lorkhan's Legacy and Sorcerer Patches, make sure the main ESP of Lorkhan's Legacy (More Lore-Friendly Soulgems.esp) is loaded AFTER Sorcerer.esp, otherwise you won't be able to use the Soul Trap spell/scroll/staff on the altar.
  
  
Other mods for Gallows Hall:
  
  

  
* [Better CC NecroHouse (Gallows Hall)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/163595) -> A lightweight alternative if you only want some additional requirements to getting Gallows Hall. Don't use together with GHTE as they'll conflict.
[Unofficial Skyrim Creation Club Content Patches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18975) -> Load GHTE AFTER all of these!
  
* [Creation Club - Gallows Hall - Daedric Shrines Vaermina](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71202) -> Mesh replacer. Compatible with GHTE.

* [Gallows Hall - Planters](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59800) -> Adds planters. The planters will be inconsistent as they will be present from the start, instead of being craftables. Might also have floating, clipping objects when used with GHTE.

* [Dark Brotherhood Kidnapping - Restricted](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/163344) -> already implemented in my mod + an additional exclusion for Gallows Hall. (see above) You can let GHTE override this one.
[Wintersun - Anniversary Edition Patches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58988)﻿ -> GHTE - Wintersun Patch already does this + more.
  

  
**FAQ**
  
  
Q: This mod doesn't work.
  
A: That comment doesn't work either.
  
  
Q: The lower end of the Gallows Hall is invisible. Only when I get close it appears.
  
A: You have another conflicting mod reverting my edits to the lower roombounds. Check in xEdit for conflicts and load my mod after the conflicting one.
  
  
Q: Will you add more (craftable) crafting stations and things like planters?
  
A: Probably not. Not every home needs to have every possible crafting station. However, if there are mods that add very specific crafting stations related to necromancy, I might consider it.
  
  
Q: ESPFE?
  
A: Yes.
  
  
Q: Does installing/updating/uninstalling on an existing save work?
  
A: As far as I know, it should. However, it's good practice to keep a backup save prior to doing this, just in case.
  
  
Q: Is this compatible with <insert mod>?
  
A: I don't know by heart. You might need to check yourself.
  
  
Q: Will you make a patch for <insert mod>?
  
A: Only if it's a mod I use myself or plan on using it, I have enough time and I actually like the idea. Otherwise, feel free to do it yourself. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: I have a suggestion to improve the mod. Can you do it?
  
A: Maybe, if I have time and I like the idea, I'll consider it.
  
  
Q: Will you port this to <insert platform>?
  
A: No, I myself only support the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If someone else wants to port it, feel free. (see permission) If you decide to port it, you yourself take full responsibility to offer support to said port. I will not provide no support for any ports by third parties.
  
  
Q: I use a ported version of this mod on <insert platform> and I have a problem. Can you help?
  
A: I don't provide any support for third party ports on other platforms than the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If you have issues, you should adress the person that ported it.
