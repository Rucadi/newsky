**Order of Aetherius - Scholar's Village**
  
  
Established by mages fleeing the dissolution of the Mages Guild nearly 150 years ago, the **[Order of Aetherius](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/135750)** provides a safe place to study magic and preserve knowledge. It is the only **School of Julianos**in Skyrim, though there many to be found elsewhere across Tamriel. As they are affiliated with the Temple of the Divines, the Order of Aetherius is steadfastly opposed to necromancy and the darker magical arts. They are a smaller order that does not seek much political or magical power, but rather seeks to do good works, provide help to those in need, and support the charitable mission of the Temple of the Divines.
  
  
The **Skyrim Chapter Hall**, located in a remote mountain pass between Whiterun and Ivarstead, has recently completed three new buildings that make it properly equipped for visiting scholars. They offer free beds for travelers in the **Scholar's Lodge**, and have two **cabin homes** available for longer stays.
  
  
Why a new mod page you may ask? Fundamentally the goals and design of this location add-on are completely different than the **[Order of Aetherius](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/135750)** that it requires. The **Order of Aetherius** mod is designed as a new guild location, with new NPCs/Followers, vendors, and miscellaneous quests, with a room dedicated to the player similarly to your quarters in any other Skyrim Guild Hall. The **Scholar's Village** adds two new empty houses and a traveler's lodge, intended for you to put followers or yourself in them - designed as a player home rather than a guild/quest location. Some folks will prefer the first, but not the second, so I split this mod out as its own addition in the appropriate "Player Homes" mod category on Nexus. Plus, splitting it let me keep them both **ESL Flagged**, which I'm sure folks appreciate.
  
  
This mod**HAS/IS**:
  

  
* A place for you and some followers to live - adding space for up to 7 additional people. Use a mod like [My Home Is Your Home](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7096)﻿, [Nether's Follower Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55653)﻿, or [Settling of Squad](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/125471) ﻿to move them in - or alternately take a look at what I did in the Fiarrah and Inalion addons and do the same for an npc / follower of your choice (note the package additions as well).
A player home with custom storage and activators that blends in seamlessly to the Order of Aetherius Mystic Refuge location.
  
* Lore-friendly, without custom content that will seem obviously different in tone than everything else in Skyrim.
Alternate Perspective start enabled - addon found in the required Order of Aetherius mod.
  
* A home for [Fiarrah](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/83483)﻿﻿, a scholar and healer of some repute - addon found in Optional Files.
A home for [Inalion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/82884)﻿, a Monk of the Eight Fists - addon found in Optional Files.
  
* An innkeeper - **Verash gra-Ulgarn** - She will use your default texture paths and body shapes. Though not pictured as having the protruding orc brows in my game - if you have your game set up for that, she'll have them.

  
This mod **IS NOT**: 

  
* A mannequin or weapon rack warehouse.
A display museum. The Order of Aetherius is not in the business of hoarding magical artifacts - they suggest you consider establishing a museum in Solitude for that ([Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802)﻿).
  
* Adoption or child enabled.

  
This mod REQUIRES:

  
* [Backported Extended ESL Support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441)﻿ IF you are on a version of Skyrim earlier than 1130.

**FAQ**:
  
  

  
* You will need some sort of CBBE/3BA or UNP/BHUNP setup for the gals in the mod this requires OR choose specific armors for the gals that are CBBE or UNP appropriately, and give them to only the five ladies of Order of Aetherius.
**Scholar's Village** is **ESL Flagged** so is a Light Plugin and will not take a spot in your load order.
  
* It was created with the .1170 version of the Creation Kit thus has a 1.71 header.
As it uses the extended ESL range of FormIDs, it absolutely requires [Backported Extended ESL Support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441) for versions of Skyrim pre-1130.
  
* Compatibility with [Lux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43158)﻿ and [Lux Orbis](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56095)﻿ is provided in the Optional Files.
As this is an ESP flagged Light that adds new cells, any patches that edit the cell details should use the Partial Form flag to avoid potential issues. If you're looking at tinkering with image space or lighting, note that I put those into the roombounds, and they should be edited there rather than the cell record.
  
* Why is the download comparatively small? Assets are in the required Order of Aetherius file, so I did not need to add many new ones.
If the NPCs in your game are bald, that likely means you are using Racial Skin Variance (RSV) or the Nolvus mod list, both of which are notorious for this issue. Consult instructions in that mod / mod list for how to resolve the issue by excluding NPCs.
  
* If you'd like to swing by the [Modharbour Discord](https://discord.gg/ewU53g3r)﻿ for more support, you are quite welcome to.

  
  
**Compatibility**:
  
  

  
* **Compatible** with [High Tavern](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/121358)﻿ using the provided patch.
**Compatible**with [Forgotten Dungeons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/449)﻿ using the provided patch. Also requires the [patch that moves the Forgotten Tower](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/134497)﻿ that would otherwise conflict. This patch is listed as a "High Tavern / Forgotten Dungeons" patch but it works perfectly with Order of Aetherius as well.
  
* **Compatible**with the [Forgotten Dungeons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/449)﻿ + [High Tavern](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/121358)﻿ combination using the provided patch. Also requires the [patch that moves the Forgotten Tower](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/134497)﻿ that would otherwise conflict.
Currently **Incompatible** with [Ancient Falmer Ruins](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/126428)﻿, which adds a huge Falmer wall/temple/ruin at the same location.
  

  
Thanks to [JPSteel2﻿](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/JPSteel2) for the Cities of the North assets, [Oaristys](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Oaristys)﻿ for the excellent resource packs, [SDlutz](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/SDlutz)﻿ for the Vanilla Table Replacer meshes/textures, and [SothaSimp](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/sothasimp)﻿ for the wonderful beds, chairs, and benches.
  
  
Much appreciation to [JoShady75](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/joshady75), without whom this mod would not exist and who was a co-author of the Order of Aetherius that this mod required (and designer of its five followers).
