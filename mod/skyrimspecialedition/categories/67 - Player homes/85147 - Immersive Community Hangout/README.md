**Big, Glorius Manor Built After Community Legends**
  
  
We wanted to immortalise our community and good times we had with our community members with this small mod we have created.
  
This is the server we have tried to immortalise: [Immersive Collections Community Discord Server - 22.500 Members](https://discord.gg/immersive-collections)For those who do not know, this server is the biggest server for collections out there and was originally built for [Immersive & Adult](https://next.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/collections/xxsqm4) and [Immersive & Pure](https://next.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/collections/qfftpq), now serving as a hub for even more mods and collections out there.
  
  
  
  
This mod does not only include some memories and easter eggs, it is also a really cool player house you can use with many many features.
  
  
  
**Main Features**- Located between Solitude and Dragon bridge, on a nice hill that has an excellent view.
  
- Fully functioning Elevator
  
- Fully functional player house with lots of storage area
  
- Jakuzi / pool
  
- Dungeon
  
- Lots of easter eggs about our community.
  
  
Let's see these features in detail:
  
  

**Main Floor:**

  
  
  
Glorious Entrance, Jakuzi, Kitchen, Bar / Tavern, Museum of bugs, Museum of legends
  
  
**Entrance Area**
  
Glorius Entrance area - Museum of legends to the left and museum of bugs to the right (written after the bugs and problems we had to deal with on Immersive series of collections)
  
Behind the stairs, there is a fully functional elevator that you can take to go to the dungeon and there is a tavern area.
  
This entrance area will have a welcoming NPC standing around here.
  
  
  
Note: The statue is a sexy variant of a default statue in the base game. You will see whatever version of the statue you have on your end.
