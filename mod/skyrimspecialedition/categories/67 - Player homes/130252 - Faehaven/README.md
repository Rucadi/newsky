# Faehaven
- Author: Furiant
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/130252


The Eldergleam has seeded many children over the millenia, known by many names. One such tree, *Faeweldyn*, is tended by a little village called Faehaven, deep in the Reach. At the center of the village is a spring of sacred water that nourishes the tree. It is the duty of the Springkeeper to keep this water clean and blessed. Your service to the Gildergreen shows that you are worthy of this role and the home it provides.
  
  
Requires: 1.5.97+ and the official DLCs (HearthFires, Dawnguard, Dragonborn).

**This quest is started automatically after completing *The Blessings of Nature* for Danica Pure-Spring in Whiterun.** **A new save is recommended.** SpoilerThe quest initialization is handled by the Story Manager, which can be a little finicky. I've tried to set things up such that it will start the quest on an existing save. I have successfully started it with existing saves, but YMMV.
  
  
**Features**
  

  
* A modest and cozy Telvanni-style player home with room for a spouse, and up to four children (via [Hearthfire Multiple Adoptions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3862)﻿). Includes an artifact display space, cooking/baking, a functional butter churn, and more.
Short, easy quest to become a resident of the village and gain access to the player home and all village features
  
* Repeating quest to perform your duties as Springkeeper. By default this is on a weekly cycle. You can also disable it entirely.
Beneath the house is the Spring Heart. Serves as a bathhouse for mods like [Keep It Clean](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17846)﻿.
  
* Separate guest quarters with room for two companions, using something like [MHIYH](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20227?tab=files)﻿ or [NFF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55653)﻿
Full crafting facilities outside. Crafting storage is linked, separated into Alchemy, Cooking, Enchanting, and Smithing for convenience (esp. with mods like [Linked Crafting Storage](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64772)﻿).
  
* Village residents are vendors. Your relationship with them improves over time.
    
  [list]
Drevani, the Blacksmith
  
* Liria, the Priest (magic goods)
Haunts the Moors, the Stablekeep (misc)
  
* Sewynn, the Agrarian (food, ingredients, misc)

[\*]Custom Soul Gem Transmuter (upgrades soul gems) governed by your Conjuration skill
  
[\*]Custom Incense system (craftable incenses that grant temporary buffs on a cooldown)
  
[\*]Garden with 13 plots
  
[\*]Functional grainery
  
[\*]Fish hatchery﻿
  
[\*]Travel spell that teleports you to Faehaven, and leaves behind a field portal you can recall to
  
[\*]Carriage service to (not from) all major stops
  
[\*]Configuration system
  
[/list]
  
**Notes**
  

  
* To start the quest normally, you must first complete *The Blessings of Nature* for Danica in Whiterun.
Many features are unavailable until you complete the Faehaven quest (which is very short and easy). SpoilerIf you want to skip everything (including the requirement to complete Blessings of Nature), CoC to FuriFHExtCenter and find the button in the cabinet under Sewynn's market stall near the tree. This will complete the quest and unlock everything.
  
* The residents have left gift baskets for the new Springkeeper in your home; you should gather these and read the notes (Sewynn's and Haunts the Moors' in particular).
Many features are configurable using the Book of Preferences on the desk in the player home.[list]
  
* Springkeeper Duty: Reward (Gold, Ingredients, or a random Skill Point), and Cycle (how often the quest repeats). If you set the cycle to disabled while you have the Springstep perk active, you'll keep the buff permanently (assuming perks are enabled).
Incense: Enable/disable, cooldown duration. If disabled, Springkeeper Duty will no longer give incense ingredients in addition to its reward.
  
* Travel Spell: Enable/disable, Lesser Power or Shout
Child beds: 2 or 4
  
* Carriage Service: Enable/disable
Soul Gem Transmuter: Enable/disable
  
* Perks: Enable/disable

  
  
[\*]Read the note near the portstone at the crafting area to learn the travel spell (see screenshot)
  
[\*]There's nothing beyond the shimmering boundary. It just constrains the viewable area such that I don't have to generate complex LODs. The little pod houses are supposed to be where the villagers live. (In truth they all live in a dark basement crammed with furniture and dirty naked farmers.)
  
[\*]Most clutter is either static, or locked down but lootable. Most lootable stuff is set to not respawn.
  
[\*]Linked storage is categorized, but the containers have no actual type restrictions.
  
[\*]All storage should be safe, except obviously respawning things like the Apiary. Actually that's the only thing I can think of that isn't.
  
[\*]The animals in the stable are set not to respawn. 
  
[\*]The horse is for flavor. If you ride it, it will become your active mount, and you should see it in Skyrim when you exit. When you come back to Faehaven it should be in its stall again. You cannot ride it into/out of the worldspace, though. Best I can do.
  
[\*]Lore: similar to how the temple in Whiterun serves Kynareth, the residents of Faehaven perform their duties to Faeweldyn in the name of
  
Mara. Each villager however chooses their own personal diety/ies. You'll find shrines to all the divines around the area.[/list]
  
**Known Issues**

  
* Villagers that offer favor jobs (chop wood, gather ore) have voices compatible with these jobs, but don't speak the lines for some reason. Possible that some of them are not even actually functioning. I'll keep looking at this.
The three unlabeled door icons on the exterior local map are NPC doors; it seems to be impossible to hide them.
  
* The Preferences book occasionally ignores a click on a main menu option (ex: you click 'Misc', and it just closes the menu). The options work, just try again.
﻿Grass replacers that alter \*NoGrass variants to... have grass... tend to make paths shrink or disappear, and grass to spawn in unintended places. I can only do so much to mitigate it.
  
* Geometry replacers that make assets double or triple their original size are going to make a mess of things (ex: the Repairing the Phial display). Same with changing the origin position/rotation (ex: the Solstheim Dragon Priest masks). Or straight up deleting assets like glow fills or plants they don't like. I don't bother trying to mitigate this. If it looks off, or floating, or missing, then another mod broke it.
Texture replacers that make everything washed out dirty concrete and abandon the unique aesthetic of the originals (e.g.: dwemer stone and metal, redoran shell) tend to produce terrible results in my mods. I'm not a vanilla purist, but I'll take a low-res thematic texture designed by an artist over a high-res generic version with no details, bad UV mapping, and no regard for color theory, done by an algorithm. But you do you.
  

  
**Possible Future Stuff**
  

  
* Make incense AoE so it affects followers. This would be trivial in Fallout, but I haven't found an approach I consider both reliable and performant in Skyrim.
Squeeze an additional follower bed into the Guest Quarters. Would probably require scaling up the entire interior. Too many moving parts to make a kids-or-followers system in the main home.
  
* Delay the invitation letter from Danica for a day or two at least. I go back and forth on this; I tend to favor not having to wait, over the realism aspect.
Convenient Horses compatibility. Currently no information on this.
  
* Fix up the vendor side job issue

  
**Probably Won't Implement**
  

  
* Villagers as followers, just doesn't make sense
Carriage service to the worldspace
  
* Kids-or-Followers area upstairs in player home
6 kids, or 6 followers. The home is meant to be somewhat humble. Also, the telvanni interior architecture is very limiting and hard to lay out that many believable personal spaces.
