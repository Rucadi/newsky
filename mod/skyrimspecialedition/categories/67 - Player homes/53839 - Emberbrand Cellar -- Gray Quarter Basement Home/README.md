**Description**
  
 ﻿This is a small one-and-a-halfish room basement home with a unique layout located in Windhelm's Gray Quarter. It's not specifically Dunmer themed but uses a mix of common and Dunmer furniture-- kind of like whoever furnished the place was using whatever was available in the GQ. There is a lot of storage space (some of it uniquely named) and most shelves can be used as semi-labeled storage (e.g potions, soul gems, tools, etc). The stew pot and cooking plate thing next to the fire can be used for normal food crafting/hearthfire baking, respectively. There's an alembic on the kitchen counter thing that can be used for alchemy and a book on the desk in the lower area that can be used for enchanting. If you have Capital Windhelm Expansion theres a suite of blacksmithing tools just up the ladder outside the entrance of the house. I made everything inside a static object, so no need to worry about getting stacked at the start of the game/knocking everything over when you walk in. There's also a secret storage area (see screenshots) on the lower landing of the stairs opened by pressing the stone button to the left of the thin table (you'll see it)
  
  
**Inspiration**
  
 The bed was inspired (read: almost a 1:1 replication) of the bed in Graystone Lodge from Surjamte's Capital Windhelm Expansion (which you should have installed)
  
 ﻿The layout was loosely inspired by [Marco's basement from Better Call Saul](https://i.imgur.com/ZAG20c4.png):
  
  
**Installation**
  
 ﻿Just install with a mod manager or drag and drop the unpacked zip into your data folder, put it early in your load order
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
 ﻿Should be compatible with most city overhauls (Capital Windhelm, JKs, Dawn of, etc) but there might be stuff clipping through/in front of the entry door with the latter two-- I haven't tested with them. Either way Capital Windhelm should 100% be in your load order and this house works with it so hey, its compatible lol
  
  
**Known Issues**
  
-Followers don't really like the stairs very much
  
-the doors do that funny thing where they clip into the wall a little when you open them.. please ignore it lol
