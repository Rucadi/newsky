**Description**
  
  
Just like I did with [Farming](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69029) and [Myrwatch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97659/), I dedided to do the same for [CC Hendraheim](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Hendraheim_(place)).
  
  
This mod changes the following things about [CC Hendraheim](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Hendraheim_(place)):
  
  

  
* Removed Alchemy Lab and Arcane Enchanter.
Removed named displays for unique items (like dragon priest masks, paragons, Daedric artifacts, etc) in the cellar.
  
* Repurposed the cellar into a ~~dormitory for followers.~~ rooms for servants (which can be hired at the steward.)
Removed several high level items, that were otherwise too easy to get.
  
* Repurposed the master bedroom, so both sides of the master bed are accessible.
Buffed [Eydvina Shield-Hearth](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Eydvina_Shield-Hearth).
  
* Replaced some generic dialogue lines of [Eydvina Shield-Hearth](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Eydvina_Shield-Hearth) with some custom spliced ones that hopefully fit a little better.
After having defeated [Eydvina Shield-Hearth](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Eydvina_Shield-Hearth), you'll need to loot the proof of worth of her body. This will direct you to go to steward of Markarth to buy the home for 25000 septims. (configurable price) The steward is either [Raerek](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Raerek) ﻿or [Reburrus Quintilius](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Reburrus_Quintilius)﻿, depending on which faction controls Markarth.
  
* Havok disabled all clutter. (If you use [my other mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93426), all stuff should stay in place, while still being lootable.)
Added a carpenters workbench when Hendraheim is bought. At it, you can craft certain things. (see below)
  
* Added option to hire a steward. At them, you can buy/hire certain persons and creatures. (see below)
Added steps to create a path from the road leading up to Hendraheim
  
* Created a proper chimney for the fireplace. (no more carbon monoxide poisoning!)
Added an entirely new area -> 2nd and 3rd floor, which functions as a dormitory for followers and allows up to 15 dismissed followers to stay. They will sleep, sandbox and train there. They will also protect you if you, the animals, servants or carriage driver gets attacked outside.
  
* Added option to assign Hendraheim as a new home for dismissed followers (up to 15).

  
  
At the Carpentry workbench, you can make:
  
Spoiler

  
* Forge
Grindstone
  
* Tanning Rack
Smelter
  
* Workbench
Alchemy lab
  
* Arcane Enchanter
Oven
  
* Churn
Apiaries (beehouses)
  
* Animal pen
Garden (12 planters)
  
* Fish Tank (Patch for CC Fishing. Requires [Catch of the Day](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Catch_of_the_Day) to be completed)
  
  
At the steward, you can hire/buy:
  
Spoiler

  
* Bard
Farm animals (1 cow, 2 goats, 3 chickens)
  
* Horse
Carriage with driver that takes you to many important locations
  
* Servants (4 in total, 1 alchemy trainer and one innkeeper) -> they will stay in their rooms in the cellar.
  
  
When you can bring a follower to Hendraheim, you can tell them that this is their new home. When dismissed, they will now stay at Hendraheim.
  
If there's enough demand, I might use SPID to apply this to followers from mods as well.
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
  
I added patches for:
  
  

  
* [CC Fishing](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Fishing)﻿
[Rebalancing Anniversary Edition - Quest Requirements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61004)
  
* [Homes Under the Warhammer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67444/)
~~[Unofficial Skyrim Creation Club Content Patches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18975)~~ -> no longer supported, just load my plugin after this.
  
* [Eydvina Shield-Hearth Boss Fight](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/113981)

  
Incompatible mods:
  
  

  
* [Hendraheim - Planters](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30806) -> Will clip with my edits. (smelter and garden)
[Skyrim Hendraheim Road](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70806) -> Navmeshes and landscape edits will conflict.
  
* [More Hendraheim Beds](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81283) -> Will clip with new idle markers I placed around the hall.
[Hendraheim Hall Stability](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97441) -> will conflict with my edits.
  
* [Hendraheim Renovated](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/88978) -> Will conflict with my edits.
[Hendraheim (CrystalTower15's Edition)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/113652) -> Will heavily conflict.
  

  
Other mods:
  
  

  
* [Hendraheim - Creation Club Patches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30517) -> as long as you load those **before** my mod, they are compatible.

  
**Customization**
  
  
The default price of Hendraheim is 25,000 septims, but you can change this price by using a console command:
  
  
Spoiler
  

```
set cceejsse004_HousePrice to X
```

  
  
Whereas X is the amount of gold. (Default value is 25,000.) Keep in mind that if you edit this midgame that the value may not be correctly displayed in dialogue, but the actual price is.
  
  
**FAQ**
  
  
Q: What happened to the patches for [Unofficial Skyrim Creation Club Content Patches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18975)?
  
A: Pre 2.0 there were indeed patches for those, but they actually broke things. If you're still using them, I recommend you remove them. **Just load Hendraheim TnE after [Unofficial Skyrim Creation Club Content Patches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18975) and you should be fine.**
  
  
Q: Why did you remove the unique displays and crafting stations?! You've made it worse!
  
A: That's subjective.
  
Personally, I don't like displays for unique items as they ruin immersion, especially when the items are already named for their artifact, if
  
the player hasn't even heard of said artifact. It feels too meta for me and conflicts with immersion.
  
As for crafting stations, not every home should have every crafting station by default. You can actually add them to the home, but by crafting them at the workbench. Having every crafting station in a home by default also feels out of place.
  
I understand that these trends are popular among player home mods nowadays, but to be honest, I do not subscribe to them. (Not to mention
  
static clutter...) They fundamentally break immersion. While it may be "convenient," I prioritize immersion and meaningful gameplay over
  
"convenience". I want homes to not only look pretty but also benefit from and work with gameplay mechanics, like the Hearthfire system.
  
I can understand if you have a different perspective and actually prefer these modern player home trends. If so, there are plenty of other player
  
 home mods available on Nexus for you.
  
  
Q: ESPFE?
  
A: Yes.
  
  
Q: Does installing/updating/uninstalling on an existing save work?
  
A: Maybe. ~~I've added some failsafes to make sure script properties update, however, there may be cases even this fails, as Creation Club quests are started on game start. Make sure to make a backup save if installing/updating/uninstalling on an existing save.~~ Updating from pre-2.0 to 2.0+ isn't recommended and will very likely have several persistent refs and properties not updating properly.
  
  
Q: Is there really no other way to use this on an existing save?
  
A: You could try a clean save method to reset the mod and CC content entirely:
  
  
1. Make a backup save, in case things go awry. (make sure you're in an interior, that is NOT Hendraheim.)
  
2. Exit the game.
  
3. Uninstall both the CC Hendraheim plugin (cceejsse004-hall.esl) AND my mod's plugin (Hendraheim - Tweaks and Enhancements.esp) and any other
  
relevant patches.
  
4. Go back in game with both the CC Hendraheim plugin (cceejsse004-hall.esl) AND mymod's plugin (Hendraheim - Tweaks and Enhancements.esp) AND the patches uninstalled.
  
5. Make a save.
  
6. Exit game.
  
7. Clean the save you made in step 5, using [Fallrim Tools](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5031/). (If uncertain how, please look up some guides.)
  
8. Go back in game and load the cleaned save.
  
9. Wait about a minute for the scripts to properly update.
  
10. Make another save.
  
11. Exit the game.
  
12. Reinstall CC Hendraheim plugin (cceejsse004-hall.esl) AND my mod's plugin (Hendraheim - Tweaks and Enhancements.esp) and the patches.
  
13. Load the save made in step 10.
  
14. Profit? If everything is well, you'll be able to redo the quest from scratch and proceed the way you should have.
  
  
This won't guarantee it will work though, but I've heard several users for whom it did work.
  
  
Q: Is this compatible with <insert mod>?
  
A: I don't know by heart. You might need to check yourself.
  
  
Q: Will you make a patch for <insert mod>?
  
A: Only if it's a mod I use myself or plan on using, I have enough time and I actually like the idea. Otherwise, feel free to do it yourself. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: I have a suggestion to improve the mod. Can you do it?
  
A: Maybe, if I have time and I like the idea, I'll consider it.
  
  
Q: Will you port this to <insert platform>?
  
A: No, I myself only support the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If someone else wants to port it, feel free. (see permission) If you decide to port it, you yourself take full responsibility to offer support to said port. I will not provide no support for any ports by third parties.
  
  
Q: I use a ported version of this mod on <insert platform> and I have a problem. Can you help?
  
A: I don't provide any support for third party ports on other platforms than the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If you have issues, you should adress the person that ported it.
  
  
Q: Does this work on Skyrim 1.6+, aka "Anniversary Edition"?
  
A: Yes, it should.
  
  
Q: Why don't your mods use MCMs and instead use this janky console command system to set globals?
  
A: I am not a fan of MCMs. You can set the globals by making a patch in xEdit. I have no plans of changing this. If you want to add an MCM, feel free. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: Why don't you use FOMODs?
  
A: That would require reuploading the entire mod, in question, even if I only make a small change. My internet is limited and reuploading the files each time will take a huge chunk of my monthly volume.
