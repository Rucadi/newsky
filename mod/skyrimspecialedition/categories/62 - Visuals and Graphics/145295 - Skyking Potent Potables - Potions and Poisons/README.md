New high quality mesh and texture replacement for all potions and poisons within Skyrim. Featuring 1k, 2k , and 4k options, ENB/CS glow, animated liquids, and clear glass bottles.

  
**Overview:**This is a vanilla friendly mod that offers new HQ textures and meshes for the potions and poisons in Skyrim. Perfect for compatibility with mods requiring vanilla sized and shaped meshes, for those who want to preserve the look and feel of Skyrim but want modern comforts like ENB glow, animation, and actual glass bottles.**1.3 Is the Final Version**I am considering this mod completed. Barring any issues, no further updates are planned for this mod.
  
  
There is a known issue with the white phial potion as it doesn't work with **Ultimate Animated Potions NG.** The white phial potion also doesn't work in that mod. So I believe its an issue with that mod. When it's fixed, this mod should work with no further update.
  
**[b]Features:**[/b]Featuring 1k, 2k, and 4k textures, all new bottle meshes, animated liquid inside glass bottles, and enb glow. Also,
  
 there are patches for **Ultimate Animated Potions NG**, a non-enb glow version, and for cs light glow. **[b]**
  
Install:[/b]
  
Install with your mod manager of choice and place below other mods that offer meshes or textures for potions and poisons.
  
If your potions are too small, pick up [ENB Light Inventory Fix (ELIF)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66411) **IF YOU USE THE NO GLOW VERSION:**You must have the 1k, 2k, or 4k file PLUS the No Glow file.**Compatibility:**
  
Compatible with ENB and CS for the glow effect.
  
Compatible with anything as long as this overwrites mods supplying potion and poison meshes and textures.
  
Ensure your ENB/CS is properly set up to enable ENB/CS glow.
  
  
**Note:**
  
This mod DOES NOT alter potions and poisons effects, skills, alchemy, drop rate, locations/placements, etc. This mod only replaces meshes and textures.
