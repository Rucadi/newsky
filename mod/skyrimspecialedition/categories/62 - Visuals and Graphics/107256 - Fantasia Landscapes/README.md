From the creator of the Skyland series of mods, Fantasia is a new approach to landscape textures. With a focus on fantasy, Fantasia Landscapes features all new colorful textures with larger, bold details. Fantasia also offers a complete complex parallax option. Textures include all landscapes, roads, bridges, mountains, caves, and mines found throughout Skyrim plus so much more. These textures were created and exported in 4k and then converted to 2k and 1k from the 4k source files.

**This Isn't Skyland:**
  
I made this mod because I wanted to create a new landscape texture overhaul with new found inspiration from other games, movies, artists, and to have no rules. By the time Skyland ended, making textures became more of a assembly line because the process became so refined. If I got too creative the textures wouldn't blend with other Skyland mods and textures. This mod allowed me to be creative with each texture, new colors and details, and just to have fun. I hope you enjoy it.**1.5 Update**

*1k - 4k comparison (Parallax not shown) - The 4k title disappears for some reason, but after 2k is the 4 example.* 
  
  
**Install**:
  
Choose between Fantasia 1k, 2k, or 4k and download your preference with your mod manager or manually
  
Choose if you want yellow tundra textures. They are offered in 1k, 2k, and 4k. Download also if desired.
  
If you want parallax, download the parallax file that matches your desired resolution 1k, 2k, or 4k.
  
  
Install with mod manager like any other mod. Place below other landscape texture mods.
  
**To Enable Parallax**
  
To install parallax, choose a main file (Fantasia Landscapes 1k, 2k, or 4k). Then choose the appropriate parallax textures (1k, 2k or 4k). You'll need both mods. Place the parallax mod *after* the main Fantasia mod. The ESP file included is for Terrain Helper. Place in your patches section.
  
  
[Install Parallax Gen](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120946) to ensure your landscape meshes like mountains and dirt cliffs look proper.
  
  
[Install Terrain Helper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/143149) to ensure you do not get seams with the transition from landscape to meshes such as landscape blending into a dirt cliff or gravel skirt around boulders.
  
  
Open your enb series ini file within your game folder and set the flags as seen below (or copy/paste from below):
  
  

  
* EnableTerrainParallax = false
EnableComplexGrass =true
  
* EnableComplexGrassCollisions =true
EnableTerrainBlending = true
  
* EnableComplexParallax = true
EnableComplexParallaxShadows = true
  
* EnableComplexTerrainParallax = true
EnableComplexTerrainParallaxShadows = true
  
* EnableComplexMaterial = true
EnableDynamicCubemap = false
  

  
**Note:**
  
This mod WILL NOT retexture the grass in the city of Whiterun. Those are city textures and are based on whatever mod is retexturing your Whiterun. To retexture that requires new cobblestones and stone walls which is outside the scope of this mod.
  
  
**Suggested Mods:**Here's a list of mods I use with Fantasia that I feel work well and enhance your experience. I place these BEFORE Fantasia.
  

  
* [Blended Roads](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8834)﻿ - For the road meshes
[Enhanced Rocks and Mountains](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85196)﻿ and it's complex parallax mesh mod.
  
* [Auto Parallax](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/79473)﻿ - Saves me From having to download lots of meshes for parallax. I put at the top of my load order
[Skyland Bits and Bobs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/95032)﻿
  
* [Skyland AIO (architecture)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34179)﻿
[Simplicity of Snow](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56235)﻿ or [Better Dynamic Snow 3](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9121)﻿ (**not** v2)
  

**Parallax Help:**
  
These textures are complex parallax compatible. I do not offer training or advice for parallax. I simply supply the textures. It's up to you to already have parallax set up for your game via community shaders or an enb, auto parallax or parallax meshes, and have your enb series ini file set up correctly. Please don't bog down my comment section for training and tutorials on parallax. Keep the comments mod specific.

Thank you to everyone who joined our stream over the last month while I made this mod. Thanks to those on the discord who tested the mod and gave positive feedback and found any errors, bugs, or missing textures.
