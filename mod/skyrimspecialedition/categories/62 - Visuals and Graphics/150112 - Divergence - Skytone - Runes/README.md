[font=Arial]Divergence: Skytone formerly known as just Divergence, is a mod series created to retexture Skyrim.
  
  
The purpose of Divergence is to deviate from the original source while still bearing some semblance of the original. It was inspired by ﻿Sforzinda's Variations. This series of mods are heavily stylized and is meant to have a more fantasy look. It is more vibrant and colorful and has more contrast than vanilla Skyrim. It is darker by design. If you're looking for more subdued tones and realism, this is not the mod for you.
  
  
At its base, Divergence: Skytone is comprised of vanilla Skyrim textures upscaled to 4K. They are then cleaned up and recolored. Some colors are retained, others are changed. It is supposed to be very vanilla-plus but some things may have been heavily altered.

• This mod retextures all the spell runes for base Skyrim and the Dragonborn DLC.
  
[font=Arial]• Pure texture replacer so it should be fully compatible with everything else.
