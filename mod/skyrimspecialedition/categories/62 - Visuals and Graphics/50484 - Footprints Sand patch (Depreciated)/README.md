Footprints Sand Patch[/color][/font]
  
  
Adds Sand and Mud prints to hexabit's [Footprints](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3808)﻿. Mud textures by [Vai1lyn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/88905823) as of version 0.5
  
  
**[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]About:[/font]**
  
I found it a bit immersion breaking when footprints did not appear on the sandy shores of the north coast, especially when moving between snow and sand. Mud prints are also a nice addition. This should also work for some tropical climate mods that did not include their own fixes. Mud prints are also a nice addition.
  
  
[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]**\*note:** As Skyrim landscapes frequently consist of several layered textures there are areas where footprints don't work at all because the material used for that section of the landscape does not match MaterialSand or MaterialMud (this mod), MaterialAsh or MaterialSnow (Footprints).
  
Conversely, you may see footprints in odd places if one or more of the materials affected by footprints was used as part of the landscape.[/font]

**[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]Compatibility:[/font]**~~If you use weather mods that add snow and snowstorms to regions that did not have them in vanilla Skyrim ([Obsidian](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12125) and [Serious Weathers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49847) for example) and use [powerofthree's tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51073), make sure that Dynamic Snow Material is disabled:~~ **Fixed in Poweofthree's Tweaks v1.5.0**

```
[font=Courier New]﻿;Applies snow material to all statics with directional snow
  
Dynamic Snow Material = false[/font]
```

~~otherwise you will get snowy footprints in some odd areas, even when it is not snowing. I doubt this can be fixed, but then you never know.~~

**Future plans:**[/font]
  
-I~~mprove sand textures~~. done as of version 0.8
  
-~~Determine if it will be possible to add footprints to river and lake shores. There is not as much MaterialMud in Skyrim used in these areas as expected~~. done as of version 0.9
