This is my final weather mod, and the culmination of nearly a decade of weather modding experience.

-SnowFall ENB
  
-Dolomite Weathers (Nexus Mod of the Month 2/2017)

**Recommendations:**

  
* Azurite III is designed to look misty without the use of volumetric mist mods
[Cathedral Series](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/50222836?tab=user+files)
  
* [Enhanced Volumetric Lighting and Shadows﻿](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63725/?) - so moonlight at night aligns with the moon
[Community Shaders](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86492)﻿, [CS - Complex Grass Lighting﻿](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86502?), [CS - Screen Space Shadows](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93209)
  
* [Azurite Horizons ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/103633)﻿﻿[﻿](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93209)﻿

**Features:**
  
The list of features is exhaustive and some of it too technical to discuss here, but notable Improvements include the following:
  
  
-Designed to work with or without ENB/community shaders.
  
-HDR filmic tone mapping which prevents brights (ie snow, pale skin) from being over exposed, and similarly the contrast settings prevent darks from crushing to blacks
  
-Consistent settings for HDR and volumetric lighting result in improved weather transitions and greatly simplify ENB creation 
  
-Normal maps have way more depth which makes the world look more 3D (DALC improvements)
  
-Pseudo-ambient occlusion of underside of objects (DALC improvements)
  
-Volumetric lighting is more directional so you only really see it when looking at the sun (prevents the entire scene from being washed out)
  
-8k galaxy and star textures from Cathedral Weathers have been improved (no more twinkle cross stars and greater contrast)
  
-Consistent sneak detection depending on weather type and time of day. The getlightlevels have been standardized across weathers so that bright, cloudy, and rainy/stormy weathers all have unique light levels for sneaking so that sneaking is easier during stormy weather and harder during clear weather (please note these levels are still below the vanilla ones which makes sneaking outdoors a bit easier across the board)
  
-“Effects lighting” for particles/mist/smoke not overly bright at night.
  
-Rain and snow are not overly bright at night due to increased transparency. Furthermore, rain is not grey scale and has pseudo refraction of colors 
  
-Snowflake textures are made from ~20 micron resolution stereographic photographs produced by the Particle Flux Analytics Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera (MASC), thereby making these the most realistic virtual snowflakes in the world 
  
-There is no horizon seam. Skyrim has a render distance of about 350,000 distance units, and anything after that abruptly cuts off creating a hard disconnect with the world and the atmosphere. Azurite fixes this by completely obscuring the edge of the world with fog that matches the atmosphere perfectly in color. Use of alternative sky meshes is highly discouraged as many will break this fix or break blending of distant terrain with fogs, clouds, and sky gradients.
  
-Version 1.x includes [MangaClub's Vivid Fogs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59809)﻿ , please endorse his original mod and send him your thanks. Please set your particle count to 6000 in SkyrimPrefs.ini, [Particles], iMaxDesired=6000. This was removed from versions above 2.x
  
-Includes sunset/sunrise cloud textures from Cathedral Weathers
  
-Seasonal weather variation toggleable via power
  
-Somber weathers option which makes Skyrim foggy and rainy about 80% of the time
  
-Customize night brightness, interior brightness, saturation, contrast, brightness, warmth
  
  
**Compatibility:**
  

  
* Audio-overhauls like AOS or SOS require a patch for versions above 2.50
This mod uses filmic tone mapping, but don't worry- included is an ini file that also adjusts global brightness and contrast so that all other mods you are using will be compatible with the new tone maps. The filmic tone mapping allows for bright scenes without white-wash or clipping.
