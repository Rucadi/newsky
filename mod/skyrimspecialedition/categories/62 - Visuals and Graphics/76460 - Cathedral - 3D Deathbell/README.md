This mod was created from photos I took of the alpine bell flower, Campanula. I deviated slightly from the vanilla design here. The vanilla model has the flowers stacked on top of each other, one within the other. The real flower has layers of flower clusters. During development, both options were put to a vote, and there was near unanimous consensus that the model based on the real flower was visually superior. 
  
  
Regarding performance, the main model is about 2500 triangles, which is about 5x higher poly than the vanilla model. Regardless, this increase in triangle count is trivial and will not affect performance.
