Just as the title says....this is nothing fancy or perfect or anything, but I think that it's better for immersion(in my opinion.)
  
Ya see, I had to put up with a very firm mattress for years, up until a week ago, and anything that reminds me of that horrible mattress gives me anxiety and bad memories, so to help with this issue, I gave the meshes a new specific bed texture.  It is nowhere near perfection....it was made just to make me satisfied, and hopefully it'll help others in the same way.  I have a very comfy new mattress now...the days of sleeping on stone are far behind me, both for reality, and for the world of Skyrim.
  
I'm gonna keep this description simple, as the mod is pretty simple....no changes to the mesh itself because I was too lazy....so of course, it may not be up to the standards of some in the community.  But I made the textures and the normals from scratch, with loving care.  :P
