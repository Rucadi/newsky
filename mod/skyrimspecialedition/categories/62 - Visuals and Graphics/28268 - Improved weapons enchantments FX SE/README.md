# Improved weapons enchantments FX SE
- Author: darkman24 and Soulmancer
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

Original Fire Texture and Alternate Shock Texture included with main install, but Alternate Fire Texture and Original Shock Texture are available in the Optional Files.
  
  
This mod is a simple texture replacer, which I made because other similar mods didn't suit my taste fully. It modify a few FX shaders used by magic effects of weapon enchantments replacing textures and setting animations for them. New effects are mixed and combined from some free textures and their minimum size is 512x512 pixels.  Unfortunately I didn’t add particle shaders because I don’t know how to edit nif files, I tried to follow the guides, but my every attempt ended in failure.
  
  
How they look in game is shown on this video: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3j5jyQhV64](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3j5jyQhV64))
  
  
 
  
Thanks BDMods !!!
  
  
The effects are more visible in a dark environment, I didn't want make them too bright. But if there will be a need I can do a version where they will be brighter.
  
  
The only issue that cannot be fixed is related to the way how effects shaders are applied to the texture. In most cases e.g. in swords the blade texture is divided into several pieces sometimes arranged at different angles on texture. So it is possible that you will see the boundaries between these pieces and even the animation will move in different directions on the weapon.
  
  
Compatibility:
  
This mod is incompatible with any mod that alters effect shaders used by magic effects of weapon enchantments.
  
Important: This mod does not override/edit any textures from the vanilla game, so it is fully compatible with any mods that utilize effect textures.
  
Compatible with Summermyst just load this mod after Summermyst!
