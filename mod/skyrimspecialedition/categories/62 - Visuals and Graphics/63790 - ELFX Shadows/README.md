> [WiZkiD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/6312426)﻿ I have to say that you and [Nicola](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/1316802)﻿ have made one of my secret dreams come true.

> The atmosphere just pours out of the screen in every location I have visited. It's the good, old ELFX vibe that I'm used to and love, plus the changes you've made, that are amazing and take this mod to a whole new level (okay, in Valthume where I was yesterday the light is flashing, but I used the version you gave me, Nicola sent me the latest one yesterday, I haven't installed it yet)
>   
> It's just a piece of coveted, professional work in which you put your heart and soul. It just shows in every detail and I always appreciate something like that. Many thanks for all your amazing work. ﻿*[/font][font=Georgia]

[font=Georgia]﻿ELFX Shadows is a revamp, an enhancement of the possibilities offered by the Skyrim Engine, a collection of Enhanced Lights and FX fixes all in one in an ESL flagged ESP. The main features are represented by the presence of shadows projected by window frames in a realistic way and above all by the overcoming
  
of the Skyrim engine limits by using a complex scripting technique which leaves the engine untouched.
  
Where possible we have far exceeded the four shadowcasting lights limit and all this without the slightest light flickering issue occurring, even with a lit torch in hand.[/font][font=Georgia] 
  
Using ELFX Shadows also reduces the number of plugins needed for Enhanced Lights and FX to obtain the most satisfying gaming experience possible, in fact you will no longer need ELFX Fixes or even SMIM Performace patches. Another fundamental thing, we have solved some historical bugs that plagued the Anamorfus mod, such as the one related to the Thalmor Embassy so you will no longer need to touch the main esp.
  
Although it is not essential we advise you to use ELFX Enhancer, ELFX Shadows fomod includes various custom version of ELFX Enhancer we made to better work the main plugin.
  
[/font][font=Georgia]Since ELFX Shadow does not use any kind of fake light the use of an ENB present is not necessary, our mod works perfectly with and without ENB. We recommend using the NEW [RUDY ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4796?) ﻿specially created to work with elfx shadow[/font]
  
  
  
  
[font=Georgia]--Features Summary--[/font]

1. [font=Georgia][color=#d8d8d8][size=4]Shadows projected by window frames
[/font]
  
[font=Georgia]Exceeding the limits of the Skyrim engine (more than 4 shadowcasting lights per cell, NOT at engine level)[/font]
  
  
- [font=Georgia]ELS flagged ESP so it doesn't count toward the plugin limit[/font]
[font=Georgia]ELFX Fixes already included in the main esp[/font]
  
- [font=Georgia]Tons of new fixes for Enhanced Lights and FX[/font]
[font=Georgia]Works with or without ENB binaries + presets[/font]

[/size]
  
[/color]
  
  
[font=Georgia]Note: we used vanilla windows frames so to obtain the best result you should use vanilla windows textures or [Rustic Windows](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1937)[/font][font=Georgia]. [/font]
  
[font=Georgia]Since ELFX didn't touch hearthfire we highly suggest you to use [/font][font=Georgia][ELFX Shadows - Hearthfire Light Addon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64423) by [mechanicalpanda](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/6313005), his mod is a really good complement to ELFX Shadows.﻿﻿[font=Georgia]
