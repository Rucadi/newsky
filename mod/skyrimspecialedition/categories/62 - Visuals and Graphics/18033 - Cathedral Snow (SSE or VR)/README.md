Cathedral Snow comes in multiple versions. Version 1 and 2 are reworks of Sparkling Snow (Proof of Concept) by [T4gtr34um3r](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/8933251). Version 3 is a rework and hybridization of [Real Snow HD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15957) by Luxor. Version 4 is a rework and hybridization of snow from [YALO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1839) by SteveoWasHere. Version 4 also includes glacier textures from [YALO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1839) and a few ice textures from [Glorious Glaciers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24122). I've repainted, blended, and selectively altered mip-map layers to reduce tiling while keeping the nearby snow busy and undulated to help hide some inherent issues with Skyrim lighting and shadowing of landscapes. I've chosen a brightness about half way between vanilla Skyrim snow and most other snow mods, so it shouldn't be too bright or too dark, and it should approximately match whatever tree LODs you are using. The mod comes with a plugin to improve "dynamic" snow shaders on material objects.

There are two primary philosophies when it comes to modding, Parlor and Cathedral, originally coined by the former modder, [Wrye](http://wryemusings.com/Cathedral%20vs.%20Parlor.html).
  
  
> In the ***Parlor*** view, we consider mods as privately owned works of art displayed in a modder's parlor. We invite others to come appreciate our work. We directly receive compliments and endorsements, encouraging us to produce further work.

  
> In the ***Cathedral*** ***Concept***, we consider modding a joint effort. We share our work with each other to foster further mod development, to keep the community alive, and to contribute in the construction of mods of monumental scale. Individually, our contributions may be small and not worth doing for themselves, but by each person contributing something, we construct something larger and more worthwhile than any of us could do on our own.
