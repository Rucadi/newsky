Hate vanilla interior mists, smoke, and fog? Be a **SIMP** today!
  
These effects were too intense for my liking and the only options I could find outright removed them which I felt lessened the ambiance. So I've made some edits to retain these effects without them hindering your vision. This was made with an edited version of Cabbage ENB so if you use a different ENB your mileage may vary.
  
  
I recommend using this along with wSkeever's [No More Blinding Fog - SSE Port](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/87342).

No ESP. These are loose NIF files. Make sure they load after any other mod that edits these files. Not compatible with mods that alter or remove the same files. Refommended to load after any conflicting mods so it wins. Safe to add or remove at any time!
