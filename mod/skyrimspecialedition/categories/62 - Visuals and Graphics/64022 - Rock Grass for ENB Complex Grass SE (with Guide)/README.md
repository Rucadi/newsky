**FAQ:**
  
  
1) Will this work without ENBSeries?
  
• The meshes and textures will work, but you will not have normal map effects or specularity.
  
  
2) Are there any big hits in performance?
  
• This feature has been in development for 2 days only and throughout testing, no significant drop in performance was noted. This of course could change depending on your grass settings & grass mods installed.
  
  
3) Is this feature compatible with other Grass mods?
  
• Yes! But patches will need to be made to them to enable Complex Grass effects.
  
  
4) Will this break existing Grass mods?
  
• No! They will be ignored by ENBSeries as they do not contain the required texture atlas layout. They should however still gain some additional lighting benefits.
