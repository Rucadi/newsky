**Original:** [Runic Mage Armor- Flesh Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39013)
  
-I reworked the visuals from the original because I updated my Reshade/ENB
  
-This version looks better since there is less noise in the graphics and more variety in the effects
  
**Recommended Mods:**-I also updated and finalized the effects for my other mod: [Runic Enchantment- Weapon Glow Replacer﻿](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38948) ﻿-Reworks visuals of weapon glow in enchanted weapons
