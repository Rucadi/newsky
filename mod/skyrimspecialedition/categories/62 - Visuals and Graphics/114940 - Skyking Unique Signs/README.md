**Skyking Unique Signs**
  
  
Skyking Unique Signs covers all of the shops found throughout Skyrim and gives each shop a unique sign design. The designs take inspiration from the stores location, owners, back stories, and more. Designed to be used with [Skyking Signs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/112902)﻿.

  
**[size=4][b][size=4][b][size=4][b]2.1 Update**[/b][/size][/b][/size][/b][size=4][size=4]Tweaked parallax textures to reduce distortion.
  
[/size][/size]**[b]
  
2.0 Update**[/b]Now includes complex parallax textures and meshes. Only requires Skyking Signs and BOS. Now has a FOMOD installer.
  
**Features:**
  
Unique signs for all shops in Skyrim including Markarth and Solitude.
  
  
**Install:**
  
Choose Normal or BOS version.
  
Install normally with your mod manager
  
Place after any sign mod and JK mods (patches are constantly being added here or on their mod pages like COTN.)
  
  
My parallax option ONLY covers parallax for the signs. The wooden posts holding them use whatever textures you have for cities and villages. If they do not have parallax textures, you will have glossy wood posts. I did it this way so that the wood posts match the architecture they are in and use the textures from your load order for consistency.
  
  
**How To Set Up Parallax:**
  
*Use these settings in ENBSeries.ini*
  
  
EnableTerrainParallax=false
  
EnableComplexParallax=true
  
EnableComplexParallaxShadows=true
  
EnableTerrainBlending=true
  
EnableComplexTerrainParallax=true
  
EnableComplexTerrainParallaxShadows=true
  
EnableComplexMaterial=false
  
  
**Compatibility:**
  
Designed to use with [Skyking Signs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/112902).
  
Compatible most mods.
  
Do not use with other mods that alter shops signs including blowing in the wind.
  
  
**Special Thanks:**
  
To everyone in during the development of this mod and those in our discord that tested the mod for me. Special thanks also to Leostevano for the BOS version.
