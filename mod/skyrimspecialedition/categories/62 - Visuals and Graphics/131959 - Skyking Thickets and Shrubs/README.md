Skyking Thickets and Shrubs
  
  
[size=4]This mod here does one thing, but does it well. Replaces the vanilla thickets and dead shrubs with nicer versions. You'll find these in the Tundra and Snowy areas along with the Solstheim area. Not many flora mods hit these 2 plants, so this is what I made as a solution.**[/size][/size]**Update 1.2****[size=5]**[/size]New shrub mesh and textures with better UVs.
  
Updated plants wind sway
  
Removed the need for an esp. Safe to update mid save. **[size=5]**[/size]**Install:**Place after grass mods and other mods that remesh/retexture these plants.**Compatibility:**Anything.**Requirements:**None.
