**Intro:**
  
  
 ﻿This mod is a re-texture/redesign of the [Fate Cards](http://legacy-of-the-dragonborn.wikia.com/wiki/Hall_of_Oddities), collectible items from the mod [Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802).
  
  
 ﻿I've wanted to learn how to work with textures, create my on and stuff like that on Bethesda games. While I was playing the great mod from [icecreamassassin](https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/2846158-icecreamassassin/) I've found these fate cards, and although I was having a blast collecting them and trading with the dude in Windhelm, I was never satisfied with their aesthetics, mainly the lack of a consistency.
  
  
 ﻿So  decided to start learning how to mod textures. Something simple like flat illustrations for these cards is a perfect place to start, and so I begin creating a redesign of the hole thing.
  
  

**Original Design/Textures:**

 ﻿Each deck had only one image for the front  of the cards (from II to X, and A J Q K  all have the same illustrations) and in the back side cards were some illustrations for each deck, but with no common theme between. 
  
  
**New Ones:**

Each deck now has unique images for the front. One for the cards II to X, and different ones for each A, J, Q & K. All related by the same "theme" of each deck. There are 10 decks.

The new textures are 1k.

**Credits:**
  
  
Illustrations are from the inspiring **Elder Scrolls V: The Art of Skyrim - Official Art Book**, so all the credits goes to it and to each artist involved on it's creation, and Bethesda for creating this game. 
  
  
Once again, thanks **icecreamassassin** for the permission, and for your awesome mod. 
  
  
The layout, borders, logo in the back side of the cards and all other PS thinkering was my idea, yay.

Enjoy.
