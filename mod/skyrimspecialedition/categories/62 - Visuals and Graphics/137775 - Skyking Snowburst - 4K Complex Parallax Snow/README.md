A complete retexture for the snow landscape textures throughout Skyrim. Offered in 1k, 2k, or 4k, Snowburst features parallax and complex parallax support plus compatibility with Blended Roads, Terrain Parallax Blending Fix, and Parallax Gen. You can also choose to not use the parallax textures/options for those who do not want that.
  
  
Easy to use FOMOD installer included. Simply answer the questions and the installer will take care of the rest.

  
**Install:**
  
Install with your mod manager of choice and answer the questions in the FOMOD. Very easy and straight forward.
  
Do not manually unpack. Use the FOMOD. Please run Parallax Gen, if you use it, after installing this mod.
  
  
**Compatibility:**
  
Compatible with anything as long as your load order is correct. Works with ENB and CS perfectly fine along with any snow, landscape, and mountain mods. A patch is built in for those who use Blended Roads and Better Dynamic Snow.
  
**Requirements:**
  

  
* If you do not want parallax, or if you don't use Blended Roads, Terrain Parallax Blending Fix, ENB, or Community Shaders, then you have zero requirements.
If you want parallax then you must have an ENB or Community Shaders installed.
  
* Not required, but I suggest using Better Dynamic Snow or Simplicity of Snow.
Blended Roads is not required but it is supported.
  
* Terrain Parallax Blending Fix isn't required but HIGHLY suggested. Support is built into this mod and you do not have to worry about moving files around. The FOMOD will do it all for you.

  
**Load Order:**
  

  
* Enhanced Rocks and Mountains or Majestic Mountains
ERM or MJ parallax meshes
  
* Terrain Parallax Blending Fix
Snow Mod
  
* Landscape Mod (examples like Skyland or Fantasia)
Parallax mods for your landscape mods
  
* Skyking Snowburst - The mod you are currently installing
If you chose to install the BDS patch, then place Skyking Snowburst.esp after BDS' esp file.
  
  
* Parallax Gen Output <-- rerun this after installing this mod.
