**Compatiblity:

Works with mods that **do not** add lights to lamp posts. Although, works with LOSII but you'll have to posts with lights near each other. If you find a compatibility issue, please kindly let me know so I can fix it ASAP.
  
  
**The Lit Road Signs esp file** is not compatible with any Arthmoor mods since he moved a lot of the road signs.[size=5][font=Times New Roman][size=4][font=Arial]
