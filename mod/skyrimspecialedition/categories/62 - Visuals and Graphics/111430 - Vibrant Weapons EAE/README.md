This mod adds particle-based visual effects to the vanilla Fire, Frost and Shock weapon enchantments, and possibly many mod-added enchantments that do Fire, Frost or Shock damage. Additionally, it adds unique visuals to combination enchantments, i.e. a weapon with both Fire and Frost damage enchantments receives unique Frostfire visuals.
  
  
The shape of the effects adapt to the weapon, with some limitations. Each effect is custom made (based on the shapes of [Believable weapons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37737)), and only the type of weapon (not its exact shape) is used to determine the shape of the effects. Unusually-shaped weapons will look bad.
  
  
Currently supported weapon types are the seven vanilla melee types plus Curved Swords. The Curved Swords include only the vanilla scimitar. To make another sword count as curved, give it the "WeapTypeCurved" keyword (conveniently by KID).
  
  
  
The mod is a reimplementation of my old mod [Vibrant weapons - Fire Frost Shock](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40087), using the new framework [Enchantment Art Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/105492) by Shekhinaga/SeaSparrow. This framework does roughly what my old mod did, but potentially avoiding some instability issues relating to script lag. If this framework is as good as I think it is, I might just switch over to it for good. But it's new and untested, so I'll release this as a separate mod for now.
  
  
This mod is standalone from (and should not be combined with) my old Vibrant Weapons mod, but you do need the Enchantment Art Extender.
