I have had DrJacopo's Cathedral - 3D mountain flowers in my load order for a while now, and while they're very nice I was ready to change things up a bit. I looked at several other mountain flower replacements on Nexus, but didn't find anything that was quite what I was looking for. That's when I decided to see if I could do anything with the Cathedral - 3D mountain flower texture to freshen up my game some.
  
  
**What does this mod do?**
  
It replaces all of the textures in DrJacopo's Cathedral - 3D Mountain Flowers with new textures that alter the appearance of the mountain flowers. There is also a I want them all - Base Object Swapper version of this mod that will let you replace mountain flowers with either all of the options from this mod or just the two more realistic options. The I want them all - Base Object Swapper option also fixes the names of the mountain flowers when you're harvesting them so that they show the color of the mountain flower that you're harvesting.
  
  
**Installation**
  

  
1. Make sure you have [Cathedral - 3D Mountain Flowers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41312)﻿ installed. You will need the esp and mesh files for this mod to work.
Choose the texture options that you want for this mod and download that file. If you can't choose or want to combine more than one texture option from this mod, use the I want them all - Base Object Swapper main file. This is a FOMOD that will let you choose the options you want to combine. You can combine all three or just two and three if you prefer having only more realistic looking flowers.
  
2. If you use Base Object Swapper and feel that the non-snowy versions of the flowers are too big, you can download the options BOS file to make the flowers 70% of their original size. Just merge it with the main file. This file is not needed if you use the I want them all - Base Object Swapper main file.
If you use [Interesting NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194)﻿ and [Cathedral - 3D Black Mountain Flowers - for Interesting NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60058?tab=files)﻿, download the option texture replacement that matches the option for the stand-alone replacement you installed. If you're using the I want them all version, choose the option that matches the option you chose for your inventory flower.
  

  
**Compatibility Notes for Version 1.04**
  

  
1. **Alternate Textures Options 1, 2, and 3 (both normal and less saturated)** - Only replaces the Cathedral 3D Mountain Flowers textures and does not include meshes. **Compatible with:** Mods that only alter the ESP of Cathedral 3D Mountain flowers as long as they do not change what mesh/textures are being used. Also compatible with new meshes so long as the meshes do not change the name/location of the textures being used. **Not Compatible with:** Mods that change the texture path of the Cathedral 3D Mountains Flowers. Can conflict with Origins of Forest and Cathedral 3D Pine Grass grass textures because one of the grass textures shares the same columbine.dds name as the purple Cathedral Mountain Flowers.
**I Want Them All Base Object Swapper version -** Adds new varieties of mountain flowers with new meshes, textures, and an ESL flagged ESP to add those new variants to the game. **Compatibility:** This version is less compatible with other Cathedral Mountain Flower Mods. The main texture that you choose will have the same compatibility as Options 1, 2, and 3. The new mountain flower varieties will not work with any mod that alters Cathedral 3D Mountain Flowers unless that mod only alters the placement of snowy mountain flowers.
  

  
**Tips For Origins of Forest and/or Cathedral 3D Pine Grass Complex Grass users**
  
Origins of Forest, Cathedral 3D Pine Grass, Cathedral 3D Mountain Flowers, and this mod all have a texture called columbine.dds that uses the same file
  
 path causing a conflict. If the grass mods are winning this texture conflict, purple mountain flowers will use the texture from the grass mod. This becomes very noticeable when using complex grass textures because portions of the purple mountain flowers become transparent.
  
  

  
* **Workaround** - Modify your load order so that the textures from this mod wins the conflict with the grass mod.
