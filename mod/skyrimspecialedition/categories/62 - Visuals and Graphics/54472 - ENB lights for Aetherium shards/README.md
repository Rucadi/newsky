# ENB lights for Aetherium shards

Using the ENB particle lights feature this mod makes the Aetherium objects you meet during the quest **Lost to the Ages** emit a nice blue glow.
  
  
You'll need to have installed ENB with binaries that support particle lights feature for this mod to work.
  
  
To keep the mod as light as possible and not require any plugins, I haven't modified any of the quest reward items.
  
  
The mod is compatible with anything that doesn't replace the models for aetherium shards/crest, aetherium forge or the forge entrance. Texture mods should be all compatible.
  
  
  
Thank you to all mod authors who have previously made mods with enb lights for inspiring this mod.
