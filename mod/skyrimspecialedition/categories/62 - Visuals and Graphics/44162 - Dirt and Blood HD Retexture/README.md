DIRT AND BLOOD HD RETEXTURE
  
by Nolbear
  
  
  
WHY DID I MAKE THIS?
  
  
I'm a big fan of [Dirt and Blood - Dynamic Visual Effects](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38886) by JaySerpa, but I've always felt like its textures could use a little love. With that in mind, I decided to rework some of the textures from the mod. My goals were to:
  
  

  
* Create a truly "covered in dirt/blood" look, to match the status effect descriptions from the mod
Make the dirt/blood overlays more distinct from each other
  
* Increase the resolution and get rid of the "pixelated" look of the overlay textures
Color-match the blood overlays with Enhanced Blood Textures
  
* Make the soap bubble particle look less "cartoony"

  
If any of those things sound good to you, this mod may be for you!
  
  
  
OPTIONAL PLUGIN
  
  
There is an optional, ESL-flagged plugin included with this mod. All it does is tweak the visibility of the dirt shaders to my taste, as I found them too hard to see in the early stages and too dark in the final stage. It's up to you whether or not to install it. If you do, just make sure it's loaded after *Dirt and Blood - Dynamic Visuals.esp*.
  
  
  
COMPATIBILITY
  
  
**Enhanced Blood Textures:** This mod is COMPATIBLE with Enhanced Blood Textures. In fact, the blood overlays were made using EBT assets (with permission from dDefinder). The installer includes variants to match the darker/brighter options from EBT, in case you use either of those.
  
  
**Your ENB preset:** A couple users have posted about graphical issues with certain ENB presets, namely Silent Horizons and Photorealistic Tamriel. I haven't been able to replicate the issue on my end, so I don't know what a potential fix may be, if there is one. If you encounter this issue and know of a fix, please let me know.
  
  
**Just Blood - Dirt and Blood Lite:** This mod is COMPATIBLE with [Just Blood - Dirt and Blood Lite](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46501) by JaySerpa. Choose "No" when asked if you want to install the optional plugin. It's only needed for the full version of D&B.
  
  
  
FAQ
  
  
**Q: Do I need the plugin?**A: No, it's optional. It just tweaks the visibility of the dirt overlays to my personal taste, as I found them too hard to see at low levels and a little too overpowering at the "covered in dirt" stage. Refer to the images for a comparison with and without the plugin installed.
  
  
**Q: How does it look with/without ENB?**
  
A: I use Rudy's ENB for Cathedral Weathers, so these textures were made with that in mind. That being said, I think they look good both with and without ENB and in all weather/lighting conditions that I've tested so far. I might be open to creating other versions if things aren't looking good with your setup, if you catch me in a good mood...
  
  
**Q: How did you make these?**
  
A: I used Photoshop with the [Intel Texture Works Plugin](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/intel-texture-works-plugin.html). The blood textures were created using assets from [Enhanced Blood Textures SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2357) by dDefinder (with permission). The dirt textures were made with [free brushes](https://www.brusheezy.com/brushes/57770-free-sand-dust-photoshop-brushes) from Brusheezy. The soap bubble came from [here](https://www.hiclipart.com/free-transparent-background-png-clipart-itvdb).
