This is a light overhaul of Auri's pod, your Song of the Green favourite follower. She deserves a fancy pod so I made one.

This mod adds a bunch of things all around and replaces some. I replaced the stone fireplace, improved a bit the crafting area, added a sharpening whell and an alchemist station. Navmesh has been updated accordingly and llght entirely redone. There's a patch for Lux users and a brighter lighting patch if people need it (no ENB or undertuned one).
  
Decoration is a bit more dense than the original mod but I didn't overdid it either. I tried to keep it as light as possible.

No clue, I made the original patch as a standalone and added a patch for Lux users so lighting is using the same templates and not conflcting since I patched Song of the Green already (load Song of the Green / Auri's fancy Pod / Lux / Song of the Green patch / Lux - Auri's fancy pod patch).
  
I also added a patch to increase the overall lighting for non Lux users in case of. Use it if you find the interior lighting too dim.
