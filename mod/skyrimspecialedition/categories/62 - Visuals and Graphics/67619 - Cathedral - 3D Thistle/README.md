# Cathedral - 3D Thistle

A 3D replacer for the dreaded thistle plant. Version 1 is theoretically more performance friendly than the vanilla model. Version 2 is slightly higher poly (I strongly recommend you use this version) but will not affect performance unless you add many thousands of these plants to a small area.
  
  
A patch will be necessary for other mods that replace the thistle model with an esp file (ie 3d plants by maty).
