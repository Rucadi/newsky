***[font=Comic Sans MS]I use [Wet and Cold SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/644) and the Soggy Feet feature from it is always an option i have checked. But the meshes/textures are in my opinion to bright. Very noticeable with ENB presets. So i asked [Rudy102](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/93362) to use his assets from [Rudy fix for Splashes of Storms and ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72985) and have it worked for the soggy feet feature from Wet and Cold.
  
Also takes care of the drips comming from PC and NPC's.

Thats it and nothing more.
  
  
Just install with favorite mod manager and overwrite Wet and Cold SE.
  
  
Also recommended to use is [ToosTruus Choice for R.A.S.S.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59740)
  
  
ENJOY!!!
