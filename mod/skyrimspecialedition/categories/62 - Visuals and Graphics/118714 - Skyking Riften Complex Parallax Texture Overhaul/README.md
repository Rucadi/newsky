Skyking Riften**
  
  
Skyking Riften features all new textures for Riften and the Ratway. Featuring 1k, 2k, or 4k textures and a complex parallax option for those who desire that effect. These textures are designed to give Riften a high quality visual overhaul while also giving it a more storybook fantastical sense.

  
  
**Features**:
  

  
* 1k, 2k, and 4k Textures
Complex Parallax options
  
* Covers Riften and the Ratway

  
**Install**:
  
Install normally with your mod manager or manually place in your games data
  
folder (not recommended).
  
Place in your textures or city textures section.
  
Ensure mods like SMIM and other texture mods are not overwriting this.
  
Windows are included in my mod, but feel free to overwrite with your own window texture mod.
  
Have an enb already installed and set up for complex parallax
  
Install PGPatcher and run it to have parallax meshes or you will not see the parallax effect on the architecture.
  
  
To add parallax, simply download a version of the main file (1k, 2k, or 4k), then download the complex parallax texture mod for it in the "optional" file section. I offer 1k, 2k, and 4k complex parallax versions. Place the complex parallax textures AFTER the main mod like this:
  

  
* Skyking Riften 4k
Skyking Riften Parallax 4k
  

  
**Setting Up The ENB**
  
*Use these settings in ENBSeries.ini*
  
  
EnableTerrainParallax=false
  
EnableComplexParallax=true
  
EnableComplexParallaxShadows=true
  
EnableTerrainBlending=true
  
EnableComplexTerrainParallax=true
  
EnableComplexTerrainParallaxShadows=true
  
EnableComplexMaterial=false
  
**Compatibility**:
  

  
* Compatible with any mods like JK and other city mods. Compatible with any texture mods that retexture as long as this is placed after. Unless you want those textures to show up instead.
Not compatible with any mod that replaces gravestone meshes. You won't break anything, you just won't see these textures or updated meshes.
  
* I leave it up to you to understand parallax, how to install and how to set it up. This mod page is NOT a classroom for parallax and I won't be answering questions about setting it up or if you have any parallax issues. This mod has been extensively tested and parallax works just fine as seen in the screen shots

  
**Special Thanks**:
  
To everyone in the streams during the development of this mod and those in our discord.
