Performance friendly 3D replacer for the clover plant.
  
  
This mod is based on the clovers from Cathedral 3D - Pine Grass, however there are many more 3D clovers in the performance version. This is not a grass mod but replaces the clover plant!
  
  
The performance version is 765 triangles and 1287 vertices, which is slightly above the average complexity for a vanilla plant. 
  
  
For perspective, fps loss was not appreciated for plant models with less than 200,000-500,000 triangles (depending on the vertex count).
