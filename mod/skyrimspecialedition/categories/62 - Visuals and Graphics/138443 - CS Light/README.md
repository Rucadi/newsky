Description

This mod is a collection of configurations for **Light Placer** created by myself and members of the Community Shaders Discord. These configurations are designed to be used with **Community Shaders** and other lighting mods, offering compatibility and customization.
  
**Key Features**:

Covers many objects that emit light in the game like **candles**, **lanterns**, **fires**, **ingredients**, **potions**, **windows**, **effect shaders**, **plants**, **insects** and many more 
  
* Compatibility with any lighting mod.
Designed to work with **Community Shaders** ensuring proper functionality without exceeding the light limit.
  
* Fully customizable which lights should be installed
Fully customizable fade and radius parameters to adjust brightness and light distance
  
* Semi-Optional support for [Inverse Square Lighting](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/153542) (Some jsons are available for ISL only)

**Who Is This Mod For?****This mod is ideal for:**
  
  

  
* Those who use **Light Placer** and wish to enhance compatibility with other lighting mods.
Those who are looking for an alternative for ENB lights, aka particle lights
  

**Requirements****This mod requires the following:**
  
  

  
* **[Community Shaders](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86492)** *(hard requirement)*
**[Light Placer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/127557)** *(hard requirement)*
  
* **[powerofthree's tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51073)**

**Usage Instructions**
  
  

  
1. **Install the required mods** as outlined above.
**Download and install this mod** via your preferred mod manager.
  
2. **In the very first step of the FOMOD**, you'll have four choices. One for vanilla, one for Inverse Square Lighting, one for True Light and one for other lighting mods like Lux CS. For ISL you need the CS feature, and if you're using True Light choose the True Light option instead. If you're using Lux CS, select the last option. After that you will get choices for your corresponding lighting setup, including patches for CC etc.

  

**Customization**

  
1. Review the included **JSON files**, which are named according to their content.
Open the JSON files containing the settings you want to tweak.

  
* **Fade Parameter**: Adjust brightness by increasing or decreasing the value.
**Radius Parameter**: Adjust light distance by modifying this value, this value only works with vanilla bulbs
  
* [size=4]**Size/cutoff Parameter**s: These are for ISL bulbs and control the sharpness of the peak of the curve and the relative radius respectively.[/size]

  
2. Save your changes and type "reloadlp" in the console.

**Notes**
  

  
* **Mixing with ENB lights**: from CS version 1.4 ENB lights are not supported from the side of CS so the enb light mods in your mod list are not contributing to lighting when using CS
[size=4]**When Updating**: When you update the mod, you may have to rerun pgpatcher as it creates new jsons that may override the ones you just updated.[/size]
  

  

**Compatibility**

  

  
* Designed for use with [True light](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/135488) or any other interior lighting mods, provided that configurations are not stacked
[Particle Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65720) - places particle lights but they are inactive when using latest Community Shaders, so **compatible**
  
* [Luminous Atronachs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27732) and [iLluminous Elementals](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/138128) - CS light does not place lights for atronachs, so **fully compatible**
