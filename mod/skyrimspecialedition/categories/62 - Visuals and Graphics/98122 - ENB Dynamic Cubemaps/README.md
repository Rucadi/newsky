Cubemap textures to enable ENBs dynamic cubemaps on vanilla objects for the lazy. Overwrite everything, otherwise you won't have the effect.
  
  
Yes, the reflections are generated in real time.
  
  
ENB dynamic cubemap requires an uncompressed, black 1 pixel sized cubemap to work, you can make your own or use any in this file to enable it for modded objects.
  
  
Kudos for Boris, the ENB author for giving us this feature.
