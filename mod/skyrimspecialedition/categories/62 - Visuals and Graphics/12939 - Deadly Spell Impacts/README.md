**Overview**
  
  
Deadly Spell Impacts increases the variation in impact size, size of the dragon breath impacts, and provides unique textures for several types of impacts:
  

  
* **Fire Spell Impacts:** Choose between using the missile impact for all fire spells (default) or use a spread impact for the "Flames"
    
  and "Wall of Flames" spells and the missile impact for all other fire spells. Includes two texture options and a new melted snow impact.
**Frost** **Spell Impacts:** two texture options
  
* **Lightning Spell Impacts:** four texture options and a new melted snow impact
**Spit Impacts (Spider/Chaurus)**

**INI Settings**
  
The follow INI settings may affect how Deadly Spell Impacts is displayed in the game. It is highly recommended to use [BethINI Pie](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/631) to ensure all INIs are set correctly! Use BethINI Pie or manually check the INI settings below:
  
  
**Skyrim.INI**
  

  
* **fDecalLifetime** = (how long decals will last before being removed in seconds; set up to **300**)
**fDecalLOD0** = (distance some decals are visible; set to at least **8192**, up to 12288)
  
* **fDecalLODFadeStart** = (distance at when decals start to fade from view, set to at least **0.5** and up to 0.9)
**fDecalLODFadeEnd** = (distance at when decals are fully faded from view, set to at least **0.6** and up to 1.0)
  
* *Ensure the LODFadeStart is 0.1 lower than LODFadeEnd!*

**SkyrimPrefs.INI**
  

  
* **bDecals** = **1 (required!)**
**iMaxDecalsPerFrame** = (set to at least **60**; up to 250)
  

  
**Uninstall DSI**
  

  
1. Enter an interior where there are no impacts present and save the game.
Close the game.
  
  
2. Use the mod manger of choice to deactivate and/or remove DSI from the mod list.
When the game is relaunched a warning about a missing plugin will appear. Okay the prompt. When loaded, make another save before continuing to play.
