Enhanced Lights and FX has the goal to create a more dramatic and realistic mood to the Skyrim lights by adding lights to all light sources and removing any light without a source, as well as the addition many more effects like smoke, volumic lights, driples, etc. I made some friendly redesigns as needed too, and some redesigns for more dramatic looking.

**Enhanced Light and FX**
  
  
Should be compatible with any mod that doesn't change light, fx or the meshes it adds, my meshes are a must have, so make sure it overwrites anything it asks to. You can stick with LOOT load order.
  
  
**The ELFX Enhancer**
  
  
-Should be compatible with any mod that doesn't change imagespaces and lighting templates, which means ambient light, fog, contrast, saturation, bloom, depth of field, etc.
  
  
**The ELFX Exteriors**
  
  
-It should be compatible with everything that doens't place an object over the light sources I placed. You can stick with LOOT load order.
  
  
**The ELFX Weathers**
  
  
-It should be compatible with any mod that doesn't change the weathers. It may be compatible with Climates of Tamriel, because it doesn't change the vanilla weathers, but I don't recommend it, because CoT has so much weathers that you may barely experience mine.
  
  
**Enhanced Ice**
  
  
-It should be compatible with any ice retexture and any mod that change the icebergs.
  
  
  
It should be compatible with any ENB setting, but I won't give any support to features that are changed by the ENB.
