# Lux - Fantabulous Lighting Templates and Patches

This mod will provide an add on for Lux that adds and distributes new custom lighting templates.  These are disturbed selectively to areas that makes sense and the in game difference should be subtle.  These are intended to compliment the theme of the location and the dominate light sources.
  
  
I also have created new patches and patch replacers that distribute Lux lighting templates and image spaces to mod added locations.   Some of these locations use the default Lux templates, while others will use the new custom lighting templates.
  
  
Currently most patches are just image space and lighting templates; it does not adjust light placement with the exception of patches where it is stated specifically.  Should be ok with any brightness template for Lux.
  
  
Feedback is much appreciated.
