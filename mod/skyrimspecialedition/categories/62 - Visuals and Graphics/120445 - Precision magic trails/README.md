**Description:﻿﻿**
  
This mod will add more spectacular precision based trails for enchanted weapons and artifacts. This thing were designed to work with more balanced animations, so if you use anime 360 degree per frame moveset, trail particles will be drawn rarely and overall picture won't be so good.
  
The more feedback you will give me, the better these trails could become. I'm not a VFX artist, just learning, so be gentle with me.
  
As inspiration visit me, i will add more stuff here.
  
Whole thing were tested with [Climates of Tamriel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2237) and [PI-CHO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35082?tab=files) ENB. Each climate mod and ENB has it's own colour correction, so you could get different picture.

The only way my trails won't work for you, is when trail data annotated inside an animation.
