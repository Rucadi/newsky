The Paralyze spell effects on your hand, especially Mass Paralysis, may have some weird artifacts around the swirls and edges, which normally isn't really visible. With some ENB setup like mine ([Silent Horizons 2 - Universal Core](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99398)), the issue may become much more apparent and jarring. I tried to fix it for myself, and thought others may make use of it.
  
**FEATURES**
  

  
* Very small tweak to the alpha channel of ﻿gradparalyze01.dds to avoid some of the pixelization and choppiness seen in my graphics setup.
See screenshot comparisons to compare the before (vanilla) and after (my mod).
  

**INSTALLATION**

  
* Download and install ﻿with your preferred mod manager.

  
**COMPATIBILITY**
  

  
* This mod is incompatible with any mods making changes to**gradparalyze01**.
My mod uses Glorious Gradients as a base, so let mine overwrite theirs.
