# Cathedral - 3D Lavender

A performance friendly 3D replacer for the dreaded lavender plant. This mod has a higher polygon count than the vanilla lavender plant (which was strictly 2D billboards and therefore extremely low), but it is within the realm of other vanilla plants and should not adversely affect performance..
