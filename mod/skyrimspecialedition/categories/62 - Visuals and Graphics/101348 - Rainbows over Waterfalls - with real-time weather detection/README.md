# Rainbows over Waterfalls - with real-time weather detection
- Author: Mharlek1

Whole map and DLCs covered.

  
New Gen - As of version **1.6** - a new script has been added -  introducing support for real-time weather detection (any weather mod)
  
  
This script will make sure the rainbows trigger on weather changes also by excluding snowy weathers. For this there is a common daytime schedule across the map sometime between 9-17h for them to trigger (rather than being strict to the schedule all the time). This should make rainbows more dynamic than the previous static version.
  
Comes with new requirements, such as skse and papyrus extender.
  
  
  
Older version 1.5.1
  

?? Schedule and options
  
morning -  from 9am to 12am
  
afternoon - from 2pm to 5pm
  
-
  
Dlcs and Markarth schedule
  
daytime - 9am to 5pm

  
Weather mods with early winter nighttime at 5pm may or may not need adjustment for consistency. Nonetheless its fine.
  
  
The rainbows will show up in the morning on the western regions of Skyrim and in the afternoon on the eastern regions. Middle gets a compromise with more hours.
  
There is an option for the same daytime schedule regardless of the region they are in.
  
Dawnguard Solstheim get all daytime because lesser time is spent there.. Places like Markarth will be the same

Feedback is the best thing you could give.
  
Depending on the weather the strenght and colors change. Most likely you don´t need the fainter textures. The colors are subdued pending the weather. The file is there nonetheless.
  
  
Standalone addons
  
  
**Interiors addon** **-** Some interiors have large waterfalls and/or groves with exterior light exposure. Rainbows in these conditions only.
  
                               Some  with custom made rainbow textures to mimic starlight - always present, no schedule. 
  
                               p.e. Blackreach, Eldergleam Sanctuary, etc
  
                                                    
  
**Rainbows over Player Homes** **-** A rainbow over your house.
  
                                                       Once you buy a certain decoration for a house, a chain, a lever or a button, an activator, will appear on the house walls                                                                         outside for you to toggle a rainbow hovering your new home. On/off feature. Off by default. 
  
                                                       Hearthfires homes not included. AE player homes not included. Always present; they do not follow a schedule.
  
  
**Solitude Loompa Land****-** A sample. Very high on sugar. Maybe you want more? 
  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
No requirements. Espfe´d, esl-esp.
  
This mod is subtle and pretty. and.. that´s about it. 
  
Rainy weathers custom activation things like that, I won´t do it.
  
Not interested in doing the same for the worldspace. There are limitations to the meshes. If you want to expand for bigger ones use the smoothie mesh.
  
  
You can expand this to other mods/worldpsaces if you want, p.e. Bruma
  
  
It is not impossible that some of the rainbows positioning is not perfect". Tell me how it is so if you want, and it will be addressed.
  
  
**Compatibility ✅**
  
**Recommended use with an enb** - no enb is fine too - the foam and spray particles in enbs are much more denser which make rainbows appear have more sense. Nonetheless, the mod is at its best using one.
  
[Water Effects Brightness and Reflection Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63862/) 
  
[Water for Enb](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37061/) - recommended - contains **big improvements for waterfalls**; mist blasts, foams, smooth slopes, etc. Use with enb or not.
  
TMD Epic Waterfalls should be compatible by default
  
Landscape fixes mod - don´t know 
  
Elfx/shadows
  
[Lux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43158/) - patch provided
  
Fits a dark-themed modlist: fall for a brief period of time to a tranquil experience of colorful bliss.
  
[Natural Waterfalls](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/87261/) - patch provided
  
Nothing to patch.
  
BS Bruma addon - does not touch Bs Bruma, adds a file which requires the mod
  
Falls of Ivarstead addon
  
  
The mod **natural waterfalls is compatible**. Although, it repositions a lot including water foams/sprays that are lessened..
  
Keep in mind Rainbows over waterfalls was not made with Natural Waterfalls in mind. **There is a patch available for it**, although there still may be adjustments to be made. p.e. rainbows do not show if behind foam, or flicker if intermeshing it. Or out of place, larger than they should, etc.
  
  
Initially I had tighter schedules but it was not worth it imo.
  
  
The scripts are very plain and very basic. They are active once a day in a split second only. To put this in perspective, if you pull a game lever once a day you get maybe the same script action as this. Maybe that´s not right. 
  
  
I have only tried this with vanilla weather and Azurite weather 2; no enb and pi-cho enb.
  
  
limitations and general information Spoiler
  
They pop in/out of existence in a split second on/off - not that noticeable, even more so since they are semi-transparent.
  
Under only certain rainy weathers or even some clear weathers, not all, when facing directly you may or may not see a faint halo above them. This is less than likely to be visible with an enb. Also this may be only for the very large rainbows which are rare/non-existant in this mod. Let me know.
  
The reach region is ripe with waterfalls. This mod should make the region more enjoyable to traverse. Provided you do morning strolls.
