This Bestiary patch for the amazing [dac0da](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/134405) by [Vicn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3863233)  mod covers these creatures:
  

  
* dwarven warrior/worker
atmoran bear
  
  
* sload and it's variants
yaghra with variants
  
  
* apocryphal creatures (like benthic variants of hunter and hounds)
gloving hushed and reaver
  
  
* wood Wraith (man-thing subvariant)
goldborn (common group for all gold variants)
  
  
* dragoman
flesh husk and stalker
  
  

  
biggest thanks to [Vicn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3863233)for the wonderful feast that is dac0da - I don't think I need to encourage anyone to go to the other parts (Vigilant Glenmoril and Unslaad).
  
[JPSteel2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/19519279) for this great bestiary framework - This accessory has found its way into a lot of collections and modlists, including my own.
