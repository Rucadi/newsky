I had a dream one day... I was in skyrim with my beloved better dynamic snow 2.11 and I was walking around skyrim. I had everything paralaxxed and it all worked without any patches. It was an incredibly beautiful dream. Then I suddenly woke up and the mod appeared inside my computer as if by magic (damn vaccines and their side effects).
  
  
Getting serious, my initial goal was to create a replacer of [BDS 2.11](https://www.nexusmods.com/Core/Libs/Common/Widgets/DownloadPopUp?id=137290&game_id=1704) (the only version that works with parallax) in such a way as to make it active by default without the need for any patches. You can't imagine my surprise when I discovered that essentially BDS was basically an extreme compatible mod, since it uses vanilla values ​​for coloring and overlaying. It's probably the most compatible mod of all at the moment. It doesn't even require BDS assets theoretically, it works with everything that use vanilla assets.

* [font=Arial]In the first release the mod was practically identical in appearance and settings to the original by [original mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50755) but without all [font=Arial][size=3] those [/font]incompatibility.[/size][/font]
[font=Arial]Supports parallax on most meshes by default.[/font]
  
* [font=Arial]Applies the snow shader to objects that normally cannot have it (e.g. FORNITURE, CONTAINERS, DOORS, etc.). No other mod can do this.[/font]
[font=Arial]Respect things as they were done in vanilla,starting from the coloring and the way of distribution.[/font]
  
* [font=Arial]From now on an active support and updating when needed (the mod is almost perfect in this way honestly).[/font]

[font=Arial]
  
Basically compatible with everything, this mod doesn't need any patches. If you are using the old patches you can uninstall them. If you are mid game, and don't feel like learning how to use [Re-Saver tool](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5031/), I have created a version with the same version as BDS 2.11 but I won't continue to keep it updated. The only version I intend to continue developing is the new one, with a new name to avoid misunderstandings: this mod does not require any old patch made for BDS 2.11. **This mod is also compatible with all assets made for Simplicity of Snow** **![](https://www.nexusmods.com/assets/images/emoticons/dark/wink.gif) so you can choose to use them without compatibility issues if you like them.**

* [font=Arial]Install this like a plugin into YourSkyrimFolder/data if you don't use a software as manager. If you use a manager you don't need advice. [/font]

  
* [font=Arial]If I had to choose I'd opt to keep it at the bottom of the LO.[/font]
