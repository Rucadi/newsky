# Nature of the Wild Lands 3.14 - 3D hybrid LODs and regions addon
- Author: Ylikollikas and fxxkthisworld
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

**Updated for NotW 3.12 and above.**
  
  
Resources for generating 3D hybrid LOD with DynDOLOD 3 Alpha. Resources for 299 trees included in total; ones which are not already covered by the main page. Some of the smaller shrubs and saplings were skipped for performance reasons. Supports seasons.
  
  
Additionally includes an optional regions addon for expanding the NotW tree diversity in Haafingar and Eastmarch regions. Haafingar now has more spruce trees, along with other species in the mix and Eastmarch has more broadleaf trees, such as oaks and elms.
  
  
I re-opened the comments here, because some of you were bothering the original author on his page about these, *sigh*.
