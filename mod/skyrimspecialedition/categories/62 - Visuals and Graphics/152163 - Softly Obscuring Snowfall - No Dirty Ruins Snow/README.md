# Softly Obscuring Snowfall - No Dirty Ruins Snow

A lot of meshes in Skyrim have shading "built in" to their vertex colors to emphasize details or provide a cheap alternative to actual occlusion shadowing.  This is generally fine on the normal objects, but dynamic snow takes on the underlying colors as well.  Once you realize what you're looking at with ugly brown snow on the end of ruin blocks, you won't be able to unsee it.
  
  
This mod repaths snow statics to new meshes that have vertex colors removed or adjusted to minimize this effect and give you a nice clean snow look.  Based on vanilla, SMIM, or Assorted Mesh Fixes where possible.
