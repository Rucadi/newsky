Skyrim is a windy place but there is no signs of any strong winds in Skyrim except for the blowing wind sounds that occurs at times.
  
   
**Skyrim Is Windy** is a mod made from scratch that will improve your immersion in Skyrim by making flora such as plants, grass, bushes and trees to animate and react to winds.
  
It covers every asset for every DLC. Including trees/plants/grass and bushes on Solstheim island.
