**FAQ:**
  
  
***How do I install this ?***
  
Unzip meshes folder into Skyrim/data/meshes and unzip textures folder into Skyrim/data/textures folder.
  
  
Overwrite ALL the files that you get asked to.
  
  
Or use any installer/mod manager 
  
  
***Can i easily uninstall this mod without harming anything ?***
  
  
Yes. Simply delete all the meshes and textures which were installed as part of this mod and everything will be reset with absolutely no harm done.
  
  
***Do i need to optimize the meshes*** ***?***Please, no, just no
  
  
***I get asked to overwrite SMIM files, what do I do ?***Overwrite them, this mod replicates the changes that SMIM did and adds more, so you will not be missing out on anything.
  
  
***Performance ?***Yes and no. The meshes have been optimized so they aren't stupid high poly and there aren't too many of them in any given scene, plus SSE handles more complex geometry really well, but this is an eye-candy mod, treat it as such.
