Markarth Mossy AF is simply making Markarth a ~~bit~~ lot more ancient and derelict. I started making the water area of Markarth entrance greenier in Markarth Outskirts, now it's Markarth inner city turn !

- Main mod and all patches are ESPFE so do not count toward the mod limit, it's a lightweight visual overhaul.
  
- Most assets have been replaced with a mossy counterpart, all vanilla building and meshes are left untouched so the mod won't change a single thing about all other assets being used in modded content in Markarth or anywhere else.
  
- I'm using a moss shader compatible with parallax and just like with Markarth Outskirts it's relying on vanilla Reach moss landscape texture. Final look may thus depend on each one own texture set.
  
- Moss is more important around the docks, water area tends to be mossier, entrance is less mossy.
  
- Most vanilla vegetation has been reworked. I cleaned a lot the whole city from vanilla shrubs and weird trees, I focused on ground one instead of spamming shrubs high in the mountains and optimized tree scale and placements. Feel free to use a tree overhaul there like Blubbo's and overwrite my own changes.
  
- Mod is fully compatible with all mesh replacers just like my own Markarth Fixed AF. I'm not editing meshes at all, only adding moss to them.
  
- I also reworked a few areas, adding a bit of clutter when it was making sense without overdoing it.
  
- I'm only relying on vanilla trees and plants so each one own set is important.
  
- Custom vine assets have been added so they feel a bit more unique and aren't purely relying on vertex colours like vanilla ones. 
  
- I removed all hanging moss on trees especially in the JK's Skyrim patch so tree replacers aren't wrecking havok and making them float all around.

All changes are made through a single plugin. It should be compatible with most mods, at least those that aren't editing buildings with a plugin. 
  
None of my assets should conflict with any mod, they're only doing their own stuff in there, nothing else. Shaders and vines are standalone.
  
  
Only Markarth inner city has been edited, I'm not editing anything else, no interior building, no Markarth exterior entrance, no dungeon.
  
  
I added a patch for JK's Skyrim cause I'm using it and it was already making the dock area a bit wilder, I would recommend using both mods cause it makes the whole city even greenier.
  
  
I also added two patches for Nature of the Wild Lands cause the new tree models have completely different scales and needed to be adjusted accordingly. I patched it for both vanilla and JK's Markarth. I'm not adding anything from NotWL, only tweaking vanilla trees refs, pine and reach trees.

I made it as compatible as possible with most overhauls. Any mod adding new assets, buildings or clutter may not any moss on them though, so this kind of mods will need a patch if you want to keep the whole area as mossy as possible. All new refs will need to be replaced with a mossy counterpart.
  
  
Mod is fully compatible tree overhauls, just overwrite mine if you want to keep the new tree layout.
  
It's also fully compatible with any mesh replacer. I'm not editing any vanilla mesh.
