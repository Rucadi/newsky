Like Skyland? LIke trees? Want them to better match and have the same high quality visuals that Skyland is known for? Are you one of the ones that keeps asking me to make Skyland trees, grass, and/or flora?
  
  
Well here's the answer!
  
  
Skyland Happy Little Trees Bark offers you high quality 4k, real world scanned tree textures for a variety of arbori found throughout Skyrim.
  
  
From Ash trees to snow trees, pine trees to aspen, it's all covered. Dead trees and stumps? Yup. Chopping blocks and firewood? For shizzle. Rotten wood? Yupskis. It's all here. Even the tundra tree and reach tree. They look pretty nice and match the Skyland feel and aesthetics along with the tone and vibe of the whole series.
  
*(At this point, I'm just talking to take up space with marketing jargon. You can skip this and go look at the pictures and download the mod. Don't forget to endorse).*

**Features:**
  
All new 4k, 2k, and 1k textures for all the tree bark in the game including stumps, fallen trees, dead trees, ash, pine, and aspen. Firewood and chopping blocks are included too. Does NOT contain meshes or alters HLT meshes at all. If there are UV issues, seams etc, [please refer to the HLT mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50961).
  
  
**What This Ain't:**
  
Not upscaled textures. Not a new tree mod. Not a tree LOD mod. Covers only what's in the description.
  
  
**Requirements:**
  
[Oddly enough, Happy Little Trees](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50961)
  
**Install:**
  
Install with Vortex or MO2 or drop contents of zip into  your games data folder (if you're a masochist)
  
Place below Happy Little Trees. Can go above Skyland. Run pg patcher if you want the complex parallax effect on trees. If not, you can delete or disable the \_m textures.
  
  
**Uninstall:**
  
Exact revers of install instructions
  
  
**Compatibility:**
  
Everything as long as you have the requirements.
  
  
**Parallax:**
  
Maybe. I have all the generated height maps. I just didn't wanna go through the effort of converting tree meshes to parallax and testing and all that jazz. But never say never. I can. I just didn't. Because I'm lazy, and that's okay. You'll survive.
  
  
**Asking for forgiveness:**
  
To arborists, scientists, and general lovers of trees; I wholeheartedly apologize for not using the right bark on the trees. If you're looking for scientific accuracy in representing the types of trees found in Boreal forests based on their bark, this isn't the mod for you. I know, as I was making the mod, some people would complain that the pine trees may have a different version of pine bark than what would be found north or near the arctic circle. Same for the tundra and reach tree (of which I have no clue what trees they are representing). I got as close as I could.
  
But, alas, if you're looking for anything based in science and fact whilst playing a video game, maybe this one isn't the one for you. Just like you can't learn to be a doctor with Surgeon Simulator 2.
