Skyking Signs offers all new meshes and textures for the shop and inn signs found throughout Skyrim. Signs will sway in the wind and respond more accordingly when hit. Their materials are set to wood as opposed to metal like the vanilla meshes.
  
This mod has zero requirements and does not have an ESP file.

**[size=3][b]2.1 Changes**
  
[/b]

  
* Tweaked parallax textures to reduce distortion

**2.0 Changes**
  
[/size]

  
* Now includes complex parallax textures and meshes.
Now has a FOMOD installer.
  
* No requirements needed.

  
**Features:**
  
Dynamically sway in the wind. How much sway depends on your weather mod.
  
New meshes
  
New textures
  
Altered mesh mass for better dynamics and feel of weight
  
Altered mesh material to wood (from vanilla setting of metal) so arrow will stick in the signs now and make the right noise
  
  
**Install:**
  
Install normally with your mod manager or manually place in your games data folder (not recommended). Place after city overhaul mods. If you use any of the patches, you will have to run parallax gen. 
  
  
My parallax option ONLY covers parallax for the signs. The wooden posts holding them use whatever textures you have for cities and villages. If they do not have parallax textures, you will have glossy wood posts. I did it this way so that the wood posts match the architecture they are in and use the textures from your load order for consistency.
  
  
**How To Set Up Parallax:**
  
*Use these settings in ENBSeries.ini*
  
  
EnableTerrainParallax=false
  
EnableComplexParallax=true
  
EnableComplexParallaxShadows=true
  
EnableTerrainBlending=true
  
EnableComplexTerrainParallax=true
  
EnableComplexTerrainParallaxShadows=true
  
EnableComplexMaterial=false
  
  
**Compatibility:**
  
Not compatible with any mod that replaces meshes or retextures shop and inn signs.
  
Compatible with COTN and LOTD.
  
Blowing in the Wind and other mods to make signs move is not required nor compatible. If you use Blowing in the Wind for the lanterns, I suggest [Blowing in the Wind Lite](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61161)﻿.
  
  
**PERMS:**
  
I've uploaded blank sign diffuse textures for your use. You can use these to make patches, translations, or signs for your own mods that utilize Skyking Signs, and more. For perms, you can ***only include Skyking Sign diffuse textures*** in your mods. You cannot include any Skyking Sign meshes or normal maps. This mod must be required for your mod. Credits must appear on your description page for your mod.
  
**Special Thanks:**
  
To everyone in the streams during the development of this mod and those in our discord that tested the mod for me.
