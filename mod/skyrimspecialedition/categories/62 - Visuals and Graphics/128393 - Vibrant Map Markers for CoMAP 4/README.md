I really like having colored map markers and CoMAP is something I wouldn't want to play without so I was waiting for an update to Vibrant Map Markers. Noticing how long it has been since any of the colored map markers authors have been online, I decided to do it myself.
  
  
Note: I am a software engineer, not an artist. This is my first time working with vector graphics so there might be issues. None that I've noticed in my gameplay though.
  
  
I'm happy with how the markers look, but if anyone more art inclined has suggestions on how any of them could be changed I would consider it.
