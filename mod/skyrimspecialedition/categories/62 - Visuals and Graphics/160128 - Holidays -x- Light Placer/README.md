**?FEATURES**
  
  
?Subtle lights.
  
?Unsynched pulsing for each reference.
  
?Lantern light colours depend on their fabric.
  
?Only a Light Placer json; no more, no less.
  
  
As you may have noticed, as of v1.4.0, Community Shaders dropped support for ENB particle lights. I had some mods in my load order that still used that facilitation; so instead of waiting for someone to do it or weeping silently, I decided to learn how Light Placer configs work and did my own mod.
  
  
Heavily inspired by monkeyangie's "[Holidays - Original Lanterns ENB Light](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/83230)" and "[Holidays - Pumpkins ENB Light](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78496)". Tried to do the lights more subtle than theirs. Pulsing animation start time is randomised! Oh, and now, each lantern emits in its fabrics colour, thanks to the amazing Light Placer. See the screenshots!
  
  
  
**?COMPATIBILITY**
  
  
❌Lights were added to node names in the mesh for better precision on animations. If you have a model replacer for Holidays, it may cause compatibility problems. Not aware of any mod that does that.
  
❌Other mods adding ENB or Light Placer lights for the same meshes.
  
✅Anything else.
