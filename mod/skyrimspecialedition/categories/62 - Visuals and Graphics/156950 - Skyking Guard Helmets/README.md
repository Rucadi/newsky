A refresh of the guard helmets in Skyrim featuring all new textures, environmental reflections, and cubemaps.**[/size]
  
I love a lot of the guard armor mods here on nexus. What I didn't like was that there wasn't many or any mods that retextured their helmets. Sure, you can find mods that replace the helmets, but I wasn't very keen on the designs of them. I like the vanilla helmets. I just wanted to new, high quality textures for them. So I made this mod. I hope you enjoy it.**Install:** Install with your mod manager and place after armor mods that retextures or replace the meshes for guard helmets.
  
  
**NOTE:** If you want less gloss/reflections, simply delete or turn off the included esp file. 
  
  
**Compatibility:** Compatible with any mod as long as this mod wins any conflicts for guard helmets. Looks great with a variety of guard armor overhaul mods.
  
  
**Author's  Note:**
  
I like to pair this mod with either [Xavbio's Guard Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98115) or [Lollygaggin'](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/117833). Two, I feel lore friendly texture and mesh overhauls for the guard armor. If you pair this mod with Xavbio's Guard Armor, I like to disable the ESP file included with this mod to remove the gloss and reflections from the helmet.
