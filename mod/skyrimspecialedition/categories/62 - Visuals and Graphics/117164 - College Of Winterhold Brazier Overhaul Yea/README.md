I wanted to add an extra touch to the UCOW and I found the mod [Winterhold Brazier](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72646), but I wasn't satisfied by the overhaul designed, even though I liked the cage a lot.
  
  
And thanks to the very kind mod author [Lanif79](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/49633331), I crafted my own replacer using his model with a custom icy metal texture, which fit well in the college imo
  
  
I added them only in the courtyard, around the doors, and not everywhere, to add an extra touch of meaning
