Hey, do you like waves, do you like Skyrim, do you wish Skyrim had better waves? Well now it does!Enjoy GKB Waves; Adds new wave models and textures to the coast of Skyrim from the edge of the playable area up to Solitude. Waves are new models (not Dragonborn waves). These use animated textures and minimal polygons. This has been designed to have minimal effect on fps. The mod shouldn't effect any vanilla assets so it should be compatible with everything unless the mod you are using edits the terrain of the coast.
  
  
Textures originally from textures.com, images have been heavily modified to create new textures and all alpha maps are made from scratch.
  
  
Future versions will add waves from Solitude onwards, and waves to islands.
  
In regards to permissions for the PC release, you can use these models and textures provided they are on a new landscape, or to a new area added to Skyrim, as I intend to add waves to the rest of vanilla Skyrim where they make sense.

Hope you enjoy.
  
  
NOTE: Big thanks to TechAngel85 for updating Realistic Waves Two to work with GKB Waves. You guys shouldn't have any compatibility issues now :)
