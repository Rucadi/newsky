Makes the falling petals last longer.
  
  
I adore the [Falling Gildergreen Petals](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21426?tab=description) mod and someone asked in the post section about making the petals last longer. They were linked to the [Petals Fall Down](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/94894) mod by markdf for LE. (If you end up liking this mod, hop on over and give markdf an endorsement for his eh? Obviously he thought of it first!)[left]
  
This is a mesh file only. No esp. Feel free to try it out and see if you like it. If it doesn't do anything for you just delete and continue on your merry way. :)  (I find they're easier to see at a distance during the night and your depth of field settings may also impact their look).
  
  
Reason I ported it:
  
  
I know some folk are leery of using LE assets in their SE game. And for people just starting out it can be difficult to know what is Safe to use without breaking things. So, I dug around to see if anyone had ported it and when I couldn't find it I poked around on the Petals Fall Down mod page and found the following. So, open permission to port and directions on how to do so! Interestingly enough the part of the .nif file I needed to change is different on the SE version vs the LE version. Fun times. ^\_^    (And I will of course remove this should markdf decide he wants his own port/revamp ^\_^)[/left]

P.S. If you're using Gildergreen Regrown there is a patch in the posts on the Falling Gildergreen Petals page to make it work with the
  
different stages of the sapling growth.
  
  
  
  
P.P.S. I may play with it more, until I get it exactly to my tastes.
