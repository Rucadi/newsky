A simple mini-mod that adds visual smoke effect to torches used by the player and the NPCs as well as the wall-mounted torches + a companion mod that adds floating smoke effect to most of the candles.
  
  
Please don't argue that in real life a fully lit torch doesn't really give off smoke; I'm well aware of it, however, I feel the smoke effect gives a nice visual punch and enhances immersion. Other than that, a majority of the fire sources in Skyrim already give off smoke to the extent that most of the brave Nords should have already perished from carbon monoxide poisoning, unless of course the hordes of bandits roaming the lands got them first. So frankly, who cares.
  
  
The framerate hit should be negligible to moderate depending on your system specifications. The amount of concurrent on-screen particles in Skyrim is governed by iMaxDesired parameter in SkyrimPrefs.ini, and in case the maximum defined number is exceeded, the game will dynamically reduce the particle count, helping with the performance. There's also the caveat: in case there are too many on-screen particles, you might notice that some effects disappear especially when further away no matter how beefy rig you're using.
  
  
The mod is not compatible with anything that modifies the same meshes unless otherwise specified.
  
  
A note to mod authors: this mod uses addon node indices in the range of 121-125.
  
  
To install, use a mod organizer or copy the included files to your Skyrim/Data folder.
  
  
To uninstall, simply delete the files manually or via a mod organizer.
