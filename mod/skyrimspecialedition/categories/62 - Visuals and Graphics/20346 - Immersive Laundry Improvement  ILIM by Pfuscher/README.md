I always wondered why the mod is so performance heavy for its low res textures.
  
  
The original Mod uses the wrong formats for textures and has mistakes in his meshes.

1. Resaved everything correctly -> Saving half the Vram on 80% of files.
  
2. Deleted not working specular maps -> Saving even more Vram.
  
3. Added cubemaps to metal parts. -> low cost better visuals.
  
  
Summary: Better looks and less Vram, no kidding.
  
  
Just overwrite the original files with mine.
