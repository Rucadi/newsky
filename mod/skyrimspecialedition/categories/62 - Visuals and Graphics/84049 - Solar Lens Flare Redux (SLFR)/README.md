**Planned Updates:**
  
  

  
* Support for popular weather mods
A variety of lens flare styles
  
* FOMOD Installer

  
**Installation:**

  
1. Download and install the ***SLFR - Flare Effect*** file that corresponds to the flare effect you find appealing.
Download and install the ***SLFR - Weathers*** file that corresponds to your weather mod.
  
2. See load order notes below.

**Load Order:**
  
  
SLFR overrides/patches the WTHR forms of the weather mod to which SLFR is tailored.  Therefore, SLFR must load AFTER the weather mod to which it is tailored.
  
  
Load Order Example:
  
  

  
* Cathedral Weathers.esp
SLFR - Flare Effect.esp
  
* SLFR - Cathedral Weathers.esp

  
**FAQ:**Q: What if I don't give a damn and hate solar lens flares with a burning passion?
  
A: There's the door. ----->
  
  
Q: What does "to which SLFR is tailored" mean?
  
A: It means that SLFR must be made specifically for a particular weather mod to avoid overriding the lighting and other effects that the weather mod provides.
  
  
Q: Can you make SLFR for my favorite weather mod?
  
A: I will be working to include support for the most popular weather mods.  If you find that your favorite weather mod is not supported please post a reply to the "Wishlist" forum topic and it will be considered.
  
  
**Compatibility:**
  
  

  
* TLDR; Your mileage may vary if your use SLFR along with other patches to your weather mod.  Read on to learn more.
SLFR is a patch for weather mods and ***MAY NOT BE COMPATIBLE*** with other patches made for the same weather mod that SLFR patches.  If both SLFR and the weather mod patch modify the same WTHR forms then one will override the other depending on your load order.  If you desire the lens flare effect that SLFR adds you must load it ***AFTER*** other weather mod patches.  You have been warned.
  
* SLFR is compatible with ENB.  However, if your ENB preset adds a lens flare effect to light sources using ENBLENS.FX, SLFR will likely interfere with the ENB lens flare when viewing Magnus; SLFR's lens flare effect is only rendered when viewing Magnus.
