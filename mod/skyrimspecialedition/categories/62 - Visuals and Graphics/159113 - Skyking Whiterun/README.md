**Installation and Compatibility:**
  
Download and place in your textures/meshes section. If you use mods to fix Whiterun building or trellis meshes, you can place this before or after those mods, it doesn't matter.
  
  
Compatible with any Whiterun decorating mod like City Trees, JK, etc...
  
  
**Parallax:**
  
When installing this mod, select the parallax option and then run Parallax Gen. Ensure your ENB is set up correctly to enable complex parallax. This mod and it's comment section is not a help section or guide on setting up parallax. This mod assumes you already have parallax set up or know how to do it.
  
  
**What this mod doesn't do:**
  
This mod doesn't decorate Whiterun or place any clutter, flora, or trees. It doesn't effect weather. It doesn't effect NPCs. This mod ONLY retextures Whiterun and replaces a handful of meshes to fix their vanilla errors. This mod has been thoroughly tested by various users and is bug free. Any comments mentioning issues that this mod has zero impact on will be ignored, especially since this mod has no ESP file.
