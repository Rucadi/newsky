# Cat's Nessa Replacers (and a preset)
- Author: CatOfEvilGenius

**IMPORTANT!** This replacer is out of date! It was for Nessa 1.0 but I need to update it for Nessa 1.11. I will do that eventually...
  
  
  
Enjoy this high poly head replacer for Craftian's intriguing [Nessa](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77337) follower! One face with several hair options (fomod installer). No dependencies, everything is included in the replacer! I also made a Nessa preset so YOU can look like my Nessa (see instructions below). Post your pictures if you like my work!
  
  
  
**Installation (Nessa Follower Replacer)**
  
  
The replacer requires the [Nessa](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77337) follower but no other mods.
  
The replacer does NOT require any hair/eye/brow mods, that's included.
  
The replacer does NOT require High Poly Head, that's included.
  
The replacer does NOT require any skin mods, it uses your skin.
  
  
If you have [Racial Skin Variance](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69160), be sure to select the RSV main file.
  
If you do NOT have Racial Skin Variance, select the No RSV main file.
  
  

  
* install Craftian's [Nessa](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77337) follower
install my Nessa replacer
  

  
  
**Installation  (Nessa Player Preset)**
  
  
The preset makes YOU look like Nessa. It does NOT require the Nessa follower but DOES require other mods.
  
  
If you have [Racial Skin Variance](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69160), get the RSV preset.
  
If you do NOT have Racial Skin Variance, get the No RSV preset.

The preset does NOT come with fancy hair, just shaved Redguard hair.
  
If you want fancy hair like in the pictures, get some hair mods.
  
Want to know which hair I used? See 2nd sticky post and/or labels on pics.

**Picture Credits**
  
  
My Nessa is shown with [BnP Female Skin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65274) by swefrida. Your Nessa will have your installed skin.
  
  
I have [Cathedral Weathers and Seasons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24791). I do not use any ENB nor Reshade.
  
[Vanilla HDR](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76521) makes harsh outdoor lighting much softer.
