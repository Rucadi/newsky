UESP mentions in their notes of [Erandur](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Erandur):
  
  
> Despite being a self-proclaimed priest of Mara, Erandur will still invoke Azura's name in combat dialogue like any other Dunmer. Additionally, Erandur does have combat lines referencing Mara ("For Lady Mara!", etc.), but these lines are only heard during the Waking Nightmare quest. It is more likely leaving dialogue mentioning Azura out was an oversight during game development, as Erandur's demeanor when speaking of his devotion to Mara, as well as his mention of having set up a shrine to Mara in Nightcaller Temple, strongly implies he is telling the truth about his Divine conversion.

  
  
This mod aims to adress this, by disabling any generic Dark Elf dialogue and restoring the combat lines that are only used during his quest.
  
  
This mod should be fully compatible with [Denizens of Morthal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33965?).
  
  
**Dialogue lines disabled for Erandur**
  
  
Any Male Dark Elf lines that are sarcastic/snarky or involve the words "Nerevar", "Azura", "n'wah" and "fetcher".
  
  
Other Male Dark Elf NPCs will still use them.

**When healing him**
  

  
* Thank you, my child.

  
  
**Bleedout**
  

  
* Lady Mara... preserve me...
I've failed you... forgive me...

Lady Mara... I await your embrace...

Can't fail now... must hang on...
  

  
  
**Combat ends**
  

  
* So endeth the lesson.
To Oblivion with you.
  
* Forgive me, my brother.
Mara forgives you, my child.
  

  
  
**FAQ**
  
  
Q: Does installing/updating/uninstalling on an existing save work?
  
A: As far as I know, it should. However, it's good practice to keep a backup save prior to doing this, just in case.
  
  
Q: Is this compatible with <insert mod>?
  
A: I don't know by heart. You might need to check yourself.
  
  
Q: Will you make a patch for <insert mod>?
  
A: Only if it's a mod I use myself or plan on using, I have enough time and I actually like the idea. Otherwise, feel free to do it yourself. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: I have a suggestion to improve the mod. Can you do it?
  
A: Maybe, if I have time and I like the idea, I'll consider it.
  
  
Q: Will you port this to <insert platform>?
  
A: No, I myself only support the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If someone else wants to port it, feel free. (see permission) If you decide to port it, you yourself take full responsibility to offer support to said port. I will not provide no support for any ports by third parties.
  
  
Q: I use a ported version of this mod on <insert platform> and I have a problem. Can you help?
  
A: I don't provide any support for third party ports on other platforms than the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If you have issues, you should adress the person that ported it.
  
  
Q: Does this work on Skyrim 1.6+, aka "Anniversary Edition"?
  
A: Yes, it should.
  
  
Q: Why don't your mods use MCMs and instead use this janky console command system to set globals?
  
A: I am not a fan of MCMs. You can set the globals by making a patch in xEdit. I have no plans of changing this. If you want to add an MCM, feel free. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: Why don't you use FOMODs?
  
A: That would require reuploading the entire mod, in question, even if I only make a small change. My internet is limited and reuploading the files each time will take a huge chunk of my monthly volume.
