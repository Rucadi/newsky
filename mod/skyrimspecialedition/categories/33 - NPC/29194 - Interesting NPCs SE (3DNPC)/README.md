**Description**
  
  
Interesting NPCs is a project to add color and life to Skyrim through three-dimensional characters. Each NPC is integrated into the world, with a backstory and an extensive dialogue tree to explore. Many of these characters are fully voiced by a talented team of over 80 voice actors. The dialogue choices allow you to role-play, providing humor and depth to each conversation. You can be a jerk or a jester, a white knight or an assassin, as the most important character is you.
  
  
Originally, the goal was to expand 8 followers to include commentary on every quest and location in the game, including bonus conversations during or after major quest-lines. Currently, these followers, whom are dubbed "Super Followers" because they fly and wear capes, have approximately 1000+ lines each. It may be unrealistic to meet this goal, however, as actor interest in performing slave labor can ebb and flow, and even a dozen new lines can often take months to get recorded.

**Features**
  
Spoiler
  

  
* 250+ Voiced NPCs
50+ Quests
  
* 25+ Followers with Location Based Commentary
15+ Marriage NPCs
  
* For better control of which NPCs are in your game, non Quest-NPCs can have their base dialogue removed via "setstage DialogueNPCNAME 500" console command. Some quests have different names like "KavaldDialogue," so if it doesn't work type "HELP NPCname" in the console to find the appropriate quest name. This will turn them into vanilla clutter.
Unvoiced/Unfinished Dialogue can be enabled via the console by "setstage 3dnpcenable 1"
  

  
This video highlights just a small portion of the features in this mod, including voice acting, followers with unique commentary, interconnected NPCs, unexpected encounters, bard music, and player role playing choices. This represents just a fraction of the overall content in Interesting NPCs.

> **Quests Prerequisites**
>   
> Many quests expand on existing NPCs, and work under the presumption that you have met them. If I knew how to make quests from the beginning, I obviously would have tried to introduce more NPCs as part of a quest. Nevertheless, even now there are factors that force me to use prerequisites. Often times vanilla dungeons or quests have to be cleared to ensure no conflicts. The [official wiki](http://3dnpc.com/quests/) lists the requirement to start each quest."

**Compatibility**
  
Spoiler
  
Mods that make very extensive edits to vanilla interiors and exteriors in the towns and cities (as in, rearranges them a lot) are bound to be at severe odds with INPC. This includes most town and city overhauls especially if they also edit the vanilla inns. Exterior edits to these same locations will play along to a certain degree. INPC uses some vanilla objects such as furniture and if these are disabled or moved by the other mod, you can expect some minor or not so minor issues.
  
- INPC places buildings in a few locations, which may overlap with another mod using the same location.
  
- Big game-play overhauls (SkyRe, Requiem, ect.) should be fine, with the only issue being that INPCs and some quest rewards might be nerfed without a patch.
  
- While they edit interiors, lighting/weather overhauls such as Climates of Tamriel, Realistic Lighting Overhaul, ELFX etc will be compatible. So will weather-only mods and most other stuff relating to environment makeovers
  
- Skill or actor overhauls such as mods remaking smithing, archery, dragons, combat etc. are compatible. INPC does not edit anything relating to game-play.
  
- New world-spaces like Falskaar will not conflict at all
  
- If you're using My Home is Your Home (MHYH) don't set a home for your INPC follower until you have completed all quests involving them. To find out which quests are associated to your follower, please visit [3dnpc.com](http://3dnpc.com/).
  
- If you're using Hunterborn, you'll need to turn on manual looting during the quest "[The Way to a Big Oaf’s Heart](http://3dnpc.com/wiki/interesting-npcs/quests/full-quests/the-way-to-a-big-oafs-heart/)," prior to killing Tusky.
  
- There are currently some conflicts with water mods when used with a Wrye Bash, which causes missing cells (square chunks) of water. Unchecking "Import Cells" when generating a bashed patch is confirmed to fix it.
  
  
Additionally, you might have opened 3dnpc in TES5Edit and seen it has some leveled lists. Note that these lists are specific to and used exclusively by INPC and are not intended for distribution among other NPCs in Skyrim. In other words, vanilla leveled lists are NOT edited by this mod, so there is no need to include INPC in your bashed patch.

**Installation**
  
Spoiler
  
**Manual installation and NMM are unsupported.**
  
Don't act simple and blame the port because you borked your game trying to install something manually. If you must do it manually, use the BSA version. Install through your mod manager of choice. NMM is also notorious for failing to install larger archives. You shouldn't be using most [EOL](https://endoflife.software/what-is-eol) software regardless. 
  
  
I'd suggest [ModOrganizer 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194) (my go-to) or something with similar VFS system (i.e. [Kortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/90868/) seems okay). [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) works well enough too. If your download interrupts, try the Google Drive mirrors ("Mirrors" at the top of the Description tab). You'll need a new game to ensure things work as intended.
  
  
Load order of INPC stuff should look something like this:
  
 ﻿1. **3DNPC.esp** (base mod's ESP itself)
  
 ﻿2. [For BSA Users] **[b]3DNPC0.esp** [/b](dummy plugin that loads the second BSA)
  
 ﻿3. Any optional INPC patches you chose.
  
 ﻿4. Any mods that you wish to have take priority over INPC.
  
  
  
  
**Updating**
  
Spoiler
  
**MANUAL**: Install a mod manager.
  
**MOD MANAGERS**: Load the update file under the main file.
  
Note: If you prefer to "Merge" into the main mod, be careful not to accidentally click "Replace" (and yes we've all done it once).
  
  
Sometimes we'll have a full update where we merge the update into the main file. However! If you don't want to redownload the entire mod, I try to keep the Mirrors section (top of Description) updated when I have the time. Here's what you can do:
  

  
1. Check if the update file version and Nexus version are the same number
If they are, download the 4.0 to 4.X hotfix.
  
2. Install and load below the previous main file as per usual updates.
  
  
  
**Uninstalling**
  
Spoiler
  
The mod should be safe to uninstall via mod manager or simple deletion of the esp, BSA and loose files such as the sound folders and textures such as the Mogo's Mead labels. The mod is at its heart extremely simple, the size is mostly due to audio files. As with all mods, some things may linger in your save.
  
  
Starfis has also provided this handy list of things to do when uninstalling:
  

  
1. Dismiss all followers from this mod if you have any
Go to a location without any NPCs
  
2. Make a save to a new slot (just to be sure, if something goes wrong), and uninstall the mod through your mod manager.
Possibly recreate all your patches like Bashed patch, Merged patch, ect., so any of these ESPs which could be dependent on this file can't cause any problems, or CTDs.
