**Overview
  
  
Ashlander Nomads Names** is a [NND](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73081)-based mod that provides names for some Dunmers that inhabit Solstheim. It is some sort of an expansion to [Tamrielic Names](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73153) and adds an additional layer of lore details.
  
  
Similarly to [Tamrielic Names](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73153)  it draws information from [Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Names)﻿ to be true to the lore.
  
  
> ﻿*Ashlander culture is the remains of the ancestor-worshipping tribal culture which the House Dunmer left behind.*

The main Solstheim's population is Dunmers. As such [Tamrielic Names](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73153) will give them traditional Dunmeri names. **[b]Ashlander Nomads Names**[/b] will give some unnamed Dunmers from Solstheim alternative names that are specific to [Ashlanders](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Ashlanders)﻿ culture.
  
  
  
**Details**
  
  
While according to the lore [Ashlanders](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Ashlanders)﻿ aren't directly related to Solstheim, I took the liberty to interpret some facts to give a reason for this mod to exist:
  
  
Dunmers that you meet in Solstheim are refugees from destroyed [Ald'ruhn](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Ald%27ruhn) and probably other Dunmer cities in Morrowind.
  
> *After the destruction of [Ald'ruhn](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Ald%27ruhn), [Great House Redoran](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:House_Redoran) sent an expedition group led by [Brara Morvayn](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Brara_Morvayn) to settle in Raven Rock. The [Dunmer](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dunmer) were welcomed to Raven Rock.*

  
And it is known that some Ashlanders move to cities from their nomads.
  
> The **Velothi** (named such after the prophet [Veloth](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Veloth)) are Ashlanders who have abandoned nomadic life and settled among the city Dunmer.

  
As such, seeing Velothi that found their new home on Solstheim isn't something extraordinary.
  
  
The mod comes with two variants:
  

  
* One that gives Ashlander names to all\* unnamed Dunmers in Solstheim.
The other gives Ashlander names to around\* 40% of unnamed Dunmers in Solstheim.
  

\* This doesn't include already named Dunmers, so there always will be Dunmers of House Redoran.
  
  
**[Ashlanders](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Ashlanders) in Skyrim**There is now an optional file that rarely distributes Ashlander names to Dunmers all around the Tamriel (and beyond).
  
  
> *It's reasonable that some Dunmers would continue to migrate to mainland Skyrim (and other lands from New Lands mods).*

Note that this file requires [Tamrielic Names](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73153) to correctly detect Dunmers (both Vanilla and mod-added).
  
  
  
P.S. These were fun mods to work on, as I had a chance to dive into the lore and explore rich TES universe.
