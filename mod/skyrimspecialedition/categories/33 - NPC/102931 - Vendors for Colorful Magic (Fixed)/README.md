DESCRIPTION

  
This mod allows you to buy Colorful Magic's amazing spells and items from their original vendors. No more reliance upon other mods like additemmenu. Buy your awesome artifacts of ancient power the old fashioned way, with gold!
  
  
In order to maximize compatibility, the most recent version of this mod has places these vendors inside their very own interior cell. It's in the hills between Riverwood and Whiterun. Simply cross the Riverwood bridge heading toward Whiterun, and continue traveling north. You'll see a portal on your right, just as the hill descends toward Whiterun. 
  
  
That's right, I've now brought over all the crafting stations, memorable npcs and shouting stones from the original mod.
  
  
Don't forget to check out the Golden Anvil. There's a special treat waiting for you on it.
  
  
Pastel offers a wide variety of Colorful Magic's spells. 
  
  
Conte offers  a wide variety of Colorful Magic's  weapons.
  
  
Please consult the F.A.Q. section below, before asking any questions in the POSTS section.

F.A.Q.

  
"Are these vendors compatible with my City Overhaul?"
  
- With the most recent update, the vendors have been moved into their own interior cell, so no more issues there.
  
  
"What about the Winterhold version of the original mod? I miss seeing these vendors in Winterhold!"
  
- Once I figured out how to build a interior cell for the vendors, I couldn't resist giving them their own place. Cramming the crafting stations, shouting stones and other amenities into Winterhold, which I'd then have to adjust for every City Overhaul, just wasn't worth it. There is a special treat waiting for you on the Golden Anvil however, to make this interior cell much more convenient for your playthrough...
  
  
"Will you be adding in other patches / mods to Colorful Magic?"
  
- Yes. My next goal is to bring in the bosses. I plan on continuing ConfusedEnoch's approach by making small, modular installments. We can combine them into a single mod later.
  
  
"Can you make Colorful Magic more 'Balanced', 'Immersive', insert-personal-taste-adjective-here?"
  
- My primary goal is to extract and polish as much of the original Colorful Magic mod as possible, without breaking anything in the process. Keep in mind, some people *like* how overpowered and un-immersive the original mod was. I will *eventually* add in my own 'immersive' and 'balanced' version, but that's *waaaay* down the road from now.
