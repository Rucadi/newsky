*Sinding will now have proper voice and sound effects while in Werewolf form, no longer using his normal immersion-breaking human voice when transformed into the menacing beast.
  
  
The reuse of Sinding's human voice even after he transformed into his massive and ferocious beast form caused many to lose the immersion and epicity of the "Ill Met by Moonlight" quest, and even not want to complete it again after finishing the quest for the first time. After all, the human voice does not match the creature he transforms into, not even representing the very change in personality he undergoes when transforming.
  
  
Well, that problem no longer exists, and this **completely .ESP free** mod is for you!*[/font][/left][left][/left][left][font=Times New Roman]
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/XwFuxsS.png)*﻿*- Overhaul of Sinding's voice when transformed into a Werewolf, including the addition of new sound effects, such as a "soul-piercing" howl at the beginning of dialogue;
  
  
- The quest *"Ill Met by Moonlight"* was not touched by this mod, so it is compatible with any mod, including those that modify the sounds of Werewolves, just being incompatible with mods that modify Sinding dialogs when transformed.
  
  
  
  
Known issues:
  
  
- Sinding when transformed has a sound bug duly documented in both *"Uesp"* and *"The Elder Scrolls Wiki"*, respectively: *"Talking to Sinding in Bloated Man's Grotto when he is not scripted to say anything will result in corrupt audio playing." (UESP) "Upon interacting with Sinding, instead of making any comments or werewolf growls, there is a strange static noise that is heard instead." (TES Wiki)*I documented the vanilla bug too in the video below, which, as mentioned, has nothing to do with this mod:
  
  
  
- If attacked from a distance during the initial dialogue on top of the stone, thus breaking the intended flow of the quest, he will react with human comments compatible with the voice type of his human form. This however is not a problem because you are not supposed to attack him at that moment. He shares his type voice with several other NPCs as a human, and at this point he still triggers those responses, which doesn't happen later when during the hunt;
  
  
- As I didn't want to edit the "*Ill Met by Moonlight*" quest and its scripts, to keep the mod compatible with others that do this, a concession had to be made. When not transformed, and even after doing so, Sinding uses the "malecommonaccented" voice. Skyrim has few voice actors, and several npcs share the same voices, even when they have unique dialogues. Most of Sinding's dialogue when human is unique, as well as when transformed, but some short lines are shared with other NPCS, and editing them, making them unique to Sinding, would require me to edit his quest, where the dialogues are included, and as I said, I don't intend to for compatibility reasons. Since pretty much everything is unique to him, despite sharing a voice type, it wasn't a problem to edit his lines when transformed into Werewolf, since only he uses them and no other NPC, except the line *"So be it."*, used when we tell him that we are going to kill him. This line is used by several NPCs, although rarely, so to avoid him using the normal voice after a long dialogue with the new voice, I decided to put a voice file of silence, since it is a fast line and that you practically do not notice. This causes any NPC who says *"So be it"* using that type of voice to also make no sound when saying it, but it's so fast and so rare that you won't even notice the difference. However, I left in the files, duly documented and separated, the option in which *"So be it"* uses the new Werewolf effects, but I don't recommend that you replace it because then any NPC that uses the phrase will sound like one, and I left it there the option also to go back to human *"So be it"*, but then Sinding will sound human when saying this. The ready-to-use version, as I mentioned, removes the *"So be it"* sound from this type of voice, but you can replace it with the other two options on the loose files, just copy and paste.

The mod is not compatible with other mods that modify the voice lines sound archives of Sinding. If you have one installed, or think you might have one, put this mod below it/them in your load order. If you are asked about files overwriting those of other mods, press "Yes to all".
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)
