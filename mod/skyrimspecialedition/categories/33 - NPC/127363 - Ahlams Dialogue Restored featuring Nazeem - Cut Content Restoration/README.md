**Details**
  
  
  
This mod restores four lines of previously cut dialogue for Ahlam, the wife of Nazeem in Whiterun, adding new layers to her character. The restored dialogue includes:
  
  

  
* **Temple Greetings:** When you encounter Ahlam in the Temple of Kynareth, she now has two unique greetings that were created from scratch with Artifical Intelligence (Only the transcript remained):
> "My dearest Nazeem is a very rich, very important man. His reflection tells him as much every morning."

  
* > "There are those, like my husband, who feel the war is a noble endeavor. Everything is noble from the safety of your own home."

  

  
* **Goodbye Dialogue in Temple:** After exhausting her temple dialogue, she will part with a new line:
  > "Take care of yourself."

  

  
* **Outside Interactions:** Ahlam’s usual, less friendly dialogue remains when you speak to her outside the Temple, but with a new goodbye line:
  > "If you see my husband Nazeem, remind him that he's not married to himself."

  
Additionally, Ahlam's dialogue about "men are all the same" is now conditioned to only play when spoken to by female characters, addressing what seems to have been an oversight in the original game. She won't for example gossip about Nazeem when he is near her. I think this new dialogue brings more depth to Ahlam’s character, showing her moodyness depending on her location and role, and providing a richer experience when interacting with her in Whiterun. Bethesda simply didnt have the time to flesh out her character more and went with her dialogue being only heard as greetings instead of conversations, the other dialogue lines didnt even get recorded as she wasnt deemed so important to focus development on her. There were simply too many ends that had to be tied up before release to focus on side characters.
