# Lord Jabal - La Orzeca Armor Boss Integration
- Author: Ecskrillos
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97932


The idea came from the insatiable thirst for satisfaction of getting a cool armor mod dropped from a boss, RPG style.
  
  
Most cool armor mods are obtainable by crafting/chests/AIM. Why not make a boss-level NPC that drops said armor? lets go!
  
 
  
This mod basically adds a boss in the world that wears mod armor. Beat him, and you get the armor. Simple as that.

**[font=Verdana]THE BOSS
  
![](https://imgur.com/sWH3zqp.png)
  
[/font]**The Boss is called **Lord Jabal,** means mountain. He is bigger than your average Redguard (*The pic above does represent his location*)
  
  
Full set of La Orzeca which he will drop upon death. Armed with Daedric Battle Axe.
  
  
Abilities and Spells:
  
Has a lot of melee-focused perks, and a surprise if you hurt him enough
  
  
Lord Jabal will use vanilla animation unless you have animation replacer for NPC-Battle Axe user
  
I no longer provide animation in the file, but I already prepared the necessary folder and condition file for it. Only if you use MCO/SCAR/DAR(OAR)
  
Recommended: [Elden Rim Moveset](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72220?tab=files&file_id=304271) (the one I use in the showcase video)
  
Copy all the .hkx from Elden Rim battleaxe folder(2500016) to this mod folder, there should be folder 7700024, drop all the .hkx there.
  
DON'T copy \_condition.txt! ﻿only .hkx files!
  
If you want other animation pack, make sure it's already SCAR patched, otherwise the boss won't use combo

2 Difficulties, both of them are intended for high level players

**[font=Verdana]TIPS[/font]**
  
coc doomstonepineforest01 to quicktest him.
  
Beware! He has a paralyzing enchanted weapon, which will proc (with a percentage) with a power attack. Adjust your strategy accordingly.
  
He has a surprise for you if you tickle him enough.
  
No matter what the difficulty, I hope you bring at least one follower.
  
  
**[font=Verdana]FAQ
  
[/font]**Q: Why DAR? Move on to OAR!
  
A: I'm sure there are plenty users still sticking to DAR, and OAR compatible with DAR folder, so it's a win win, nothing to argue.
  
  
Q: Where's the location? Why no map Image showing where he is at?
  
A: Google Lady Standing Stone
  
  
Q: Why he's spamming power attack?
  
A: Because he wants to paralyze you and wait for you to back up and annoyingly do it again :)
  
  
Q: Your mod page description is horrible, bad grammar!
  
A: pardon mi, milord, for I am not native to the English speaking land.
  
  
Q: Mid-Playthrough install?
  
A: Should be
  
  
Q: ESL?
  
A: Yep
  
  
Q: He's easy! even with Dovahkiin and Friends Must Die version!
  
A: Ok, hotshot!
  
  
Q: Any plan to add more Boss Integration?
  
A: For sure! I have some ideas for BDOR armors in my mind already!
