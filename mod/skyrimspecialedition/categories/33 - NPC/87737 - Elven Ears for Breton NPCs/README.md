[font=Tahoma]﻿[/font]**[font=Tahoma]DESCRIPTION
  
  
[/font]**

According to TES lore , Bretons are known to have elven blood in their ancestry. However, in the vanilla game, Breton NPCs do not have the physical traits that reflect this aspect of their heritage. This mod aims to remedy that by distributing 4 slightly pointed Ear models to Breton NPCs.
  
With this mod, you can expect to see Breton NPCs, such as merchants, guards, and villagers, sporting Elven Ears that accurately reflect their elven ancestry.
  
This mod is lore-friendly and fits seamlessly into the existing game world without disrupting the narrative or gameplay.
  
The only core dependency for this mod is  [Spell Perk Item Distributor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869).﻿

**[font=Tahoma]COMPATIBILITY
  
  
[/font]**The ears are distributed through SPID and no race records have been changed.
  
Load order doesn't matter.
  
Best used with NPC replacer mods that keep vanilla texture paths
  
like [Pandorable NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19012)﻿ and [Northbourne NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/33336625?tab=user+files)﻿ and [Bijin - CBBE textures and Meshes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35832)﻿.
  
This mod can be used with other NPC mods as well, I use it with Bijin AIO and Dibella's Blessing,
  
but manual patching might be required for best consistency. (I had to disable the ears for 2 NPCs that were edited by Dibella's Blessing.)
  
*( I have used the script from* [Bosmer NPCs have antlers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33349), so you might get a  conflict warning from your mod manager, it doesn't matter which mod wins the conflict as the file is the exact same )
  
  
  
**[font=Tahoma]KNOWN BUGS
  
[/font]**
  
Ear texture doesn't match face on some NPCs- This happens if you use NPC replacer mods that don't use your default skin textures.
  
There is a few ''fixes'' for this, you can disable the NPCs that have this issue from DISTR.ini, or you can use this [patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/5166)﻿
