**[b]Overview**
  
  
Dovah Names[/b] is a [NND](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73081)-based mod that give appropriate names to unnamed Dragons and Dragon Priests.
  
  
  
**Dragons**
  
  
According to the [lore](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dragon_Language):
  
  
> *Dragon names are typically formed of three monosyllabic words that, as a whole, may be rendered as a Shout. Each dragon name is unique, and so dragons are able to use these Shouts to address each other across vast distances.*

Unfortunately, in Skyrim you only meet dozens of "Dragon"s and a handful of actually unique dragons. So **Dovah Names** aims to give that unique name to each dragon you encounter. To achieve that the mod utilizes around 300 of manually picked words that are used in several naming schemes to create a great variety of names.
  
  
This brings around 50 millions unique names, so that you'll probably never see the same dragon twice in your next 1000 playthroughs.
  
Goes well with [Infinite Dragon Variants](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74983) :)
  
  
  
**Dragon Priests**
  
  
> Dragon Priests also usually have names in the dragon language, although often only two syllables long instead of three.

As such, **Dovah Names** also create names for Dragon Priests, using only two words.
  
  
  
**Details**
  
  
Unlike, [Tamrielic Names](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73153) there are not many known Dragon names in the lore, so I had to fallback to "generating" such names. But since the start of these "Names series" mods I was hesitant to use name generators, as they often produce a lot of weird names. This is especially true for Dragon names, that quite often looked more like someone smashed keyboard several times than an actual name in Dragon Language.
  
  
Luckily there is a great site - [Thuum.org](https://www.thuum.org)﻿, that has plenty of information about Dragon Language as well as s dictionary of known words. I went through that dictionary and built several lists of words that are "appropriate" for Dragon names.
  
  
I've tried to find a formula so that names would be:
  

  
1. meaningful as much as it's possible *(given that Dragon Language is only vaguely translatable)*
of reasonable length, so that they are still recognizable as a whole word.
  

  
What has worked quite well is several naming schemes that use *"noun + verb + noun"*  or *"noun + adjective + noun"* words where each word is up to 5 letters long, so 15 letters is absolute maximum length of the name.
  
  
This ensures that most names could have a meaning if interpreted in English. Here are few examples:
  
  

  
* *Bormahsizaankah*: father + lost + pride
Aakzindez: guidance + honorable + fate
  
* Mulaagdeytozein: leader + to bury + worship
Mirfuntgaaf: wind + to fail + ghost
  

(you almost certainly won't ever see these exact dragons in your game :) )
  
  
You can visit a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MaqMhtqoZpAwEHJPnvIDtiXmEVHl_RQDapGeZWfoajQ/edit?usp=sharing) I used to figure out the naming to see more examples.
  
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
  
**Dovah Names** is simply config files for [NPCs Names Distributor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73081) so it inherits all compatibility properties of that mod.
  
  
All dragons from all mods that use default *DragonRace* are supported. If you see dragons without a name, please check compatibility section of [NPCs Names Distributor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73081) for instructions how you could make those dragons get a name.
