**[Summary]**   
This Mod changes the appearances of Camilla Valerius, Ysolda, Sylgja, Temba, Taarie, Muiri, Senna, Grelka and Morwen(DB).
  
This Mod is **STANDALONE** which means no other Mods will be required.
  
You can install them with no problem whatever body types(UNP or CBBE or Vanilla etc...) you are using.
  
This mod is made as Fomod installer, so please install this mod with the mod manager.
  
   
   
[Minor issue]   
   
Grelka has an official bug about marriage that her relationship rank won't rise even though you get the skill training from her.
  
Please use [Relationship Dialogue Overhaul - RDO SE](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1187/?)   
OR use the following console command if you want to marry Grelka. This is the way to rise her relationship rank forcibly.
  
   
[1] Open the console and click her
  
[2] Type setrelationshiprank player 4   
   
   
   
[How to update]   
   
Uninstall the old version and install the new one.

You no longer need any esp from "Bijin All in One-SSE by Mebantiza"   
   
   
   
   
[Solution to problems]
  
   
If the character face gets black or dark   
・Check the load order(Use LOOT or move their esp to the bottom).
  
・Reinstall by overwriting all.
  
・Check the Mods related to this mod's characters.
  
・Check the load order between EEO(Ethereal Elven Overhaul) if you use it and Taarie face is having any problems.
  
   
If there is a neck gap on the character.   
[1]
  
Open console and click the character precisely
  
[2]
  
Type setnpcweight xx (xx has to be the default weight of that character, see the following)

**[How to install manually]**Spoiler   
I really don't recommend tho ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
  
   
-----If you want to have all characters-----
  
   
[1] Pick up esp from 02 ESPs/AIO/ HERE and put it in Data folder
  
(Choose No DLC if you don't have Dragonborn)
  
[2] Pick up all files from 00 Common and put them in Data folder
  
   
[3] Pick up all textures and meshes from 01 Characters/\*Character name/HERE  and put them in Data folder
  
   
[4] Do the same thing at 03 CBBE if you want to give them CBBE body
  
   
[3] Activate esp.
  
   
   
-----If you want to install separately-----
  
   
[1] Pick up the character esp(s) you want to install from 02 ESPs
  
   
[2] Pick up all files from 00 Common and put them in Data folder
  
   
[3] Pick up the character textures and meshes from 01 Characters/\*Character name/ HERE and put them in Data folder
  
   
[4] Do the same thing at 03 CBBE if you want to give them CBBE body
  
   
[3] Activate esp(s).
  
   
   
**[How to change the body type to your liking]**   
Spoiler   
[1] Copy the following 2 body meshes which you want to use from body mod. 
  
    If you want to use the same body as the player character, copy from Data/meshes/actors/character/character assets/here
  
   
    femalebody\_0
  
    femalebody\_1
  
  
  
[2]Overwrite Wives meshes Data/meshes/actors/character/Bijin Wives/here by [1]'s files.
  
\*Copy and overwrite the following files as well if the hands and feet have any seams on the characters.
  
   
femalefeet\_0
  
femalefeet\_1
  
femalehands\_0
  
femalehands\_1
  
   
[3]
  
Done.
  
   
\*You have to change their skin textures as well by yourself if you want to use the special body which doesn't correspond to UNP or CBBE textures.
  
Skin textures are 
  
Data/textures/actors/character/Bijin Wives 00 and 01/here, so you just replace these files if you want to change.
