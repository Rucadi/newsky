Orsimer, or the "Pariah Folk", are the descendants of Mer who followed Trinimac before his transformation into the Daedric Prince called Mauloch or Malacath.

﻿
  
The goal of this mod is to make Orcs look less like caricatures and more like characters. I tried to stay true to the practical nature of the Orsimer- you won’t see over-the-top gorgeous models with impractical flowing locks here- and add some elements relating to each Orc’s place in life and past.
  
  
A few things you will see:
  
  

  
* **Familial ties**- related orcs will share some facial features. Chieftains and their wives and sons all bear some form of red warpaint, a sign of them being the lifeblood of the clan.
**Stronghold representation**- stronghold orcs share the same color of warpaint. Warpaints are somewhat loosely based on position/role in the clan.
  
* **Individual backstories taken into account**- for example, Balagog is sporting hair in the fashion of High Rock, Lurbuk bears a badly healed broken nose, a few still stay clean shaven from their days in the Legion, etc.
**General facial feature edits**- no more cartoonish noses, no more ajar mouths, utilizes Orcodontist’s better teeth mesh, as well as Expressive Facegen Morphs. I feel like it strikes a balance between Skyrim’s original craggy lads and ESO’s more animated, Mer-ish ones.

**About**FOMOD installation, all plugins are ESPFE so they won't use a plugin slot
  
  
Two main file options: Vanilla Teeth, Closed Mouth Version.
  
  
Made with Expressive Racegen Morphs, may not animate as intended without Expressive Facial Animations or the EFM versions of Closed Mouths for Orcs.
  
  
NPCs will use your body and your texture mods (except for some custom hairs and the NPCs edited by the Consistent Older People patch.) No guarantee on race-based skin texture distribution mods floating around, though.
  
  
Not strictly compatible with mods that edit the same NPC records (appearance, skills, inventories, etc.) Whatever record is loaded last will show up in game. When in doubt, use xEdit to check. The game is ancient, there are a gazillion tutorials on how to make patches, so don't ask me to do it for you.
  
  
Should work fine with EasyNPC if you want to use it.
  
  
If using with Dark Face Fix, download the Resources file or you might be missing head parts
  
  
If loading midgame, use [Save Unbaker](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85565) or you will have gaps between bodies and necks.

**Future Plans:**
  

  
* None (revoking plans for HPH version because I wanted to use Closed Mouths but there isn't a HPH/EFM version, and EFM >>> HPH in my opinion)

  
Please note: I am not taking requests for any kind of patch/addon or removing any NPCs from this mod..
  
  
Please do not report compatibility issues as bugs and rule out incompatibilities before reporting! If you find an incompatibility, visit the Forum tab.
  
  
**Be sure to include in any report**
  
1. Did you rule out incompatibilities with your other mods? (If 'no', do that before submitting the report or I'll close it.)
  
2. What choices did you pick in the FOMOD (Vanilla Teeth or Closed Mouths)
  
3. What, if any, patches you installed with the FOMOD?
  
  
If you don't answer these questions in your report, I will close it without reply. I have had way too many people reporting an issue with my mod and then testing it \*for\* users only to find out it was an incompatibility with one of the mods they're using.
  
  
Also, the dark face 'bug' is most likely not an issue with this mod: do not report it as a bug until you've ruled out other mods, please.
  
**Please *do not* contact me to request patches, NPC removal, etc.
  
  
Use the Forum tab to talk about incompatibilities.
