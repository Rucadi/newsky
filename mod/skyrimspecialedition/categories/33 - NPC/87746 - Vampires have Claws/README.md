**[font=Tahoma]﻿[/font][font=Tahoma]DESCRIPTION
  
[/font]**Do you think vampires in Skyrim are missing something? Something that would complete their fearsome look and feel? Look no further.
  
This mod distributes 4 unique sets of sharp, deadly-looking claws to vampire NPCs. While this is a purely cosmetic change,
  
 it adds an extra level of immersion to the game, making your encounters with vampires even more intimidating.
  
The only core dependency for this mod is  [Spell Perk Item Distributor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869).﻿

[font=Tahoma]**COMPATIBILITY**[/font]

[font=Tahoma]
  
No compatibility issues due to the nature of this mod, the claws are distributed through SPID and no race records have been changed.[/font]Load order doesn't matter.
  
*( I have used the script from**[Bosmer NPCs have antlers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33349), so you might get a  conflict warning from your mod manager, it doesn't matter which mod wins the conflict as the file is the exact same )*
