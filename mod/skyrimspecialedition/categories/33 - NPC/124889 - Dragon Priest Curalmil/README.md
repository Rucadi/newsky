**Dragon Priest Curalmil**

Simple change to Curalmil, encountered in Forsaken Cave during the White Phial quest, so that he is always a Dragon Priest. I always found it a bit strange that a master alchemist would be a tanky-heavily-armoured-Death-Lord. 
  
  
Apparently, Curalmil has a chance at spawning as a Dragon Priest in Vanilla but personally, I have never seen him as one. Probably because Marked for Death is a good Shout and roleplaying-wise, my character would always try to get to the cave sooner rather than later to try and help the old alchemist. 
  
  
Curalmil is now obviously much stronger so be prepared! 
  
  

**﻿****Versions of the Mod**

  
There are two versions of the mod. 
  
  
1) Replacer version. Simply changes Curalmil to a shock Dragon Priest, nothing more.
  
2) Replacer and Mask Version. Same as above but also adds an extra reward for defeating Curalmil: "Motmahus" - a Dragon Priest Mask that has a 25% increase to Alchemy. To make it even more unique, I modified "Krosis", removing it's fortify alchemy with a 20% increase to sneak. Motmahus means "Slippery" or "Elusive" in the Dragon Tongue which I thought worked well as the Altmer described Curalmil as a "crafty one".
