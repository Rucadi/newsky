**Fully Voiced!**
  
  
**V4.0!** Adds even more Cosmetic Champion Varieties!
  
**V3.8:** Chaos damage fixes! Also added a **Summon Chaos Warrior Power!** (See Optional Files)
  
**V3.5:** New Sorcerer Variants! Special Thanks to Xenosapiens for the helmet!
  
**V3.2:** Increases Rarity of Items Dropped by Champions & Fixes Sorcerers
  
**V3.0:** Added 3 more Champion Archetypes! The Chosen, The Berserker, & The Sorcerer!

  

**﻿This mod will add a new random Boss variant to all vanilla "Boss Encounter" leveled lists: the** **Chaos Champion!**Champions may also sometimes be found wandering the northern coastlines.
  
  
Champions hit hard like Centurions and have the same health as Master Vampires!
  
However, they are slow and cumbersome. Time your attacks!
