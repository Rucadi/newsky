**Description**
  
  
While working on my other mod, [Default Face NPCs Fixed](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54515), I noticed all Dremora were male and had the same face. In addition, they had a very small pool of headparts to choose from. As such, I made this mod.
  
  
This mod does the following:
  
  

  
* Adds female Dremora, with their own voice files. (These are male voice files with the pitch raised.)
Adds human brows to Dremora.
  
* Adds human and elf beards to male Dremora.
Adds vampire eyes for some Dremora.
  
* Adds human and elf hairstyles to Dremora.
Each Dremora is given a unique face, up to a total of 216 different faces.
  
* Adds head parts from [Hallgarth's Dremora Assets](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/100335)﻿. (included in this mod, not a requirement to download.)
Velehk Sain, the Unbound Dremora, the Dremora Merchant and the Dremora Butler cannot be female NPCs and have a unique appearance instead of pulling from a pool of leveled NPCs. This is done to prevent voice files from being unable to play if they're female.
  
* Conjure Dremora Lord has a different appearance every time you cast the spell.

  
  
**Compatibility**
  
  
This mod is compatible with my other mod, [Dremora Combat Dialogue Tweak](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93583), without the need of any patches.

**FAQ**
  
  
Q: Patch for High Poly head?
  
A: I believe High Poly Face has a patcher that you can run in xEdit, to make your own patches. I'm not going to make one, because it will conflict with other patches, so I will need to make patches for patches, that require patches and have patches for other mods. As such, I want to avoid that patching hell.
  
  
Q: Will you make a seperate version without the beards?
  
A: No.
  
  
Q: ESPFE?
  
A: Yes.
  
  
Q: Does installing/updating/uninstalling on an existing save work?
  
A: As far as I know, it should. However, it's good practice to keep a backup save prior to doing this, just in case.
  
  
Q: Is this compatible with <insert mod>?
  
A: I don't know by heart. You might need to check yourself.
  
  
Q: Will you make a patch for <insert mod>?
  
A: I'm done making patches for this mod. Feel free to do it yourself. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: I have a suggestion to improve the mod. Can you do it?
  
A: Maybe, if I have time and I like the idea, I'll consider it.
  
  
Q: Will you port this to <insert platform>?
  
A: No, I myself only support the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If someone else wants to port it, feel free. (see permission) If you decide to port it, you yourself take full responsibility to offer support to said port. I will not provide no support for any ports by third parties.
  
  
Q: I use a ported version of this mod on <insert platform> and I have a problem. Can you help?
  
A: I don't provide any support for third party ports on other platforms than the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If you have issues, you should adress the person that ported it.
  
  
Q: Does this work on Skyrim 1.6+, aka "Anniversary Edition"?
  
A: Yes, it should.
  
  
Q: Why don't your mods use MCMs and instead use this janky console command system to set globals?
  
A: I am not a fan of MCMs. You can set the globals by making a patch in xEdit. I have no plans of changing this. If you want to add an MCM, feel free. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: Why don't you use FOMODs?
  
A: That would require reuploading the entire mod, in question, even if I only make a small change. My internet is limited and reuploading the files each time will take a huge chunk of my monthly volume.
