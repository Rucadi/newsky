# SkyChild Patch Collection
- Author: triptherift
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/128781


This is where you will find patches for SkyChild, either made by me or submitted to me by others. SkyChild has open permissions, so if you make a mod patch, please share it with the community.
  
  
I am also including documents and resources in the Optional Files section with instructions on how to easily make your own patches. It assumes you know how to use Nifskope and SSEedit. I do not recommend using the CK to make patches, you're just going to make a big mess of things. Just don't.
  
  
You might want to track this so you know when new patches are uploaded. My first priority is to convert all the existing TKAA patches to SkyChild. THIS TAKES TIME. Some mods add dozens of kids. Please be patient.
  
  
A few additional things - If the mod being patched was in loose files, then so is the patch, for compatibility. If the mod was archived in a bsa, so is the patch. I don't always include tints for every kid in a patch. It depends on if I change them in the plugin or not. Some of these mod authors use tints so dark on Nord kids they should call them Redguard. I change those out typically. If I don't include a tint, don't panic, the one in the original mod gets used. And finally, Wild Child will be converted over.
  
  
Obviously, you'll need SkyChild, from [HERE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/128779)
  
  
Mod authors - If you let me know when you upload patches, I'll link them here. And thank you for pitching in!
