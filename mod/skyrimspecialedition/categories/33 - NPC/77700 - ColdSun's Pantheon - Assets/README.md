Pantheon is a series of Followers and NPC Replacers that I consider to be my top tier quality. I've taken all I've learned and tried to make improvements across the board. You really shouldn't be using any of my old mods that aren't labeled with the Pantheon logo. First of all, they just aren't as good. Second, they aren't being updated at all. I plan to continuously update Pantheon mods and also provide new ones in the series over time. Follow me here on Nexus to say when I make updates to my mods. So what is different about Pantheon mods verus my ColdSun's World mods?
  
  

  
* 4K Skin Diffuse instead of 8K Diffuse - better optimization
Normalization of plugin records and assets - reusing assets that are common over and over for better performance
  
* Using the best skin currently available in Skyrim SE - BNP Skin by [Swefrida](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/84577193?tab=user+files)﻿ and [Khisartin](https://www.ddsworkshop.net/)﻿.
Using superior eye mods from past creations
  
* Almost every single NPC was touched - new makeup, sometimes completely new facial designs, new hairstyles

  
**This is the Assets mod for Pantheon**. It is required for every mod labeled with the Pantheon name. Download the version which fits your body type.

**NPC Packs** - Replacers for Skyrim SE's vanilla named NPCs including the DLCs.
  
**Legends** - Followers that are based on existing legends or with extended features above standard followers.
  
**Woken Furies** - Followers that used to be part of a follower pack named Woken Furies (name based on the Gunship song of the same name).
  
**Beautiful Synergy** - Followers that are based on the popular mod Synergy with enhanced skills and spells.
  
**Operation Overlife** - Replacers for vanilla and DLC encounter NPCs (Bandits, Foresworn, Vampires, and more).

There are many benefits to using asset hub mods like this one:
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/yI1LeWo.png)  Assets like NIF files and DDS textures that are commonly used over and over on followers and replacers are placed in the asset mod and are no longer taking up all that extra space on your hard drive by having the same duplicate files for each follower or replacer
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/yI1LeWo.png) Since we are pointing to these commonly used assets in each mod's plugin file (example: skin textures), we are saving a vast amount of texture memory for your other mods because we not loading a different texture asset for each follower.  Imagine the savings on 100+ NPC replacers.
  
  
**So what's in this mod exactly?**
  
  
**NIF Files** - common head and hair NIF files.
  
**DDS Files** - common body, eye, and hair texture files.
  
**Blankdetailmap.DDS** - fixes seams on the neck for even the most detailed ENB.
  
**Bodyslide Preset** - The Pantheon body preset for the body you use (3BA/CBBE or BHUNP). Allows you to slide outfits to the Pantheon body with bodyslide.﻿

Most support is handled in my Discord Channel (#coldsun-corner) on [Migal Makes Mods Discord Server](https://discord.gg/JrpPh6F2tu). You can also try [contacting me on my profile page](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/9762372) here on the Nexus, but that method will take longer for me to respond. We have a nice community there - stop by and get to know everyone. If I'm not there myself, we have many folks who have experience with my mods that often step forward to help out. I'll try to answer questions in the comments tab of my mods, but more detailed responses really should be handles in private messages or via Discord.
  
  
Be patient with me and I will be patient and helpful with you. I don't tolerate rudeness, or passive aggressive comments here. Depending on the comments made, it is possible that I ban the offender without any further warning. Also, if people just can't be nice I will just shut down all comments. I would rather spend my time creating more mods for people that appreciate them.

These mods are recommended to get the best use out of my mods. Some of my voiced-followers have their own follower system and can't be imported to things like EFF or NFF - so I've included at least one outfit management mod to help you dress your voiced followers. There are many of them on Nexus, I just posted one of my favorites. You also don't need the full install of High Poly Head for any of my mods to work.
