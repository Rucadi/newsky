**- WHAT YOU GET -**
  
  
A visual overhaul for the charming and suuuper-popular vendor **Carlotta** of Whiterun.
  
  
2 eye choices (screenshots in the gallery).
  
  
She is flagged [X] PROTECTED(from the start) and [X] MARRIAGEABLE(after you become her friend). 
  
  
No bodies or skins included, for maximum compatibility. 
  
  
---
  
  
Also she can become marriageable, and her daughter Mila can become adoptable: this is a separate standalone patch that does not require my replacer to work, so its **compatible with every other Carlotta (or Mila) replacer**. 
  
  
  
  
**- HOW YOU GET -**
  
  
There are 3 possible outcomes with this mod:
  
- Carlotta becomes a very good friend and let you stay in her home.
  
- Carlotta becomes your wife and you live with her and Mila in her home.
  
- Carlotta becomes your wife, Mila becomes your adopted daughter and you go live all together in a suitable player home. 
  
  
The 1st step is becoming Carlotta's friend, that usually happens when you help her get rid of Mikael's advances. Her RelationshipRank to the Player is set to 1 (friend), this is all vanilla behavior. 
  
After that, this mod gives you a new line of dialogue (all new dialogue is voiced) that let you ask her if she needs anything else. She will understand that you are more than just a friend and she will give you a key to her house and her RelationshipRank will be set to 2 (Confidant).
  
  
Now, if you so choose, you can take things a step further and ask her to marry you, with the normal vanilla Skyrim marriage system: talk to Maramal, get an amulet of Mara, etc.
  
At the end of the ceremony, tell her you want to live together in her house, kablammo: you are now a real family.
  
Carlotta will keep all her AI packages, she will work at her stall, go to the Mare in the evenings, etc. But now she will also homecook you meals and give you some coin from her new shop (she already had one, lol), all thanks to the vanilla system, absolute maximum immersive compatibility. 
  
  
Last step is the adoption of Mila, but to do this you will have to forfeit having the 2 Valentia girls roaming Whiterun as per vanilla behavior.
  
After you are married to Carlotta, you will be able to ask Mila "why she is sad"... I suggest you click on that line of dialogue **only if you have a player home ready to be filled with your family**, even better if you have already told your wife Carlotta to move/live there...
  
  
If you decide that "Mila is sad" she will gain vanilla adoption lines of dialogues and you will be able to properly adopt the girl, again with the normal Hearthfire adoption system. 
  
I suppose choosing the Breezehome as your family home is the closest thing you can have as the full package: Carlotta will stay indoor, but Mila will be able to go play outside with her Whiterun friends. 
  
  
  
  
**- F.A.Q. -**
  
  
**Other mods do the same, one at least?**
  
Confront them all and choose mine- I mean choose the one that suits you best! 
  
  
**Do I need this?**
  
Yes!
  
  
**I already did the "Kick Mikael's butt" quest?**
  
Carlotta will be ready to become your... special friend.
  
  
**I was friend with Carlotta prior to the quest, so I was able to marry her BEFORE kicking Mikael's butt?**
  
Kicking someone's butt because they sweet-talk your wife is EXTREMELY immersive.
  
  
**I have no dialogue, she is not my fren anymore after I stole 99 tomatoes from her yesterday?**
  
If for some reason she is not at least Rank 1 in her relationship to you, you have to fix that. Mods like [Sidequests](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54245) can restore friendship with an NPC, otherwise you have to use console commands.
  
  
**Does it work with custom homes?**
  
Yes I tested it with a couple of modded player homes, just use the spell "Bless Home" as usual.
  
  
**Can I marry her and live in her house while I have no player homes, and LATER ask her to move + adopt Mila?**
  
Yes: I suggest first tell Carlotta to change houses, then go ask Mila why "she is sad" and adopt her. 
  
  
**Carlotta and/or Mila are not showing up in my new home?**
  
Both vanilla systems are janky af, I am sure you are well aware by now... All the bugs and glitches you can encounter with vanilla spouses and vanilla adopted children can manifest with the Valentias as well, but also all the possible fixes.
  
  
**Mila replacer in the first image?**
  
[TKAA Renewal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48297?), but there is a newer one made by the same modder, [Skychild](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/128779) (it is basically an HPH version of the first).
  
  
**Non-replacer follower soon?**
  
Yes, here: [MW Umbreia](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/133550).
  
  
**Presetswhere?**
  
Yes, here: [MW Outlaw](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/128217). 
  
  
**You made an error here?**
  
Sorry, tell me what and where and I will try to fix it.
  
  
**Do you have any other moddos laying around?**
