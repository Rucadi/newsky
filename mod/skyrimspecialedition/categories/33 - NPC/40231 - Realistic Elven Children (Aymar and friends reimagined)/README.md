**Realistic Elven Children**

A makeover of the mer children added by Aymar and friends﻿

  
[line]
  
By popular request, I've made my own edits to the popular mer children mod, [Aymar and friends](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4847)﻿, in the same style as my mod [Realistic RS Children](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39359)﻿. I was thinking about making my own -mer children mod, but found nothing wrong with mdfeelgood's additions, and plus I'm a user of the mod already! This currently adds 8 mer children, two of each race (Bosmer, Altmer, Dunmer, Orsimer).
  
  
As with the original mod, all children use the default child voices (of which there are only two, sadly)
  
This can be safely installed mid playthrough, since it only adds new NPCs. It can also be installed in an existing save over the top of the original Aymarandfriends.esp, since this only makes changes to the children's faces.
  
  
**Requirements:**
  

  
1. [RS Children Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2650)﻿
[KS Hairdos 1.7+](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6817)﻿ **or optional file**
  

  
**Installation:**
  

  
1. Make sure you have RS Children installed
**If you don't have KS Hairdos 1.7+,** install the optional textures file.
  
2. Install this mod, and the mer children will be added to your game (or if you already use Aymar and friends, they will have new faces!)

  
I've also added an optional file which changes the children's names to ones I currently use in my game. Take a look!

**Child descriptions from original mod.**
  
Numbered as pictured, let to right, top to bottom.
  
**1. Aymar**
  
Aymar is an orphaned Dunmer boy living in Windhelm. He can be found in the New Gnisis Cornerclub and will happily go with you at the slightest invitation.
  
  
**2. Minedhel and 3. Methredhel**
  
These two siblings were unfortunately orphaned when their hunter parents died somewhere in the wilderness (probably attacking a bear, or something). They were able to make it to Stonehills, the nearest settlement, but have been stuck there ever since.  They can be adopted separately.  Incidentally, Methredhel is a girl, she just likes running around in her big brother's clothes.  She'll wear a dress if you give her one.

**4. Llevana**
  
Llevana managed to make her way to Winterhold, only to find that the College of Winterhold doesn't accept children. Now she's stuck in the Frozen Hearth inn with Nelacar and his...experiments. Can someone *please* get her out of here?
  
  
[/size]**5. Uzul**
  
Uzul has spent his whole life in the stronghold of Dushnikh Yal.  Not many opportunities there, unless you're interested in mining (and he's not).  He'd love to see the world, or at least a different part of it.
  
  
[size=3]**6. Faelian**
  
Faelian has lived a hard life so far being an unwanted child in a harsh city like Markarth. He tries to act haughty like Ondolemar and the other Thalmor in Understone Keep, but under the frowny exterior he's just looking for a little kindness. (To find Faelian, go to Understone Keep, up the stairs like you're going to talk to the Jarl, then head right at the top of the stairs, where the Thalmor always pace back and forth. He's usually sitting in one of the chairs, or sometimes wanders into the smithing area.)[/size]
  
  
**7. Eilonwy**
  
Eilonwy is an Altmer girl who's staying in the Solitude Temple of the Divines.
  
  
**8. Batul**
  
She can be found in Warmaiden's and uses the default female child voice (a bit jarring on an orc, but it's tolerable because they're tiny). She's wearing a blacksmith oufit, because if you have to have an Orc child running around, why not teach them a little smithing? But really Batul just wants a family, like the other kids.
