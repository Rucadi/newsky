**Overview****Tamrielic Names** is a [NND](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73081)-based mod that names all previously unnamed (generic) NPCs, such as "Whiterun Guard", "Merchant", "Thief", etc. goes well with mods such as [Populated Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32190) that add even more nameless NPCs.
  
  
It uses [Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Names)﻿ as a source of names that are already present in TES Lore. As a result, all NPCs will have authentic, yet diverse names.
  
  
**Tamrielic Names** takes into account various aspects of each Race's culture that are described on [UESP](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Names). Here are relevant quotes:
  
  
  
**Altmer**
  
  
> *﻿Altmer have incredibly lengthy full names due to their long-standing heritage and value for family.
>   
> As such, most Altmer tend to not display their last names.*

  
Nothing special in Altmer's case, **Tamrielic Names** provides around 900 names for each gender, and occasionally give last name or title.
  
  
  
**Argonian**
  
  
> *﻿Generally Argonians utilize two types of names from different languages: [Jel](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Jel) and Tamrielic.*

  
Argonians have rich lore on their naming conventions, that were carefully represented in **Tamrielic Names**. Most Argonians use their Jel names, but occasionally you'll encounter Argonians with translated Tamrielic names.
  
  
**Jel Names**
  
  
> *Chukka-sei is an Argonian traditional Naming day, which comes in the Argonian season of Hist-Dooka (Second Seed). On that day, a young Saxhleel licks the [Hist Sap](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Hist_Sap) and receives their name. It is not clear whether the young Saxhleel's name is granted by their elder tribesman or by the Hist itself, but the name is definitely obtained through a Hist, hence native-born (born and raised to maturity in Black Marsh) Argonians that had successfully passed their Chukka-Sei would receive their aborigine name in the native Argonian language of Jel. Most likely this name is what they reference to outsiders as their "Black Marsh name".*

  
**Tamrielic Names** provides around 700 Jel names for each gender.
  
  
**Tamrielic Names**
  
  
> *Obtaining a Tamrielic name for an Argonian may vary between individuals. Sometimes, the Tamrielic name is a direct translation of their Jel name. For instance, an Argonian named "Haj-Ei" may take on the Tamrielic name "Hides His Eyes". "Haj" in Jel roughly means "hidden", and "Ei" means "eye" or "eyes". It is possible that the Tamrielic name may be used preferentially when the Argonian's Jel name is considered unpronounceable, unnecessary, inappropriate or unsuitable.*

**Tamrielic Names** provides around 220 translated Argonian names for each gender.
  
  
  
**Bosmer**
  
  
> *﻿Most Bosmer do not have family names, but there are a few exceptions.*

Nothing special, **Tamrielic Names** provides around 800 names for each gender. And rarely give one of 200 family names.
  
  
  
**Breton**
  
Nothing special,**Tamrielic Names** provide around 900 given names for each gender and 850 family names.
  
  
**Dunmer**
  
Nothing special,**Tamrielic Names** provide around 900 given names for each gender and 750 family names.
  
  
**Khajiit**
  
  
Khajiits also have complex naming conventions, that were successfully captured and represented in **Tamrielic Names**:
  
> *﻿Khajiit names mostly describe the talents or skills of the to-be-named.
>   
>   
> Sometimes Khajiit take a byname or nickname with meaning, either [Cyrodilic](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Cyrodilic) or in [Ta'agra](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Ta%27agra). They can be taken additionally to the Khajiiti name, either as suffix (e.g. [M'Aiq **the Liar**](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:M%27Aiq_the_Liar) or [Ra'zaym **Iron-Ear**](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Ra%27zaym_Iron-Ear)), or a prefix (e.g. [**Krin** Ren-dro](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Krin_Ren-dro) or [**Sugar-Lips** Habasi](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Sugar-Lips_Habasi)). Nicknames also can be used in appropriate situation, but note that they do not replace the name entirely. (e.g. [Eats-Spiders](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Eats-Spiders) or [Kink-Tail](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Kink-Tail)). In this case, they never have an honorific added.*

  
**Tamrielic Names** provides around 900 Ta'agra names for each gender as a baseline.
  
  
**Honorifics**
  
  
> *﻿Another important aspect of Khajiit names are honorifics, more commonly amongst males than females. They reflect their status in life or society, and can change accordingly. Thus, it is considered improper and insulting to apply a wrong honorific. Commonly a Khajiit takes up just one honorific at a time, as using two either shows great ignorance or great pride. They also sometimes are given in terms of endearment, banter or deceit.*

  
> *﻿Honorifics are usually a prefix before a Khajiit's name, usually separated by an apostrophe, uncommonly a hyphen, or rarely without separation. During the mid-[Second Era](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Second_Era) however, suffixed honorifics were the norm, separated by a hyphen, with prefixed honorifics being seen as a fashionable fad among the youth of [Alabaster](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Alabaster_(settlement)). If a honorific is taken as prefix, they can be shortened to one letter. Suffixed honorifics never are shortened. Ta'agra names can also contain apostrophes or hyphens, which does not necessarily make parts of names an honorific.*

  
Honorifics are randomly applied either as a prefix or as a suffix.
  
As a result there are around 28000 Ta'agra name variants that you might encounter.
  
  
**Tamrielic Titles**
  
  
As the lore suggests, some Khajiits might take a byname or nickname. **Tamrielic Names** is limited to suffix only nickanmes and has around 100 of them for each gender. That increases the total variaty of Khajiit names up to a whooping 2.8 million variants. That's indeed an overkill, but why not? :D
  
  
  
**Nord**
  
  
> **﻿***Nords have no family name. However, some Nords have clans, or titles added after or occasionally before their given name. Titles as suffixes are often hyphenated.*

  
Starting from Morrowind Nords no longer had family names in form of patronyms, instead they've been using various titles appearing before of after given name. In **Tamrielic Names** patrnoyms (and rarely matrnoyms) are used for majority (around 70%) of Nords who hasn't earned a special title, yet. It provides around 1200 Nord names for each gender. With as many possible patornyms or matronyms and 600 titles that Nords can get for their deeds.
  
  
  
**Orc**
  
  
> *﻿Orc family names are usually (but not always) prefixed depending on gender: "gro-" for males, and "gra-" for females. The prefix is usually followed by the name of the Orc's clan or the stronghold where they were born.*

  
As the lore says, **Tamrielic Names** provides around 700 Orc names for each gender and 250 clan names with an appropriate prefix.
  
  
  
**Redguard**
  
  
> *In addition to their given name, sometimes Redguards will also have a surname, of sorts, deriving from a person or place that they are related to.
>   
> The prefixes for these derivation names are as follows:
>   
>
>   
> * **at-** = "Direct descendant of"
> **af-** = "Related to" (niece/nephew/cousin)
>   
> * **al-** = "Comes from" (location)
>
> There is a fourth prefix, "**aj-**" but its meaning is currently unknown*

  
Though, Redguards have their unique prefix conventions, I choose to use pre-existing surnames, with already prefixes, because these prefixes are dependent on the context and the meaning of surnames's "base", so they can't be mixed with other "bases".
  
  
With that said, **Tamrielic Names** provides around 900 Redguard names for each gender. And rarely give one of 150 derived surnames.
