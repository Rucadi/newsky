**Simply House Maid**
  
**House Maid**, a very simple mod that add 13 maids to tend each of vanilla houses, as well as some houses from Creation Club.
  
  
**ESLified**, this mod won't count toward your plugin limit. 
  
  
**Use your default skin and body type**, for better compatibility. 
  
  
**Activity**, the maids will not just stay home all day, they have various activities, sometimes they shop in the market for supplies, visit temples, drink at the inn, take a break and hang out in city center, and more. On Sundas, they will take a day off and spend the whole day at their favorite places.
