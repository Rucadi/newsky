Simple mod which distributes a bit of hp, mp, stamina and damage to the guard faction and non player faction housecarls. Also fixes Irileth dealing half damage to dragons. Done through SPID. Plans to extend it to all friendly npcs which it would make sense. ESPFE.
  
  
Tired of guards being one shotted by dragons? Installed triangle dragon mod? Guards dying to bears? I have a solution for you. SPID required.
