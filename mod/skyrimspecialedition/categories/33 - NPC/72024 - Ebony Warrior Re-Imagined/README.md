Well I did, so I gave him some more Room to brag.
  
  

Lore:

  
I his travels The Ebony Warrior met many foes, one being a blacksmith who found a way to enhance the property of Ebony.
  
He managed to increase the durability and reduce weight. Due to the use of magic the armor began to glow.
  
Due to the heavy use of magic he became mad. He started to call himself "The Ebony Overlord".
  
In his wicked ways he started to mindlessly slaughter every human and creature unfortunate to cross his path.
  
The Ebony Warrior took the opportunity to challenge the blacksmith as his final trial to go to sovngarde, being a strong foe he defeated him with ease, soon he heard of a Hero known as The Dragonborn.
