- Author: Canliberk and his team
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

This mod is only intended for our collection users. It makes no sense for non-collection users to use this mod. You've been warned :)
  
  
  
  
So you installed one of the Immersive collections and have some questions in your mind. That's normal!
  
You installed 100s of mods. This mod aims to help the users in a semi-immersive way.

What Is This Mod?
  
This mod is created for my collection users as an in-game tutorial tool, with some cool voice lines attached to a NPC you can find at the starting area. If you are not using any of the Immersive Collections, this mod serves no purpose whatsoever.
  
  
Features
  
  
Apart from being able to punch me any time you see a bug in our collections and awful voice acting (sorry for my middle eastern accent :D ) , you'll be able to ask questions like these:
  
  

  
* How Can I Customize my Skills And Perks?
How Do You Control The Adult Scenes?
  
* How Can I Customize My Apparance?
﻿Tell me more about the backstory editing
  
* Tell me more about the perk system
Tell me more about physics enabled hair types
  
* Tell me more about body types
Tell me more about different preset options
  
* Can i still do the main quest?
Can i still do the original start?
  

  
And a lot more. Most importantly:
  

  
* Who is your lord and saviour?

  
  
  
  
**Installation**You need to have one of our collections installed first.
  
This mod will be included in our collections automatically so hopefully you won't have to install this as an extra :)
  
You can still install it via a mod manager or install it manually though.
