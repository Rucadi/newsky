**Overview
  
  
Reachmen Tribes Names** is a [NND](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73081)-based mod that provides names for [Reachmen](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Reachmen), also known in Skyrim as Forsworn. It is an expansion to [Tamrielic Names](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73153) that adds an additional layer of lore details.
  
  
Similarly to [Tamrielic Names](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73153)  it draws information from [Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Names)﻿ to be true to the lore.
  
  
**Forsworn**
  
  
In Skyrim all (most) Forsworns are Bretons. As such [Tamrielic Names](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73153) will give them traditional Breton names. **Reachmen Tribes Names** instead will give Forsworns names that are specific to their tribal culture.
  
  
> *﻿The Reachmen, also known as the **Reachfolk** or **Witchmen of High Rock**, are a race of humans who are native to [the Reach](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:The_Reach) in southwestern [Skyrim](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Skyrim) and the neighboring [Western Reach](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Western_Reach) in the east of [High Rock](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:High_Rock). They are believed to be closely related to the [Bretons](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Breton) and some Reachmen believe that their people originally came from High Rock. While Reachmen are distinct, they are also mixed with other races that make up Man, Mer, and even Daedra. Similarly to the Bretons, Aldmeri blood runs through their veins, which stems from the [Direnni](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Direnni) Hegemony's occupation of the [Western Reach](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Western_Reach) in the early First Era.*

**Forsworn Matriarchs**
  
  
**Reachmen Tribes Names** also provides an add-on that will give appropriate names to Hagravens, who are closely related to Forsworn folks:
  
  
> ﻿Hagravens are creatures of corruption and decay that appear as a horrific cross between an old crone and a bird. Usually they are extremely hostile to outsiders, but they retain the ability to communicate. 
>   
> They can often be found in the company of [Reachmen](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Reachmen) clans, who often revere hagravens as their Matriarchs and leaders.

  
  
P.S. These were fun mods to work on, as I had a chance to dive into the lore and explore rich TES universe.
