**Aela the Huntress** is a fierce, skilled Nord warrior and a key member of the **Companions**. She is proud, passionate, and deeply committed to the old ways of Skyrim, and is not easily impressed but respects strength, bravery, and loyalty.
  
She reveres *Hircine*, the *Daedric Prince of the Hunt*, and embraces her lycanthropy as a sacred gift rather than a curse. Unlike some Companions who consider curing lycanthropy to reclaim their humanity, Aela fully embraces her beast form as her true self. Her strength, mystique, and no-nonsense demeanor make her one of the fan favorites when it comes to followers and spouses.
  
  
My interpretation of Aela is entirely focused on her Nord roots and lycanthropy — someone who embraces the inner beast and is unashamed of her ferocity and determination. Beyond the many eye color and warpaint options you can choose from, I wanted her to have her signature warpaint, and I also added yellow eyes to match her werewolf blood. I wanted her to have a strong face, as I like to do with my Nord women, rather than making her look generically pretty, too young, or overly beautified.
  
  
  
**This update is a small gift to everyone who has supported this mod over the years.
  
We’ve reached the milestone of 1,000 endorsements, and this is my way of saying
  
THANK YOU!** ![](https://i.imgur.com/LsSQZ15.gif)﻿

> **Details, requirements and important info:**
>   
>   
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/TNHuuxo.gif)﻿[font=Georgia]The mod comes with two plugin options: one with **custom armor** and one that uses the **vanilla armor**. Both versions are **flagged as ESL**, and you can choose which one you want during installation via FOMOD. Custom armor version requires the standalone [Savior's Hide 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/129638)﻿ by Furexarot. [/font]There, you can select your preferred fur color, armor variant, and download the Bodyslide files. I created this setup to give users more flexibility in customizing the armor to their preferences.
>   
>   
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/TNHuuxo.gif)﻿Since this is a major update, I decided to **completely remake the plugin** to avoid any issues. It now also includes the necessary data from USSEP. This means that if you're updating from the old version, **please dismiss Aela if she's currently your follower, go alone to an interior cell, make a save, uninstall the old mod, and then install the new version.** USSEP is absolutely required for this update.
>   
>   
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/TNHuuxo.gif)﻿The new plugin sets her weight to 50 instead of the vanilla 20. If you installed it mid-game and are seeing a neck gap (or want to prevent one), I recommend you to have [Save Unbaker](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85565)﻿ in your load order.[font=Georgia]
>   
>   
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/TNHuuxo.gif)I remade her face from scratch, just like I did with Serana in her major update. I also gave her more realistic eyes and completely reworked her warpaints and makeup. Her skin was left untouched in this update, as I didn’t feel it was necessary to change. It’s a custom skin with some hand-painted details by me, but full credit goes to the *Swefrida* sisters for **BnP Female Skin**.
>   
>   
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/TNHuuxo.gif)**I won’t be providing patches for mods I don’t use**, such as Diverse Werewolves, AI Overhaul, or any other mods that may alter her records. If you’d like to create a patch for one of these, feel free to contact me via Nexus DM or through my channel on the **Modharbour** Discord server (linked below in the very bottom of this modpage).
>   
> [ReformedDevil5000](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/ReformedDevil5000)﻿ made a patch for *Diverse Werewolves* and other mods [**here**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/153618)﻿.

>   
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/TNHuuxo.gif)I don’t use **RSV**, but if you do and it’s affecting Aela’ skin, you’ll need to add the **Keyword** to ignore her**.** Again, I don't use this mod, so I can't help much with that. Same goes with **OBody**. The max I can do is point you the bodyslide I used to make her standalone body meshes, which is [The Common Lass](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/113963)﻿﻿.
>   
>   
> ![](https://i.imgur.com/TNHuuxo.gif)**I can’t provide support for issues caused by your specific load order**. This mod is standalone and has been tested by at least three people and it’s working as intended, anything beyond that is on your end. Please read the mod pages of your other mods before coming to mine claiming this one isn’t working.

> [font=Georgia]          You are free to dislike this replacer. Really, you’re entirely free to prefer one replacer or author over another, this is why mods should be diverse. But you’re also free to simply close this mod and move on — I can't care less. **The mod is exactly the way I want it to be**.[/font]

> [font=Georgia]**![](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/c9f6b605da71.gif)I won't provide presets.** This is a NPC replacer, not your player character. Please be respectful and **don't ask me about that in comments, DMs or Discord ❌**
>   
>   
> ![](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/c9f6b605da71.gif)This mod was made for myself, so I won't be taking requests and I don't do commissions (paid or not). **There won't be special versions of this character tailored for your personal liking**, as, again, this mod was made for my own game according to my preferences. I would also appreciate if you keep unsolicited suggestions and nitpick for yourself.
>   
>   
> ❌**You are not allowed**❌ to do modifications for redistribution of this character or its assets (publicly or privately). This includes: de-standalone versions, bodyslide or skin edits, and any modifications big or small (Skypatcher, xEdit or any way to use that character's face in another character). **All assets must remain inside this mod**, as required by the original permissions from other mod authors, and I intend to respect the authors’ wishes, as you should do as well.
>

> ![](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/c9f6b605da71.gif)If you want to do your personal use modifications, **do it in private and don't ask for support from me or others in my comments**. Be aware that this type of comment will be hidden and if you insist, you can end up blocked from interacting with my content.

> [/font][font=Georgia]❗❗ If you want to make a patch or translation, **contact me via Nexus DMs first**. Written permission is required before publishing anything. I’ll most likely grant you permission (with my mod set as a requirement), but contacting me first allows me to keep track of what’s being done with my work and for why, and also provides you with proof of authorization for your own peace of mind. ❗❗

> **![](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/c9f6b605da71.gif)I respectfully ask that you don't use my mods for NSFW thumbnails, and that NSFW images not be uploaded to this modpage.** These mods were not created with that purpose in mind, and there’s plenty of content on Nexus designed for that. Please be respectful, as seeing this kind of misuse is genuinely demotivating.

> **❗❗ I host and maintain my mods exclusively on Nexus Mods** ❗❗
>   
>   
> If you find them anywhere else, it’s not my responsibility and it means my permissions, as well as those of other authors, have been violated. **Don’t support disrespectful content thieves masquerading as “Robin Hood Community Saviors"**, as their entitlement, harassment, and baseless insults to mod authors are a big part of why many are leaving the modding scene and no longer releasing their work publicly, which is a loss for all players, including you and me.[/font]
