This small mod allows Khajiit and Argonian Followers who use the Khajiit and Argonian voices both males and females to become Stewards for the Hearthfire homes and any Hearthfire Compatible Modded Player Homes.
  
  
This mod works with mods like [Relationship Dialogue Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1187) and [Vanilla Voice Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8451). And should work for vanilla followers like Kharjo, J'zargo and Derkeethus.
  
  
Simply take a Khajiit or Argonian follower to a Hearthfire home (must have at least the small house built) and they should have the dialogue option asking if they are interested in being a Steward available.
  
  
Once you have asked the follower to be a Steward you must dismiss them and then the normal Steward dialogue for house improvements, buying supplies etc. will be available.
  
  
Note: As the there is no audio for Khajiit and Argonian Hearthfire dialogue their **dialogue is silent/unvoiced**, but does function correctly. Not a requirement but I recommend using the [Fuz Ro Doh](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15109) mod. Also the NPC response dialogue text is sometimes very fast but their Steward functions will still work.
  
  
Mod is ESL Flagged.
  
  
Khajiit and Argonian followers are from [More Kats of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31743) and [More of Argonians of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33436/)[Oldrim LE Version](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/109984)[Xbox Version ﻿ ﻿](https://bethesda.net/en/mods/skyrim/mod-detail/4246484)[PS4 Version](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/details/7ed3f59d-07fe-4158-9ec9-ae0d9852c5d5/Khajiit_Argonian_Steward_Fix_PS)
