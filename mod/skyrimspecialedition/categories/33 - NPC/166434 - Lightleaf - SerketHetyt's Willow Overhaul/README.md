A Bosmer far from the forests of Valenwood, [*Willow*](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/166289)﻿ is a lovely bosmer born and raised in Skyrim. Cheerful, spirited, and offering his companionship at a perfect price of absolutely nothing, he’s determined to show he can be more than just a novice adventurer. ?
  
As a long-time fan of *[Taliesin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/124589)﻿*, I was thrilled when **DynamiteGal124** shared a teaser of Willow. He was instantly charming, his lines, his energy, everything about him made me want him by my side in my adventures. With that in mind, and with the help of **WeelBones**, I created this replacer.
  
  
Since Willow isn’t a Bosmer from Valenwood and doesn’t follow the Green Pact, I chose to give him a simpler look, no leaves woven into his antlers, no green hues in his skin. Still, I kept several key features that tie him to his original design, such as his hair and eye colors and his freckled Bosmeri complexion. I went with a similar hairstyle too: short, slightly messy, and absolutely perfect for his bright, lively personality. And unlike [*Auri*](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/164144)﻿’s sharp teeth, Willow has a sweet little gap that, in my opinion, makes him even more adorable. [/font][font=Georgia]I aimed to preserve his spirit and hints of his original appearance while adding a touch of my own style. [/font][font=Georgia]???

[font=Georgia]**Details, requirements and important info:**
> ![](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/c9f6b605da71.gif)﻿[font=Georgia]The plugin is **flagged as ESL**.
>   
>   
> [/font]![](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/c9f6b605da71.gif)This time I didn't gave him a custom body, which means the body is with vanilla path and will use whatever bodyslide you have installed. If you want suggestions, I can point you to my bodyslide for HIMBO ([The Common Guy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/111807)﻿﻿) that is what you see in my pictures. I use HIMBO + The New Gentleman in my own game.
>   
>   
> ![](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/c9f6b605da71.gif)I did my best to avoid the most hideous clippings in his hair with ears and horns, but it isn't perfect so... Life goes on.
>   
>   
> ![](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/c9f6b605da71.gif)My Willow also has different weight from original. If you are installing my mod in an existing save, I recommend use [Save Unbaker](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85565)﻿ to avoid neckseam and other issues.
>   
> [font=Georgia]
>   
> ![](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/c9f6b605da71.gif)﻿He will use his default armor. If you are looking for something we used in the screenshots, scroll down to the bottom of this modpage's description. **Please avoid asking in the comments things that I answered here, thanks.**
>

> ![](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/c9f6b605da71.gif)**Main file** requires [B.E.E.S](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441)﻿ (if you are in an old version of the game).
>   
>   
> ![](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/c9f6b605da71.gif)I don’t use **RSV**, but I added the keyword **RSVignore** to the plugin**.** In Willow's original modpage you have a sticky post with instructions about setting it properly to avoid RSV changing his skin. Again, **I don't use this mod**, so I can't help much with more than that. Same goes with **OBody**. Both mods have all the necessary info in their modpages.
>   
>   
> ![](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/c9f6b605da71.gif)**I can’t provide support for issues caused by your specific load order**. This mod is standalone and has been tested by at least three people and it’s working as intended, anything beyond that **is on your end**. Please read the mod pages of your other mods before coming to mine claiming this one isn’t working.

> [font=Georgia]**![](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/c9f6b605da71.gif)I won't provide presets.** This is a NPC replacer, not your player character. Please be respectful and **don't ask me about that in comments, DMs or Discord ❌**
>   
>   
> ![](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/c9f6b605da71.gif)This mod was made for myself, so I won't be taking requests and I don't do commissions (paid or not). **There won't be special versions of this character tailored for your personal liking**, as, again, this mod was made for my own game according to my preferences. I would also appreciate if you keep unsolicited suggestions and nitpick for yourself.

> ❌**You are not allowed**❌ to do modifications for redistribution of this character or its assets (publicly or privately). This includes: de-standalone versions, bodyslide or skin edits, and any modifications big or small (Skypatcher, xEdit or any way to use that character's face in another character). **All assets must remain inside this mod**, as required by the original permissions from other mod authors, and I intend to respect the authors’ wishes, as you should do as well.

> [/font][font=Georgia]❗❗ If you want to make a patch or translation, **contact me via Nexus DMs first**. Written permission is required before publishing anything. I’ll most likely grant you permission (with my mod set as a requirement), but contacting me first allows me to keep track of what’s being done with my work and for why, and also provides you with proof of authorization for your own peace of mind. ❗❗
>   
>   
> **![](https://cdn.imgchest.com/files/c9f6b605da71.gif)I respectfully ask that you don't use my mods for NSFW thumbnails, and that NSFW images not be uploaded to this modpage.** These mods were not created with that purpose in mind, and there’s plenty of content on Nexus designed for that. Please be respectful, as seeing this kind of misuse is genuinely demotivating.

> **❗❗ I host and maintain my mods exclusively on Nexus Mods** ❗❗
>   
>   
> If you find them anywhere else, it’s not my responsibility and it means my permissions, as well as those of other authors, have been violated. **Don’t support disrespectful content thieves masquerading as “Robin Hood Community Saviors"**, as their entitlement, harassment, and baseless insults to mod authors are a big part of why many are leaving the modding scene and no longer releasing their work publicly, which is a loss for all players, including you and me.[/font]
