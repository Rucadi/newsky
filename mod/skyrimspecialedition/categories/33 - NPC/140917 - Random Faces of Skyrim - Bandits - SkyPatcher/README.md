**What does this mod do?**
  
Tired of bandits always looking the same? Random Faces of Skyrim – Bandits shuffles their faces, races, and appearances, making use of all available vanilla presets. This is possible with thanks to the brand-new [SkyPatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106659)﻿ feature.
  
  
This mod ensures that bandits spawn with different looks, adding variety to your encounters. The appearances are saved with your save file, meaning they will remain consistent when loading the game!
