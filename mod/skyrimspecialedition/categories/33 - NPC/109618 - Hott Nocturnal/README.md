**This is simply a visual replacer for Nocturnal, the mysterious Daedric Prince
  
who you meet all-too-briefly at the end of the Thieves' Guild questline.
  
She is voluptuous and pale, and you can see the night sky through her body.
  
  
There is also a standalone follower version available,
  
summonable via a tiny statue right outside the Twilight Sepulcher.
  
  
Her outfit can be crafted and upgraded, and the hood
  
has an enchantment that applies the starry visual effect.****﻿ ﻿To get the follower: 
  
Go to the Twilight Sepulcher (console cheat = coc twilightsepulcherexterior) and look in the rocks just to the right of the front door for a tiny statue of Nocturnal. Activating this will give you the normal buff for interacting with Nocturnal's shrine, but it is also an on/off switch for the follower. She will appear in the weeds nearby. She is a standard vanilla follower, a lightning mage with some decent perks, and can be married. Hitting the little shrine again will make her disappear. You can do this as many times as you feel like. 
  
Lore-wise it obviously makes no sense for the Daedric Prince Nocturnal to follow you around and help you carry your luggage, but if you like, you can pretend she is a crazy cosplaying mage who bears a resemblance. [b][color=#9fc5e8]
  
She uses the dark elf voice because it's the same voice actress as Nocturnal and has standard follower dialogue.
  
In combat she uses an armor spell that makes her starry sky visual more pronounced. She turns invisible when sneaking.**
  
This mod is pretty open to customizing if you want to swap in your own body meshes or textures. The follower has the starry sky effect attached to a spell, so you can change her body or outfit and she will still look cool. She includes her own body mesh and textures that are UNP-based. UNP is not required for the mod, but she might look weird in CBBE clothes. If you leave her in that outfit she will look like the screenshots. 
  
  
 ﻿To craft the outfit: 
  
You will need some moonstone ingots. Otherwise it's pretty easy, no special requirements. It's UNP based. The hood has the hair included. The robe has no enchantment so you can do what you like with it. You can always put this outfit on a different UNP-based follower or on yourself.
  
Her clothes will use your installed textures for the Nocturnal robes. I very highly recommend [Rustic Clothing](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4703)!
  
  
 ﻿To meet the real Nocturnal:
  
Play through the entire Thieves Guild storyline, and try not to blink at the end!
