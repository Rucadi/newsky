# Izela Clovermist - Corbicanus Armor Boss Integration
- Author: Ecskrillos
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/100498


The idea came from the insatiable thirst for satisfaction of getting a cool armor mod dropped from a boss, RPG style.
  
  
Most cool armor mods are obtainable by crafting/chests/AIM. Why not make a boss-level NPC that drops said armor? lets go!
  
 
  
This mod basically adds a boss in the world that wears mod armor. Beat the boss, and you get the armor(and a spell pack). Simple as that.
