**Update 3.0**
  
  
[font=Verdana][font=Verdana]**This update includes the following changes:**
  
  

  
* [font=Verdana][font=Verdana]More Body Normal Maps - I have added Natural and Strong body normal maps (for a total of four including the Soft and Muscular).[/font][/font]
More Face Diffuse Textures - I've added two more face textures. Hardened and aging.
  
* More Face Normal Maps - A mature normal map for the face was added.

  
Records were made to allow me to use the above features in the plugin for the asset pack. Some old records were removed.
  
  
***Note:** Although this was tested, and 99% of all Visions mod should have no issue with this update, there may be some very early Visions mods that need a patch. Let me know if you run into and issues and I'll patch them quickly.*[/font][/font]
  
**Update 2.3** 
  
  
[font=Verdana][font=Verdana]Combines all the previous updates into the main archive of each body type, doing away with having to grab a separate update patch. Also fixes the problem with the head normal map not having a symmetrical eye socket. **Replace previous version completely when installing.**[/font][/font]
  
  
**Update 2.2** 
  
  
[font=Verdana][font=Verdana]This is a small update meant to be applied to 2.1. It is not a main file and not meant to replace 2.1, but to add to it. Those of you removing 2.1 to install the update are basically removing most the assets you need in the asset pack and the plugin as well. Install the update by adding the files to 2.1 (with MO2 that means use the merge feature). This update basically adds a couple textures to make the lips look better.[/font][/font]
  
  
**Update 2.1** 
  
[font=Verdana]
  
[font=Verdana]Why do this to us Cold?[/font]! Because I'm a perfectionist and I want these Visions mods to be my best work. That said, visual changes are subjective right? I know a lot of people don't even use Visions and prefer my old Pantheon or ColdSun's World designs (even know they are technically not built as well as my Visions mods). This update to the Asset Pack marks a major change in the assets due to using a different skin. At this point, it is important to remember any of the Visions mods updated on or after 6/4/2024 will require Asset Pack version 2.1+.
  
  
Also, keep in mind that when you update the asset pack, all followers and replacers that use it will use these new assets (skins).
  
  
[/font]

  
* [font=Verdana]The new default skin for Visions is now [Reverie](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64314)﻿ 1.11+. [Novelyst](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/100685828)﻿ has done an amazing job on this skin and it fits the aesthetic I'm looking for with my designs. I still love BNP, but for Visions, I'll be using Reverie.[/font]
[font=Verdana]Extra Matte addons were removed as they are now included by default with the Reverie version in 2.1.[/font]
  
* [font=Verdana]Updated the new skin I added to 2.0 with a special blend of Reverie.[/font]
[font=Verdana]All optional addons have been updated to the new Reverie 2.1 skin (all muscle, all soft, body hair)[/font]
  

  
[font=Verdana]**I deeply apologize for another update, and one so important, so soon since 2.0 was released. This should be the last update to the Asset Pack for some time.**[/font]
  
  
**Update 2.0** 
  
[font=Verdana]
  
[/font]

  
* [font=Verdana][/font][font=Verdana]Added a new skin - the asset pack now has two different skins. This allows me to get different looking characters depending on what I want to design. Skin 1 (the original one included in 1.0) is based on BNP 1.7. Skin 2 is BNP 2.0 using the extra matte addon.[/font]
[font=Verdana]Extra Matte addons for 3BA-CBBE-TBD and BHUNP-UNP for Skin 1.[/font]
  
* [font=Verdana]Expanded the Body Hair and All Soft or All Muscle patches to include Skin 2.[/font]
[font=Verdana]This update is safe to install mid-game and doesn't effect existing followers or replacers at all.[/font]
  
* [font=Verdana]Expect new followers and replacers that use the new Skin 2 option to show up after 5/3/2024. Just remember, not all of them will use the new skin. It depends on which skin I feels match the design better.[/font]

[font=Verdana]The Visions Asset Pack is the next generation of my modding series. It is also the last series I will create. To be honest, I thought I was done with series when I created Pantheon, but there were a lot of improvements to make and I wanted to change how things were done as well. Thank you for your patience as I continue to improve my mods.
  
[/font]
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/Pthm5PT.png)
  
[font=Verdana]The Visions Asset Pack includes an ESL-Flagged plugin that further combines assets that are used over and over again. This will save a ton of space on your hard drive and also provide better game performance. If you by chance checked how big all nine Pantheon Packs were when installed and then checked what I did with this mod and the Vision NPCs you would clearly see its taking up a fraction of the space it did before.[/font]
  
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/syYBgQj.png)
  
[font=Verdana]All NPC Replacers and Followers that use the Visions Asset Pack will use my skin and assets but the body you have installed on your system. No more bodyslide files and much better support for [obody](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77016). [/font]
  
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/qIk9YxQ.png)
  
[font=Verdana]The skin in the Visions Asset Pack is [Reverie](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64314) 1.11+ by [Novelyst](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/100685828). It will support players that use 3BA,CBBE, BHUNP, TBD or UNP (make sure you download the correct Asset Pack for your body type). Again, it will use your own default body you have installed.[/font]
  
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/gsxncdP.png)
  
[font=Verdana]All NPCs and Followers have unique hair color records in the plugin as well. This means that wigs should better match the color of their default hair as well as 3D body hair mods that support that feature. Sometimes the colors can be slightly off depending on the diffuse texture of the wig, but this will be closer than any other replacer out there. [/font]*[font=Verdana]Note: White and Red hair has problems matching up in the engine. There is nothing I can really do about it.[/font]*
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/xQt7L9C.png)
  
[font=Verdana]I will be adding useful records to the Asset Pack plugin over time, but you can always upgrade it mid-save without any worry of causing problems in your game and it is compatible with every other mod, even my older series of replacers like ColdSun's World and Pantheon. I will always state clearly in the changelog when I make updates and what the updates were.
  
[/font]
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/nGgppbx.png)
  
[font=Verdana]The body diffuse texture has no body hair. This is good for folks using 3D body hair mods. That said, there is a patch for 3BA-CBBE and BHUNP-UNP for folks who want body hair included on the skin itself. Just download that and overwrite and you are all set.
  
  
There is also a couple patches for folks who only want mucular NPCs and Followers, or only want Soft. This will overwrite one or the other assets so every follower or NPC Replacer from Visions uses all of one or the other. Otherwise, I choose what the Follower or NPC Replacer will use based on their class or job in the game. If they are a warrior type, they have muscles. If they are a tavern maid, they are soft. And so on.

[font=Verdana]I'll be posting some guides in the Articles tab of this mod. Please check there for some other features and extra support. Some of the guides you will find there:

![](https://i.imgur.com/XSzTBUb.png)[/font][font=Verdana]**I welcome polite and constructive feedback.  However - rude/passive-aggressive comments, insulting or disparaging any author's work or mine will result in an immediate and permanent ban from my mod pages.  Be respectful in your comments.**[/font] **[font=Verdana]Comments will be left open, but there will be limited support provided there. Please go to our [/font]**[font=Verdana][Discord](https://discord.gg/JrpPh6F2tu)[/font]**[font=Verdana] Server for support, or visit the above mentioned guides in the Articles tab.[/font]**

* [font=Verdana]Download the Asset Pack for the body type that you use (3BA-CBBE or BHUNP-UNP).[/font]
[font=Verdana]The Asset Pack does not conflict with any other mods and no vanilla records are touched in the plugin. This means it will not conflict with anything else, including my previous mods.[/font]
  
* [font=Verdana]To Update the Asset Pack, download the newer version and **replace it** (*do not merge it*). It is completely safe to update it mid-game.[/font]
[font=Verdana]Since the Asset Pack doesn't conflict with other mods, it can be anywhere in your load order, but as a best practice I always put it right above all the other Visions mods and follow the instructions according to the Visions Follower and Replacer mods in regards to load order.[/font]

[font=Verdana]As mentioned in the comment policy, support is limited on this mod page and the comments section. Please use the Articles Tab Guides first, then head on over to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/JrpPh6F2tu) if you still have problems. These mods change looks only, and have been highly tested before release.  Placed properly in the load order, they work as expected. Most issues can be resolved by load order adjustment, re-downloading either the asset pack, mod or both, or by creating a custom patch.
