Filling in the Blanks tackles the NPC face reuse issue at the source by directly editing NPC faces who use the generic face for their race. A method that I feel adds diversity to the pool without adding a ton of additional NPCs. Generic NPCs covered are Bandits, Reavers, Vampires, Thalmor, Afflicted, Warlocks, Guards, Forsworn, and more. I also fixed the proportions on some of the more ridiculous NPCs in the generic pool.
  
  
In addition, in the Townie plugin, I added unique faces to certain named NPCs without them. These fixes are meant to be used in conjunction with a full vanilla head NPC Overhaul such as Nordic Faces or Diversity by loading after them. Though the included FaceTints were made to match Nordic Faces specifically.
  
  
All of these changes come courtesy of [NVICO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48821), so if you’re looking for a High Poly Head version of this mod, head over there.**Now, let me go over the options:**
  
  
- Filling in the Blanks – Bandits: Covers Generic NPCs
  
- Filling in the Blanks – Townies: Covers Named NPCs with generic faces such as Erikur, Briehl, Gilfre, Valga Vinicia, etc.
  
  
- New Guard Recruits: Adds 72 additional Nord faces to the guard pool. Female guards will now patrol Imperial-controlled cities.
  
  
  
**Each of these options comes in two different versions:**- EFM or Expressive FaceGen Morphs, which is most similar to Nordic Faces and newer NPC Overhauls
  
 - Vanilla Morphs, which are used by Diversity, WICO, and older NPC Overhauls**Patches Provided For:**- AI Overhaul (Townies Only)
  
- OBIS
  
- SRCEO
  
- Improved Bandits**Requirements**- USSEP (Hard Requirement)
  
- Expressive Facial Animations Male and Female (Not Required - Highly Recommended for EFM version)
  
- Expressive FaceGen Morphs (Not Required - Highly Recommended for EFM version)**Neat Little Statistics I Found Out While Making This Mod:**- There are only 21 unique Reaver faces for the 200 Reavers NPCs in the game
  
- Afflicted are even worse with only 1 male face and 1 female face for 120 NPCs
  
- 7 Thalmor females share the same face
  
- There are 18 total guard faces with only 3 being female
  
  
  
**FAQ:****Q**. Why go through the effort of making this?
  
**A**. Bad Sims 3 memories. I feel no game is more guilty of the crime of repetitive faces than that one.
  
  
**Q**. Will this mod completely eliminate repeated bandit faces?
  
**A**. No, not on its own due to how the vanilla game spawning system works. It will vastly reduce it, however. To completely eliminate it, you’ll need a mod that adds new bandits to the pool, such as Heritage, OBIS, or 2335 Extra Enemies.
  
  
**Q**. NPCs in the Vanilla Morphs version are UGLY!!!
  
**A**. It’s vanilla, lad. NPCs were made with EFM morphs in mind, and those don’t transfer 1:1 with the vanilla morphs.
  
  
**Q**. Can I switch between the EFM and Vanilla versions?
  
**A**. Yes, they’re completely interchangeable.
  
  
**Q**. Any of them KS or Apachii Hairs?
  
**A**. Nope.
  
  
**Q**. Any crazy stat having enemies that will one-shot me?
  
**A**. Nope, no stats have been altered or touched.
  
  
**Q**. Are the plugins cleaned?
  
**A**. Super clean. No edits beyond appearances. ESP-FE formatfor main files and patches.
  
  
**Q**. Optimization?
  
**A**. The textures are all BC7 to retain quality. High Poly Vanilla Hair was omitted until the author fixes some problems with the meshes, so all new heads match vanilla in poly count.
  
  
**Q**. Can I swap the tintmasks?
  
**A**. No, you’ll get a neckseam. It’s better to regenerate them in the Creation Kit instead.
  
  
**Q**. Bandits seem much cleaner than before. Why?
  
**A**. On the whole, they aren’t, but better textures can make it seem that way. Some of them may have also decided to wash and take a bath.
  
  
**Q**. Why include this section?
  
**A**. All the cool mod authors are doing it. No, but really, I always enjoy seeing these little FAQ sections at the bottom of mod pages. It’s a little reward for those who take the time to fully read the mod pages of the mod they’re about to install.
