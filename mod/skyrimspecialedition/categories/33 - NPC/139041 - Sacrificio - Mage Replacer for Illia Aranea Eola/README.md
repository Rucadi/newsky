Just another replacer trio from me, hope you guys like it! Please let me know if making plugins for each NPC is fine or should i merge them in one for the next works.
  
  
I have updated right now my last 2 mods trying to keep improving the quality of those so make sure to check them out specially if you use the asset option.[/left]
  
  
FAQ: 
  
  
  
***"They have a black face/are bald"***
  
  
Check that nothing is overwriting the mod or the plugin, if you have Synthesis in your modlist then try to run it so it forwards the changes, or place my replacers plugins after the synthesis ones, first option is recommended or alternatively a patch.
  
  
  
***"They have a neck seam/gap"***
  
  
if you added my replacer midsave then thats probably why, your save already had another weight value for that NPC and my mod changes that, causing the neck problem.
  
  
I recommend having that save unbaker mod or do the following with console commands:
  
  
- Open console and target the NPC
  
- Type and enter these: "setnpcweight X" (X is the weight listed at the bottom of the steps)
  
- Followed by "disable" and then "enable"
  
- Save your game and she should be fine now, if this doesn't solve it make sure to let me know.
  
  
Weights: Illia 39, Aranea 30, Eola 30.
  
  
***"They look different from your pictures"***
  
  
This depends heavily on the skin mod you are using, and of course the ENB can influence it too, for these screenshots i use BnP 2.0 and a tweaked PI-CHO ENB, they will have the same skin if choosing D7 Asset option in the FOMOD (make sure to get it from requirements)
  
  
***"I dont like something about the NPC, would you change it for me?"***
  
  
Probably not, i might comeback to tweak some facial features but thats about it.
  
  
***"Compatible with x mod?"***
  
  
If that mod touches the npc records then you will need a patch, you can mention that to me in the comments and ill see if i have time to create one for it.
