**﻿[u]DESCRIPTION

[/u]**

New powerful enemies added to Skyrim and Solstheim - battle fallen and corrupted knights, warriors, and other beings from various orders and cults of The Elder Scrolls throughout your journey.
  
  
Prove your mettle and reap the rewards.  
  
  
Oh, and be prepared to die. *A lot*. (maybe)
  
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

**FEATURES**

**15 new, powerful enemies**
  

  
* For you to fight all over Skyrim and Solstheim
They are **tough**; loaded with spells, special artifacts, weapons, and armors. They also scale according to the player's level.
  
* Through the power of *SkyPatcher* they are integrated to several enemy leveled lists, so you can fight them **countless of times**.
**So where can you find them?** You may find them walking the roads around Skyrim, sometimes out in the wild. Some of them may accost you, or some will mind their own business - be warned though they will defend themselves if you invade their personal space! 
  
* Take note that these NPCs should be**rare**, so don't expect them to pop up in every corner of Skyrim (at least, I should hope so). A separate plugin for handplaced/guaranteed spawn will be provided.
Some of these NPCs come with their own armors and weapons and some are from leveled lists (different sets of armors at certain levels). 
  

**New spoils for you to loot**: 
  

  
* Armors, weapons, summoning tomes, ingredients, miscellaneous items and various relics/artifacts﻿
Some are basic stuff, nothing too crazy. Most of these items are integrated into their own leveled lists, and are *quite rare*. 
  

**A couple of NPCs for you to meet and greet.**
  

  
* Find them - one happens to wander around Skyrim *as is their nature* and another stares broodingly towards the Red Mountain in Solstheim
Try to *be nice* to them.
  

**The List of NPCs you will be encountering**
  

  
* The following listed are NPCs and around least possible level they are at upon encountering them (backstory further down the page as to what/who they are):

  
1. Wayward Evermore Knight (Lvl 15)
Dishonorable Housecarl (Lvl 20) 
  
2. Banished Order of the Candle Knight (Lvl 20)
Extinguished Lamp Knight (Lvl 25)
  
3. Exiled Orc Warrior (Lvl 30)
Withered Knight of the Thorn (lvl 30)
  
4. Broken Blades (lvl 35)
Shame of Alkosh (lvl 40)
  
5. Forsaken Ordinator (lvl 40)
Disgraced Welkynar Apprentice (Lvl 40)
  
6. Forgotten Dreamer (Lvl 45)
Fallen Ascended Sleeper (lvl 50)
  
7. Lost Hand of Almalexia (Lvl 55)
Nameless Heartwight  (Lvl 60)
  
8. Frenzied Nisswo-King (lvl 65)

  
**REMEMBER:** It's okay to run away from a fight you can't win; maybe it's not your time yet and there's always next time.

[SkyPatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106659)
  
* ﻿OPTIONAL: [HIMBO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46311)﻿

**INSTALLATION**1. Install [SkyPatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106659)﻿ and its requirements

3. OPTIONAL if you use **HIMBO**: Don’t forget to run **Bodyslide** for **Ash Vampire Loincloth (HIMBO)**
  
4. Enjoy!
  
  
**UNINSTALLATION**
  
**Not recommended** to uninstall this in the *middle of the playthrough,* otherwise just uninstall the mod.
  
  
**EXPECTED POSSIBLE ISSUES / CONFLICTS**
  

  
* Armors provided for the NPCs are distributed at certain levels, so if you play with mods manipulating level encounters it might compromise their leveling and their corresponding armors they are supposed to have when you reach certain levels.
In regards to leveled lists, there should be no conflicts at all as SkyPatcher will take care of it. 
  

 [/left][left]**SPECIAL NOTES**
  

  
* **SkyPatcher templates** for *NPC face changing*, *weapons changing*, and *Outfit changing* are provided, just follow the instructions and examples in their respective .ini files should you want to change them.
The .ini files provided are completely configurable to however you like should you decide to tweak them.
  

  
**FEEDBACKS**
  
This mod is by no means perfect so feedbacks are welcome. I'm always looking for better ways to improve: 
  
  
**Difficulty**
  

  
* Too hard? Too easy? Just right? It's difficult for me to account for every modlists out there. It may be hard in your game or it may be easy - let me know. Share better ways to get this as close as *modlist-proof* as possible

**Spawn spots/leveled list integration:** 
  

  
* I'm going to be honest - this is where I struggled the most, so if you got any ideas of a better implementation that can be done with SkyPatcher/xEdit send them my way.

**Armor/weapons/tomes/Misc items:**
  

  
* Overpowered? Lackluster? Well, just sell them I guess. I've put some values on these items (Think of them as job well done for slaying them.
Let me know if you think certain objects should have better implementation in regards to anything.

**A BIT OF BACKSTORY / LORE(ish)**

  
So what or who are these beings? Some of them are already familiar to to you but I provided some info on them nonetheless, **with a bit of personal touch**. Lore friendly? Well, that's always up for question - *you decide*.
  
  
Wayward Evermore Knights 
  
*Former knights of [St. Pelin](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Order_of_Saint_Pelin) who shirked from fulfilling their duties, now embraces a life without oath and shackles.* 
  
﻿Broken Blades
  
*Despite being disbanded and hunted into near obscurity by the Thalmor, the [Blades](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Blades) are still exceptional warriors and pose as formidable adversaries should you encounter them.*Banished Knight of Order of the Candle
  
*A former knight from the [Order of the Candle](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Order_of_the_Candle) whose purpose is to protect the Kingdom of Sentinel of Hammerfell.*
  
  
Dishonorable Housecarls 
  
*They were supposed to have jarls and thanes' backs, guard them with their lives, and [carry their burden](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Housecarl)﻿ - now they roam Skyrim without a purpose, perhaps due to unspeakable acts committed that they were banished from the service. Are they even considered housecarls anymore?*
  
  
Disgraced Welkynar Apprentice
  
*An apprentice on the cusp of becoming a [Welkynar Knight](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Welkynars) suddenly had her destiny wrestled away from her. She is still a force to be reckoned with.*
  
  
Exiled Orc Warrior 
  
*An argument gone wrong with fellow orsimers, with a [blood price](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Orc#:~:text=Orcs%20have%20elven%20blood%2C%20but,than%20uncivilized%20beasts%2C%20savage%20barbarians.)﻿ too steep to pay - what choice is left but to run away? They 'exiled'* *themselves because they knew there was no coming back.*
  
  
Extinguished Lamp Knight
  
*Once the* [protectors](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Order_of_the_Lamp) *of the Mages Guild, now wander aimlessly after its dissolution.*
  
  
Withered Knight of the Thorn 
  
*A dark elf who used to hail from [Cheydinhal's knightly order](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Knights_of_the_Thorn#:~:text=The%20Knights%20of%20the%20Thorn,related%20to%20the%20Indarys%20family.)﻿. What led them astray from the order could be anyone's guess, but they've seen it all: The Oblivion Gates, the Hero of Kvatch - few experiences not many could boast, even for a Knight of the Thorn.*
  
Forsaken Ordinator
  
*Hailed from the [warriors](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Ordinators) that used to serve the since long gone Tribunal Temple. The Tribunal may have turned their gazes away from him but his might and magic certainly have not.*Shame of Alkosh
  
*A Khajiti who once belonged to a [clan of warriors](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Pride_of_Alkosh#:~:text=The%20Pride%20of%20Alkosh%20is,known%20as%20the%20Forgotten%20Manes.) dedicated to defending Elsweyr. Will they be back in Alkosh’s graces someday?*Forgotten Dreamer
  
*[Fanatics](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Dreamer_(NPC)) who wear nothing but faith and have eyes only for Dagoth Ur.*Fallen Ascended Sleeper
  
*Is it a dunmer? Is it an [abomination](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Ash_Creatures)? No matter, it will simply destroy you. Be prepared.*Nameless Heartwight
  
*An [ash vampire](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Ash_Vampire) whose brother and great house are long gone. Are there any reasons left for its existence?*Lost Hand of Almalexia
  
*Once considered the [greatest warriors](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Tribunal:Hands_of_Almalexia#:~:text=The%20Hands%20of%20Almalexia%20are,weapons%20bear%20fearsome%20divine%20enchantments.) in Morrowind, but what is strength without true purpose?*Frenzied Nisswo-King
  
*An awakened [Nisswo](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Nisswo) vampire from a bygone era. What lies await for this priest-king of Sithis?*
