[font=Georgia]This is an add-on of Immersive World Encounters which boosts the appearance of its unique NPCs by using highpoly head meshes and various facial assets.
  
  
This mod requires the latest version of Immersive World Encounters: Final (Version 3.0 and up).
  
  
Please beware that the face textures and body textures are not included; this is NOT a standalone NPC replacer (for now, I might make them standalone with their own designated body & face textures upon receiving such requests) and will inherit the appearance of whatever textures you are using for the NPCs' facial and body textures. The textures for their eyes, eyebrows, mouth, hair, and other facial traits are included.
  
  
In the screenshots, I am using [Bijin Skin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/91953) for the female NPCs and [SkySight Skins](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58443) for the male NPCs. [/font]
