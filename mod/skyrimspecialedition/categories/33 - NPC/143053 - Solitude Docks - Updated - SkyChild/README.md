Solitude Docks Updated expands the area outside Solitude near the docks with new buildings and 33 new NPCs, including 2 Nord Children, Skjrta and Radin.
  
  
Solitude Docks Updated - High Poly NPCs changes the apperance of the adult NPCs, making them on par with many avalible NPC overhauls  covering  the NPCs in and around Solitude.
  
  
SkyChild gives the children inside and on the farm outside the city the High Poly apperance treatment.
  
  
But neither covers the 2 new children, so I made this Patch to fix that.
