v.250214 The Mail Terminator Update
  
This update will prevent couriers from dying. Though the essential flag is being ignored on these lvledlist NPCs, the additional script will make sure they keep
  
delivering the mail.
  
  
As of v.220107 The Courier Crew is now compatible w/ courier replacer mods. Such as Vander Nightbrook, Lilly, or the pretty boy courier replacer, Dapper Deliveries etc. Just make sure to load those mods after The Courier Crew.

Skald's Mail is compatible
  
  
in addition to the original Nord Courier with MaleYoungEager voiceset. All new voices were created with XVAsynth
  
  
Now couriers, randomly selected will deliver messages and packages all over Skyrim. I outfitted the couriers to look a little more formidable since they are suppose to be delivering things throughout the holds rather then looking like they just crawled out from working in the city sewer.
  
  
I started using the Mods "Honed Metal" & "Order My Items" where the courier is seen more frequently and wanted at least a female courier because you know, I like girls.
