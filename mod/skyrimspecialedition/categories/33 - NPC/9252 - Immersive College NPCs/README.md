**IMMERSIVE COLLEGE NPCS**
  
  
**[SomethingObscure](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/598980) is now co-author of this mod, since I won't have the time or equipment to work on it at this time.
  
  
(There is now a version for the XBOX One)**
  
  
If you're anything like me and love playing a mage, then you've probably visited the College of Winterhold...
  
  
Maybe you came to Special Edition thinking you'd be able to run around Hogwarts, the Arcane University, or [Immersive College of Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17004)? (Awesome mod for the original Skyrim.) Did you notice a lack of security? Perhaps you wondered where all the workers at Saarthal went or why they didn't care to defend their little project? A lack of students? (Come on Bethesda! 3 students? It's a college!)
  
  
I searched the web for mods that might change this in a way that wasn't immersion breaking, but ended up making my own mod. Now they take security a bit more seriously, and Students feel safe enough to stay at the College.
  
  
**WHAT THIS DOES**
  
  
It adds a bunch of NPCs to the College as well as Saarthal Exterior. They all have things to do and will wander around and use idles/furniture and workstations.
  
  
**I also HIGHLY RECOMMEND** you check out [Obscure's College of Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20514)﻿. This adds dorms for all the npcs in this mod as well as some realistic touches for even more immersion!
  
  
No unique dialogue atm! Will probably implement soon!

UPDATES
  
Version 1.1.0
  

  
* This new version has been reformatted as an ESP-FE plugin, which essentially makes it a new mod.  Because of this it's been renamed to ICNs\_ImmersiveCollegeNPCs.esp to avoid confusion between the two versions.  All existing patches have been updated and renamed as well.
Because ICNs contained only NPCs, AI schedules, and markers, switching from the old version to the ESP-FE version should have no effect on your save game.
  
* Please check out the full change log in the drop-down in the menus at the top of this page, or by clicking on the version number before downloading the file.
A new "Lite" version patch is now offered for those who had framerate troubles in the Courtyard due to Atronachs.  Please let us know if this helps.
  
* Character Facegeoms and Tintmasks have been built with the following resources: [Ultimate Eye Meshes Ruhmastered](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18147), [Better Makeup for SKSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/31665), [ENB Brow Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18783), and [Seamless Males](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19164).
All conflicts with USSEP and Immersive College of Winterhold have been resolved.  A full compatibility and conflicts list is forthcoming. 
  

  
Version 1.0.4
  

  
* Fixed issues with missing FaceGen files. Now the faces should work for everyone!

  
Version 1.0.3
  

  
* Cleaner mod
More NPCs
  
* Requested Outfit changes
Better schedules
  

  
Let me know if you have thoughts, advice or want to see something implemented! Also, please **Endorse** if you enjoyed it! :)
  
  
REQUIREMENTS
  
Skyrim Special Edition
  
  
COMPATIBILITY
  
This mod only adds npcs, it does not change any architectural aspects, statics or items. Only used Vanilla assets so it should be compatible with any College mods that do not alter the place dramatically!
  
  
Recommended mods, but not required:
  
[Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266)
  
[The Elder Scrolls - Tomebound](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21403) - Adds more, lore friendly spells!
  
  
Choose one of these three College overhauls!
  
[Obscure's College of Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20514) - Adds much needed realism, bugfixes and dorms for all my npcs!
  
[Magical College Of Winterhold](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1539) - Adds more magical atmosphere, clutter, furniture and improves dorms
  
[Immersive College of Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17004) - Adds a ton of new content, a vast underground, and a new quest!
  
  
P.S!
