This is a simple conversion of the Argonian adoptable kid mod for Ram-Ku. It has all of the issues as the original and I have no ability to edit them, but it has been tested and works like the original. Credit to [hl84](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3084906) of course for making the mod in the first place, and [Langeston](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/53956772) for his porting walk-through, highly recommend it.

About:
  
  
The young traveler Ram-Ku comes from the mysterious Black Marsh, a land far far away from Skyrim. One destined day the old captain of The Sea Squall encountered the Argonian vagabond, and out of the kindness of his heart, allowed him to work as part of the ship's crew. Memories of his blood-splattered past haunt him in slumber; he can still hear the cries of his parents, deafened by the sound of blades as a band of slave hunters butchered them before his very eyes. The young hatchling, fueled by the pain from that which was taken from him, came to the Nordic country in search of the elusive Dark Brotherhood in hopes to join them. Catching wind of their rumored location, he joined The Sea Squall in hopes to track them down and exact his revenge once and for all. However after arriving in Dawnstar, the ship captain mysteriously vanished, presumed dead though unsurprisingly due to his age. No longer under the orders of a captain, half of the crew packed their bags and left in search of work, with the other half taking the reigns of the old Squall, singling out Ram-Ku as a liability and opting to kick him from their ranks.
  
  
Ram-Ku needs help now. He has strong will, but he is still young. What are you going to do with this poor child motivated by his desire for revenge? Will you heal his mind through love and kindness, or train him to achieve his life's dream?

If Using With Child Follower Mod:
  
  
*[If anyone can recommend one for SSE I will link it here.]*He will be the same level as you (he is a brave, eager learner and a very talented boy). He believes in you, so he will not be swayed to attack you even if you commit crimes. Ram-Ku excels at wielding a two-handed weapon and blocking with a shield. He also prefers heavy armor. Despite his age, he likes to maintain a sense of honor, and will not attack anybody unless he himself is attacked.
  
  
  
Known Issues:
  
  
Do not give him child clothes, he cannot wear them. But he can wear every outfit without child clothes, you have to play around with console commands or use other mods that let you access children’s inventories.
  
  
*[The mod author created the below mod that would let you give Ram-Ku clothes, but it is not converted. Feel free to do it yourself.]*
  
Child clothes for adult based children - My little addon: http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/26952
  
  
If you are playing around with an outfit, some of the outfit is going to make a crack between the neck and body. For this, I put a special cloth collar inside of his inventory to hide the cracks.
  
  
[/font][font=Trebuchet MS]If you make him a follower using mods it could have the skill bug that make your follower’s skill value stuck on minimum level. This bug is not from my mod, it’s belongs to game itself. [/font]How to fix:
  
[font=Trebuchet MS]
  

  
1. Open the console command window with tilde ( ~/` key)
Click Ram-Ku to get his reference ID to show in the console command window
  
2. Type "setclass 0001ce15" and press Enter

If you can’t find him on the ship in Dawnstar, try to re-organize your mod order to where he loads later.[/font]
