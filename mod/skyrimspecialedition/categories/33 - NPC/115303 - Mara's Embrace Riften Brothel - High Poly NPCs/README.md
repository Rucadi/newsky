Takes higher poly / resolution heads, brows, hair, and makeup, applying them to the guys and gals in Mara's Embrace, the Riften Brothel. They will continue to use whatever default body and skin textures you have set up. They use KS Hair but continue to use base game hair colors, meaning any hair color replacer you use should work as expected - same goes for the eyes. I intentionally kept this one light on the changes to open up maximum compatibility. They still look nice, but a bit lower class than the ladies at Crimson Corner.
  
  
Pictured with Bijin skin textures (my default).
  
  
Fully compatible with Vanilla, 3BA, CBBE, BHUNP, TBD, HIMBO, and so on - no need for compatibility patches.
  
  
ESL flagged.
