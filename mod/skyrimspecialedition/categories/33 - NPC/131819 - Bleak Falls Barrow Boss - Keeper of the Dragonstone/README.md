*This is one of the mods which adds draugr/priest bosses who implement the Word of Power they guard. Sure, even the original game puts some kind of a boss here, but I wanted something special, something unique. The Dragonstone is guarded at the very end right nearby the Word Wall itself could not be just a coincidence, not to mention the Dragonstone's importance for the Dragon Cult.
  
  
[i][size=4]By default, the mod is de-leveled, but there is an optional file for making this boss leveled.*
  
  
Here is what Keeper of the Dragonstone is capable of with this mod:
  
  
  
[/size][/i]***Earthquake****: Yes, you read it right. Many draugr already have the Shout of Unrelenting Force, including the strong version possessed by Draugr Overlords. So even making some more powerful version of Unrelenting Force Shout is not what I wanted to do. I have decided to implement this Word of Power in a different way, making the Keeper's voice powerful. What the Shout does is aerial stagger along with aerial damage and, well, the Earthquake shaking effect. Yes, you can avoid being affected by it. Duration - 5 seconds; Recovery Time - 20 seconds. But to balance it, I've decided to make it only activate when the Keeper is under 50% of health. And for this reason I also decided to let him use default Unrelenting Force as well, before he can use Earthquake.****Spells****: It's a Dragon Priest, don't forget that. The spells this one has in his arsenal are elemental destruction spells of fire, lightning and frost as combat magic spells, Expel Daedra (self-explanatory), flesh spells like Ebony Flesh for defense and his own unique shadow spell of concentration type he uses for healing and becoming ethereal but dries a lot of magicka per second; kind of "Shadow Escape", call it whatever you want, formally it is just called "Force of Unending Rage and Darkness". He neither uses any summons as allies nor commands your Daedra, but he can raise one of Draugr nearby via Dread Zombie spell.****Strength****:* *stats-wise, he is identical to other elemental Dragon Priests (the ones with no mask) you encounter in the game. The only real difference is arsenal.
  
  
[size=4]**[i]Loot****: he drops two spell tomes, depending on your level (or if you use leveled spells patch). One tome is fire destruction tome, another one is banish or expel Daedra.* [/i][/size]
