A simple mod to distribute AI packages to selected (configurable) NPCs to get them to visit the tavern and shops/houses in Socalista's excellent [Solitude Weaver's Lane](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/119955) mod, for extra immersion.
  
  
I've created a few AI packages so vanilla NPCs in and around Solitude will visit the tavern, bookshop and weaver.
  
  
By default, the mod adds the following packages to the following NPCs;
  
  
**Tavern - 7pm to 12am**Sunday  - Addvar, Bryling, Rorlund
  
Monday - Jala, Hjorunn, Kharag gro-Shurkul
  
Tuesday - Evette San, Sayma, Beirand
  
Wednesday - Ahtar, Katla, Jawanan
  
Thursday - Dorian, Eris, Una
  
Friday - Fihada, Jorn, Illdi
  
Saturday - Vivienne Onis, Erdi
  
  
**Other**
  
Monday - 1pm to 4pm Dorian to bookshop
  
Tuesday -  1pm to 5pm Endarie to weaver (Sebione)
  
Wednesday - 10am to 2pm Erikur to bookshop
  
Thursday - 1pm to 4pm Eris to weaver  (Sebione)
  
Friday  - 1pm to 4pm Greta to bookshop
  
  
You can of course edit the DISTR file by opening it in Notepad or similar to add (or remove) NPCs you want to visit.
  
  
For example if you want to add Heimvar to the Wednesday tavern visit, edit this line and add Heimvar, with a comma, like this;
  
  
; Wednesday Tavern 7pm - 12am
  
Package = 0x803~NPCs Visit Weavers Lane.esp|Ahtar,Katla,Jawanan,**Heimvar**
  
  
If you're adding NPCs, use common sense. Probably best to not put innkeepers, shopkeepers, stall holders etc during their trading hours. Also avoid followers or NPCs with major quests as they may not be where you want them to be. It's best to keep them local too so they have time to travel to their destination.
  
  
You could even add NPCs from other mods, for example if you wanted to add Fironet from Interesting NPCs, just add her name to the relevant line.
  
  
**Notes**
  

  
* The mod is flagged as ESL so it won't take up a slot in your load order and is a very lightweight mod.
The mod was made with the older creation kit so is compatible with all versions of Skyrim SE/AE.
  
* The mod has been tested with **Immersive Citizens** and it is **not**compatible.
The mod has been tested with**AI Overhaul** (full version) and it is compatible.
  
* The mod is safe to install mid-game.
May not be compatible with other mods that assign AI packages to the same NPCs via SPID.
