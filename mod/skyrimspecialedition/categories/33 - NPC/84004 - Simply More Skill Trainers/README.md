# Simply More Skill Trainers

[left]In the base game nearly all skill trainers in Skyrim come with complications, want to train in Block? Too bad, Larak requires you to be Blood-Kin and Njada will only train you if you join the Companions. Restoration? Colette wants you to join the College, Florentius needs you to recruit him for the Dawnguard and Keeper Carcette *dies*.
  
  
This mod rectifies that, it adds a master+ level trainer for every skill around Skyrim with no strings attached, if you have the money they will train you. No guilds, no quests, just cash.
  
  
These trainers have the same rules as regular trainers but they will train your skill to level 100. This is done using a custom trainer class which uses the same vanilla functionality, so in theory this should also be compatible with mods that alter trainer mechanics.
  
  
I've tried to put the actors in places where they *kind* of make sense and you won't be tripping over them, but future updates may put them in more out of the way spots, as well as giving them proper routines so they better blend into the world. They have been placed with gameplay and compatibility in mind, for example trainers that reside inside shops will leave that shop when it closes to keep out of the way of users playing on a thief character.
