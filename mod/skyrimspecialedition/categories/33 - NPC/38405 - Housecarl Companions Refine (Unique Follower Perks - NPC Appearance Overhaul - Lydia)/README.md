**DESCRIPTION**
  
  
Housecarl Companions Refine is a standalone, low-fantasy, and faithful NPC appearance package of the housecarl followers.
  
Housecarl Companions Refine is inspired by the aesthetics of Dragon Age, while incorporating gameplay elements akin to Fallout: New Vegas.
  
  
Instead of overhauling classes, the player is rewarded with a unique, balanced buff for bringing them along in your party.
  
The design isnot meant to disturb the balance of gameplay or features in other mods, and mostly inspire roleplay.
  
This gameplay addon is available as an entirely optional download – separate from the appearance package.
  
  
Changes from Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch and Cutting Room Floor have been forwarded for convenience.
  
However, and in most cases, any mod that edits an Actor record with require a compatibility patch.
