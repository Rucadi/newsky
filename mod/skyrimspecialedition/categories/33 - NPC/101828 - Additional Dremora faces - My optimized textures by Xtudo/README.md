**ADDITIONAL DREMORA FACES**
  
**My optimized textures by Xtudo**

**Description**
  
**My optimized textures for this amazing mod.**
  

  
* Two options available, 2K (optimized original size) and 1K.
Compressed textures with proper mipmaps.
  
* No ESP,  so it's fine to install or uninstall at any time.

  
**I made it for my game and now I'm sharing it, I hope you like it.**
  
**Credits**
