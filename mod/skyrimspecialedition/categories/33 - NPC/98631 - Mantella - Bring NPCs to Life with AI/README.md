See what users on [Discord](https://discord.gg/Q4BJAdtGUE) are saying:
  
  

  
* "Every time I jump in I am **blown away**"

  
* [size=3]"Opens **endless roleplaying** opportunities"
  

  
* "I honestly **never thought** something like this could exist"

  
* "This integration made Skyrim into my **dream game**"

  
* "Absolutely **mind-blowing** mod"

  
* "This truly adds an **amazing level of depth** to Skyrim"

  
* "I asked her what she wanted to be if she couldn't be a blacksmith. She said adventurer. I told her I was one, and that it wasn't all it's cracked up to be, and she asked me why. When she asked me why, **all of a sudden I was just having a conversation**. It felt a lot more real."

  
* "It's so epic to finally be able to **delve into these characters** in a **completely dynamic way**. How many times have you role played this sort of interaction in your head? You can build this relationship with the NPCs that is completely unique. The conversation **evolves and is shaped by you**. The questions you ask, the way you behave and the way you communicate creates a completely unique response from the AI. They truly have been **brought to life**."

**FAQ**
  
**Does Mantella only work in VR?**
  
Mantella is also available for non-VR PC versions of Skyrim (SE / AE).
  
  
**How much does it cost to run Mantella?**
  
Mantella can be run completely for free. If your hardware is able to support running local language models you can run completely offline for free. If you would prefer to outsource this processing externally, you can also connect to many services, with the default being set to OpenRouter:
  
  
OpenRouter: This is Mantella's "default" option when setting up, as OpenRouter offers free models for up to 100 requests a day. The OpenRouter API is billed by using pre-paid credits for the use of paid models. See here for more details: <https://openrouter.ai/docs#models>
  
  
**Are there high PC hardware requirements to run this?**
  
This video showcasing real-time responses was recorded on a laptop without a GPU:
  
  
  
**What are the storage requirements for this mod?**
  
Mantella mod requires ~5GB of space.
  
  
**Does this work with local language models?**
  
[Yes](https://github.com/art-from-the-machine/Mantella#text-generation-webui-free-local-models).
  
  
**What is the Mantella?**
  
The Mantella is an ancient artifact. It was used to power the Numidium, the Brass God. Now it is in your hands.

* Some users have reported that Skyrim crashes when Mantella is used with Fuz Ro D'oh. A potential fix is the disable and re-enable Fuz Ro D'oh
