Description
  
  
Converts [NARC Remade - No Animals Report Crimes for Skyrim SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17946) (along with all of the mod's offered patches) to recordless using SkyPatcher. I have also created a few different versions that one with my tweaks and enhancements and one with only creatures and animals. Each version comes with all the patches so no need to fret!

Installation
  
Install with your mod manager of choice and enjoy!
  
  
Compatibility
  
Should be compatible with everything unless you have a specific mod that only sets some of the flags that this mod does, in which case the .ini from this mod would need to be slightly altered.
  
  
Notes
  
You can customize the INI file before starting your game: search for the name of the faction (FormID, EditorID) and make any changes that you see fit.
