**GENERAL NEWS**
  
**April 1, 2024:** So, not an April Fool joke. I've been working on a new build of the mod for the past few months. To keep my sanity, **I will not be answering questions about this build as it is outdated (6 years old) and the new will build will supersede it**. Currently working on Version 0.3 of the mod, which is a new re-expansion of the Dawnguard dialogue for Serana as well as proper relationship dialogue. Details are in my discord server.
  
  
And to answer everyone's question: USSEP will not be required in the new build.

**What does this mod do?**
  
This mod modifies, fixes and expands Serana's dialogue. The additional dialogues for Serana are fully voiced - utilizing Serana's dialogue pool. The Serana's dialogue expansion goes into Dragonborn and Hearthfire.

**How to install the mod?**
  
If installing from NMM, just click on the mod and let NMM install it. If installing manually, just take the .bsa and .esp files and put them in the data folder for Skyrim. Nothing special. If installing manually, just make sure that the mod is activated in the Data Files when opening Skyrim. If using a previous version of this mod, remove the two files (either through NMN or manual), download the latest version of this mod and install.
  
  
**What is the reason for making this mod?**
  
It started off with fixing a few lines that I felt made Serana a very flat NPC that showed obvious signs that she was rushed by Bethesda. It soon spiraled into the monster that it is today. Mostly, this was meant to be my way of entering into the modding community and learn about the Creation Kit and modding.
