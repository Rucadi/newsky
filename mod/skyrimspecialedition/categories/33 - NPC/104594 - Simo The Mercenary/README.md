If you've been watching Simo at any point, you'd know that the guy is obsessed with mercenaries for some reason.
  
  
Moreover, his community is also obsessed with it. So, you want to see Simo as a mercenary yet again, this time in Skyrim? Here you go then.
  
  
  
This mod comes with 2 versions and serves multiple purposes:
  
  
**Collection Version:** Requires Immersive Collections OR Realm Of Lorkhan starting area mod to work. 
  
**Non-Collection Version:** No requirements. Simo can be found in Whiterun.
  
  
  
**What Does The NPC Provide?**Simo is a very well-voiced and immersive NPC in this mod. Nothing about him being a youtuber etc. is mentioned of course. This is just another mercenary you can come across in Tamriel, with a story of its own.
  
  
For collection users, Simo proves useful in multiple other ways apart from being a voiced NPC:
  
  
First, as a cash-grab method (since he spawns with some cash and the lusty argonian maid book, wink wink).
  
Second as a good pickpocket-skill practice dummy
  
Third, as a combat practice (he has fine combat skills and can be fought with)
