description

  
What this mod does:
  

* Modifies the existing child races in the game to use custom assets: textures, head meshes, body meshes, etc.
 Changes the faces of all children originally existing Skyrim Special Edition
  
* Adds some basic clothing and accessories made from vanilla assets (currently only boys), and a more unique one for Aventus
 (Optional) Includes Nao4288's Female Facial Animation, if you don't want to use the vanilla facial animations included by default. Works with both genders. Download is under "Miscellaneous" - you **don't** need the original files for it to work.

disclaimer

  
Please note that this mod is **NOT** meant to make child races fully playable. It only affects their appearance. Feel free to run around as a child and mess around, kill whatever, etc. However, **playing through any quests as a child isn't the greatest idea**.
  
  
Body meshes include underwear, and revealing parts have been removed from the meshes and textures.

recommended mods

  
[Dovahkinder Collection Replacer](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/45642/?) - Unique clothing retexture for children!
  
[Dreamburrow's freckles](http://dreamburrow.tumblr.com/post/63142128934/quick-post-ill-update-with-news-and-junk-soon#notes) - Totally recommend this if you like dense freckles! This would replace the femaleheaddetail\_frekles2.dds included. In the Data\ folder, create this folder structure and place the file into it with the proper name: textures\actors\character\ranaline\child\femaleheaddetail\_frekles2.dds
  
[Universal Race Scale Remover](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4259/?) - A more compatible alternative to the Size Fix formerly included in the playable version of this mod
  
[Aymar and friends - Adoptable Elven Children](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4847/?) - Adds adoptable Bosmer, Altmer, Orsimer and Dunmer children

incompatible

  
Mods that edit children: Xvision Children, TK Children, etc. as they do the same thing this mod does.
  
Killable children edits the same records as this mod and thus is incompatible. Install the playable version of RSChildren, as it includes the option to kill children as an unintended side effect.
