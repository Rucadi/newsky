*I've had a lot of fun with experimenting with custom textures + go overboard w stuff lately, hehe!* I enhanced an older version (1.0) based of [my older Miraak replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/images/221729)﻿ that I personally made for my own modlist a long time ago.
  
*But then* I recreated him again, cause I was later taught by [Serket](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/serkethetyt/mods?gameId=1704) on how to do custom skin textures + had a random pang of inspo ~~*in the wake of my depressive episode*~~!
  
  
***BTW, BLESS HER SO MUCH FOR HER PICTURES FOR THIS UPDATE - PLEASE CHECK [SERKETHETYT](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/serkethetyt/about-me?gameId=1704) OUT, HER SCREENIES, HER [STORIES](https://serkethetyt.carrd.co/) AND HER [WORK](https://serkethetyt.carrd.co/) IS SO GOOD PLS!***

>   
> ❗For users who came to download Update 2.0.*
>
>   
> * *Update 2.0 Miraakle does not come with Humanlike versions / no Mix N Match for now, as I've honestly had a hard time getting some motivation to come back to Nexus or just generally create.*

  

*This replacer overall was primarily inspired by [swefrida's previous Miraak replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/images/156885)﻿, that is now unfortunately hidden.*

 **˖༺?M I R A A K L E** ~~attempts~~ ~~to stay true to the Vanilla~~ ***SIKE***, there is no absolute Vanilla vision of Miraak, as he has two completely different models that loves to change between 6-7 different NPC references! 
  
[left]Therefore, I have taken the opportunity in creating my own vision(s) of him - making it hopefully more customizable to your tastes! ❤️
  
There are technically two models [u][color=#b6d7a8](?) that are primarily being used for him, however I've replaced every FaceGen BaseID references that he might use[/color][/u], **~~as this GUY CANNOT STOP SHAPESHIFTING.~~**
  
  
  
*If this isn't your vision of Miraak, that's okay! I created them based off of my own modlist, and we all have our own style of NPCs for our modlists. 
  
- No need to jab my stuff! :)
  
  
I've previously used **[Swefrida's Miraak replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/images/156885) (hidden) and [Yassified Miraak](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63479) by [Rayacre](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/59272041) (Vanilla-like)** before getting into making replacers myself, and there are other good ones out there![color=#ead1dc]
  
  
[/color]Note: On [Yassified Miraak's page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63479/), there is a main file that [fixes a navmesh](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63479/) issue (?) in the original Miraak Follower mod, I recommend checking that out!*[color=#ead1dc]
  
[/color]
  
Please do be respectful in the comments. I'm strict in keeping up a safe space, and I don't mind hiding stuff that I don't find pleasant [size=2][color=#d9d2e9]❤️[/color][/size][/left]

[font=Trebuchet MS][size=2]*"But hey, we never see his face anyways what's the point?*" ~~- me after making this~~:[/font]**WELL!** ~~I was having too much free time, got bored at work, I like consistency, and I had A LOT OF FUN experimenting with him ok?~~
  
1. This mod removes the mask from DLC1Miraak's outfit - meaning you'll see him without a mask when you're getting ~~thrown tf down~~ paralyzed in the first quest + any other time the reference uses this specific template.
  
2. This means - the final boss NPC record of Miraak **will still have his mask on**, and **you can still loot it after you kill him**. After looting him, you can bask in his ~~dead~~ presence now!
  
3. The 'Soul stealing' Miraak will still have his mask on, otherwise there will be a cursed transparent model of him if his mask is removed - that you **don't want to see**.
  
4. For the Miraak Follower patch - I removed his mask from his outfit as well.[/size][/font][font=Trebuchet MS][size=3]

The plugin(s) was created in **SSEEDIT** and **is ESL**.
  
**Note: I created this replacer in the 1.6.640 version (Plugin v.1.70), and it should work regardless of the new update.
  
  
[size=2]NB!** Please do double-check if everything was properly installed on your end. I usually test out all the versions and usually don't encounter any
  
problems, but modlists differ.

After 4 years of modding on my own, his videos have been very helpful
  
in navigating and understanding Creation Kit and FOMOD processes.
  
[SerketHetyt](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/serkethetyt/about-me?gameId=1704) - For the screenshots, the one-on-one tutorial for creating custom skin textures and just being a wonderful friend that I've met through here!
  
Ennui - A fellow lechon enjoyer who created the RSV patch and tested it!
  
The ppl I've met through here - I was always scared of this community in general ~~*(wonder why lmao)*~~, but want to give a special thanks to the people who have been nothing but friendly, welcoming and given me good vibes all around! The testers for the Update 2.0 *-* special thanks to Lulu, Ntz, Riverzend, WeelBones and Serket(again hehe) for the incredible screenies and testing the update for me!
  
  
**+ The people** who always shows any type of support of my hobbyist-work hehe - I always wanted to try share my creations, but am usually overcome by anxiety, so I really thank you all for the small kindness that lights up the dark world I perceive too much sometimes !
