Firstly I was inspired to give Sinding a new hairdo after seeing [Likeable Lucien](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66331). Then I decided to also tweak Sinding's facial traits but still not stray too far away from his vanilla features. Also, I originally created this makeover to "complete" a mod I had previously made which revoiced Sinding to sound like the Nords from Oblivion, but ended up hiding it after realizing how cringeworthy it was. Still I find that sharing this overhaul for him is good enough for me, and hope someone else will appreciate this.
  
  
The appearance tweaks:
  
-I tweaked Sinding's facial proportions, made his jaw ever so slightly wider and his brows slightly less outgoing, made his nose slightly shorter, and gave him a less visible underbite.
  
﻿-Tweaked his facetint as well and gave him less visible dirtmaps and a bit more bright-red lips, still made him maintain the slightly rough appearance in his face, as if he's in his middle/late 30's.
  
-Set his weight to a value of 55 so he will appear a bit more muscular, but still not a total beefcake. (You should read [this tutorial](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/articles/50317) if you're having neck gap issues)
  
-The facegen files were exported through the Creation Kit, all based on [Expressive Facegen Morphs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35785), as well as [High Res Warpaint and Dirtmaps for Men](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/4283).
  
  
-The mod now comes with ~~two~~ three different different hairstyles to choose between, one from KS Hairdos and one from HG Hairdos, and one based on Vanilla Hair Remake. The plugin no longer depends on these hair mods and neither High Poly Head, because I have now technically made the headparts "standalone" in xEdit and included the necessary .tri files in their own folder in the archive.
  
  
-The brow/beard/hair/eye/complexion textures are now standalone and part of the facegeometry. But how Sinding will look in your game may vary based on which body/face texture you have installed. (I can recommend [BnP - Male Skin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65402) for best results, that or Dizona body/vanilla textures which can be found at DDSWorkshop)
  
  
This makeover is meant to be used along with my [mod that turns Sinding into a follower](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33517) but this makeover also affects the ghost version of him that appears if you decide to kill him.
  
  
Installation:
  
First install the potential requirements.
  
Download one of the archives manually, open the archive in some zip program of your choice and then drag-and-drop﻿ the Data folder into your Skyrim SE directory (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition), althought it is recommended that you install the mod through NMM or Vortex.
  
Enable the plugin in a mod manager of your choice, such as Wrye Bash.
