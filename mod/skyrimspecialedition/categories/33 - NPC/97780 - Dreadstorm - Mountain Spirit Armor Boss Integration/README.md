# Dreadstorm - Mountain Spirit Armor Boss Integration
- Author: Ecskrillos
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97780


The idea came from the insatiable thirst for satisfaction of getting a cool armor mod dropped from a boss, RPG style.
  
  
Most cool armor mods are obtainable by crafting/chests/AIM. Why not make a boss-level NPC that drops said armor? lets go!
  
 
  
This mod basically adds a boss in the world that wears BDOR Mountain Spirit Armor. Beat him, and you get the armor. Simple as that.

[font=Verdana]**REQUIREMENT**[/font]

DAR/OAR

**[font=Verdana]INSTALLATION[/font]**
  
Vortex/MO2
  
Manual? Starfield is at the horizon and you still install mods manually? you do you I guess
  
Load order? let LOOT decide it. Should be load early
  
  
**[font=Verdana]LOCATION[/font]**
  
Tower Standing Stone
  
He is there, killing anything that moves
  
  
[font=Verdana]**THE BOSS**[/font]﻿![](https://imgur.com/pXQN6pM.png)﻿
  
The Boss is called **Dreadstorm**, he casts weather changing spell as he buffs himself, hence the name. (*The pic above didn't represent his location*)
  
  
Custom DW Axe Animation if using MCO, also SCAR so he can combo those animations.
  
I also put DAR animation for EldenRim Weapon Arts, but I don't use that myself, kindly report to me if he's using it.
  
  
Equipment: BDOR Mountain Spirit Armor Set + Dual Axe(with HP Absorb, the other STAMINA Absorb effect)
  
He drops all the sets plus the weapons, unenhanced. Also some stuff.
  
  
Abilities and Spells:[/left]Has a lot of melee-focused perks, he is basically a dual wield berserker with a ton of HP
  
Stone Flesh, Iron Flesh, Ebony Flesh Alteration Magic. He's always recast those when they run out.
  
\*Stone Flesh spell has been altered to also change the weather to snow storm.
  
  
[font=Verdana]**DIFFICULTY![](https://imgur.com/1z4u5ei.png)**
  
[/font]2 Difficulties, both of them are intended for high level players

TIPS[/font]**
  
coc doomstonesnowy01 to quicktest him. Beware, he doesn't like his personal space invaded.
  
He can be killed by pushing him off the ledge, but the easiest way to do it is unavailable. yes, he is immune to ragdoll by fus ro dah ;)

FAQ
  
[/font]**Q: Why DAR? Move on to OAR!
  
A: I'm sure there are plenty users still sticking to DAR, and OAR compatible with DAR folder, so it's a win win, nothing to argue.
  
  
Q: Where's the location? Why no map Image showing where he is at?
  
A: Google Tower Standing Stone
  
  
Q: Why he's spamming power attack?

Q: ESL?
  
A: Yep
  
  
Q: He's easy! even with Dovahkiin and Friends Must Die version!
