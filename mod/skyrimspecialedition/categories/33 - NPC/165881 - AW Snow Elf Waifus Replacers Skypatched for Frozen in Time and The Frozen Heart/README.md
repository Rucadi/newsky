Two high poly snow elf waifus replacers based on [my presets](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/150462) for the quest mods [Frozen in Time](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39732) and [The Frozen Heart](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/159911).
  
  
A handy fomod to pick and choose which replacer you want to apply.
  
You don't need to have both mods, just pick the replacer for the one you have installed.
  
  
With the power of Skypatcher, no edits were done to the original mods for full compatibility with any update/patch/etc.
  
(PS. I haven't played through the whole questlines yet so let me know if I missed something or you're having issues with their appearance).
  
  
**Required**:
  
- [MAW Assets 1.2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/110534) or later
  
- [Skypatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106659)
  
- [BEES](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441) if you are on an older version of Skyrim
  
- [Frozen in Time](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39732)﻿ or [The Frozen Heart](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/159911)﻿ or both
  
(or none if you only want to manually place my NPCs - see the "Side Note" below)
  
  
**The replacers will use your default skin and body.** 
  
(Again for compatibility reasons and an easier install, so you can use any body, physics, textures, etc.)
  
They are set at height 0.95 and weight 50.
  
If you find they have a neck gap you can either use [save unbaker](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85565) or set the NPC weight via console.
  
Spoiler
  
open console
  
click on the NPC and do all the following steps without deselecting the NPC
  
type: setnpcweight 50
  
enter
  
type: disable
  
enter
  
type: enable
  
enter
  
Should be fixed.
  
  
  
**ESL-flagged**.
  
  
**Side note:**
  
The replacers exist as separate NPCs in the .esp and are not placed in the world, but they are already set up to be basic followers with all the factions (marriage included) and a couple of ice magic spells. So if you want them as separate followers you can bring them into the game with [Modex](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/137877) or via console (search Taari or Shalina to get their ID and use the player.placeatme command). They will spawn and sandbox wherever you place them and be ready for recruitment.
  
  
BTW [Taari is already a follower with a custom intro dialogue here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73493).
