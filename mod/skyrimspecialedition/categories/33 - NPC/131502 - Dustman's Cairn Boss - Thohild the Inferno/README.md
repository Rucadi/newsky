***"Aesa raised this stone for her sister, Thohild the Inferno,
  
whose passion burned hot as the Red Forge."***

  
  
  
  
  
*This is one of the mods which adds draugr/priest bosses who implement the Word of Power they guard. This location doesn't actually have a boss in it, the enemy in central coffin is a random one. In the central coffin, there will always be Thohild the Inferno as the Draugr Death Overlord with fire-related arsenal.
  
  
  
  
Here is what Thohild the Inferno is capable of with this mod:****Fire Breath****: just a Fire Breath Shout which the player can obtain as well, similarly to Frost Breath which high-ranked Draugr possess.****Spells****: As of spells, she protects herself with Flame Cloak and summons Potent Flame Thrall as an ally. [i][size=4]She doesn't use any combat spells*, instead she summons two Flaming Wolves who explode as a Fireball.
  
  
[/size][/i]***Shouts****: As other high-tier Draugr, she also has Unrelenting Force and Disarm Shouts in her arsenal, as other Draugr Death Overlords do, although she tends to prefer Fire Breath unless the enemy has enormous fire resistance.****Weapon****: The weapon of this passionate woman is the fire-enchanted one-handed mace, meant to be used along with the anti-fire-enchanted shield or spells. The mace was chosen as the weapon to break heavy armor which the player will most likely wear during this quest line.****Strength****: Her health and magicka pools are notably increased in comparison to other draugr as well, [i][size=4]even if not as much as [Thjodrek](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/131393)'s, but still*.[/size][/i]
