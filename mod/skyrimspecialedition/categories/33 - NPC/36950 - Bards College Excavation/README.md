# Bards College Excavation

Once you complete "Tending the Flames" in vanilla Skyrim, there's not much reason to go back to Dead Men's Respite other than a rare radiant quest. With this mod, the Bards College will use your hard work to set up a full excavation site at the tomb, with 2 unique NPCs, fully voiced dialogue, and a repeatable quest to re-clear it for the bards.
  
  
This mod is an **esl-flagged esp**. All dialogue is **fully voiced** using edited vanilla lines. 
  
  
**This mod is compatible with the latest version of Skyrim (AE or SE).**
  
  
**Features:**
  
  
**Two unique bard NPCs**,  Rothen and Birinna, with different personalities and backgrounds. All of their dialogue is fully voiced. Here are some details on their behavior:
  

  
* Both have written journals about their experiences, find them in camp for in-depth background (and some creative curses in Rothen's journal).
During the weekdays, they'll spend time both in the exterior camp and in the interior trying to dig up artifacts from the rubble. They've got plenty of work to do!
  
* Both bards will spend 30 minutes each weekday practicing an instrument (with proper sound of course) in their camp, feel free to watch!
After you've met them at camp and introduced yourself, the bards will travel to Solitude on the weekend to shop and relax in the main square, then spend Saturday night at the Bards College.
  
* If you've completed Laid to Rest and thus brought safety to Morthal, the bards will eat dinner at the Moorside Inn on weekdays (but they won't upstage Lurbuk, even if he is a terrible bard).

  
You'll also find a larger tent reserved for Giraud Gemane as Dean of History (currently he won't actually visit, too busy with class) and one small spare tent for the player to use if desired. 
  
  
Once the dungeon respawns (30 days after clearing) you can also find a **repeatable misc. quest to clear the dungeon**:
  

  
* [size=3]Start the quest by talking to Rothen or Birinna and selecting a new dialogue option.
  
If you start talking to them but don't want to start the quest, feel free to tell them "no" and there won't be any objective cluttering up your journal. 
  
- Complete the quest by clearing the dungeon (aka killing the "boss" enemy), then talk to either of the bards for your reward.
The quest can be completed an unlimited number of times for the same reward, every time the dungeon respawns.

**Installation:**
  
  
The camp will appear next time you travel to Dead Men's Respite after Tending the Flames and becoming a bard yourself. 
  
  
This mod should work as intended when installed both before and after completing Tending the Flames. 
  

  
* If installed after, I recommend saving somewhere not at Dead Men's Respite interior/exterior
This will ensure that the cell gets reloaded and the camp/NPCs enable properly. 
  

  
**Compatibility:
  
  
To use with the Bards College Expansion creation from kinggath, a patch is required to recognize the new Bard's College cell.
  
Unfortunately, the patches are no longer hosted on Nexus, but can be found at the kinggathcreations forum.**
  
**Note**: If you see script file conflicts between any of my other mods, don't worry about it. They use identical copies of the same script, which causes Vortex/MO2 to see it as a conflict. You can let them overwrite each other in any order. 
  
  
Not compatible with:
  

  
* Open Cities (as NPCs are set up to sandbox in the vanilla Solitude Worldspace)
Any mods that significantly alter the exterior or first interior room of Dead Men's Respite
  

  
Compatible with:
  

  
* [size=3]Any other city overhaul mod
  
Legacy of the Dragonborn (I made sure my exterior additions don't overlap with LOTD's fragment dig site)
  
- Any other mods not specified (if you find a conflict, let me know)
  
Load Order:
  

  
* Load higher than lighting mods in order to prevent their lighting space changes from being overwritten
Otherwise sorting with Loot should be fine

Shout out to the awesome [Voice File Reference Tool 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18819)﻿ for making custom dialogue creation a lot easier! Also shout out to nexus user Monster23, who suggested a bards college excavation for my larger NPC Project, Reviving Skyrim.
