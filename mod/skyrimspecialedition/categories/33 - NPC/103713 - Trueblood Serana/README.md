What Does This Mod Do?
  
Trueblood Serana is the official visual overhaul sponsored by SDA, presenting a modern, lore-friendly reimagining of Skyrim's most captivating vampire. This mod, designed in tandem with the Serana Dialogue Add-On (SDA), transforms Serana's look while retaining her signature aura. Beyond the default makeover, dive deep into personalization. Choose from high-definition skin textures, three eye variants, and three distinct hairstyles, including the fan-favorite Seranaholic Classic. Whether you choose the glamorous Bijin Skin sheen from renowned artist rxkx22 or a more realistic BnP texture, your decisions ensure Serana mirrors your envisioned companion.
  
  
Every element is thoughtfully designed to blend within the Skyrim universe, ensuring an authentic, immersive experience. And as the SDA's dialogue evolution was spotlighted in Forbes, Trueblood Serana aims to set a new standard for your visual escapades with the Daughter of Coldharbour.
  
  
*P.S.:* "Lore-friendly" can be subjective. With years behind the leading dialogue mod for Serana, I offer a deeply informed take on her design. But every player's view is valid. Test out Trueblood Serana and see for yourself. I hope you sense the passion in each detail!

[/size][left]﻿[/left][left][size=3]How This Mod Came To Be:
  
The Serana Dialogue Add-On (SDA) began solely as a dialogue enhancement, without a signature visual. When promoting it, I relied on another modder's visuals, specifically Seranaholic. This reliance illuminated a gap: the need for a unified dialogue and visual experience, leading to the birth of Trueblood. Although independent, Trueblood is designed as a harmonious extension of SDA. The current design, a blend of homage to Serana's origins and a fresh twist, is a product of EDDante34's sculpting prowess and my overarching vision.
  
  
In time, all SDA promos will spotlight Trueblood, marking a pivotal evolution from my longstanding use of Seranaholic. Remember, the choice remains yours: pair SDA with Trueblood or opt for another replacer. Whatever your choice, I hope you appreciate the effort and artistry that went into both projects.

Mod Requirements
  
Skyrim | Just the base game! If you don't have it yet, you can get it here: <https://www.g2a.com/n/martimius>
  
  
  
Compatibility
  
Trueblood Serana cannot be used concurrently with other Serana replacers such as Seranaholic or ReImagined. It's a tough choice, picking among these three gems! Additionally, if any mod (that isn't a replacer) modifies Serana's NPC record, you'll need to create a compatibility patch or seek assistance in crafting one.
  
  
However, Trueblood Serana pairs perfectly with SDA. In fact, it's highly recommended to use them together for a comprehensive experience!
  
  
Install Instructions
  
1. Install how you normally would with your mod manager of choice. Make sure the esp is **enabled**before you start the game. 
  
2. Generate Bodyslides for your installed body preset of choice (CBBE, 3BA, BHUNP Supported). // **Only for Version A. You don't need to use this with Version B.**
  
3. (Optional) When installing with the SDA Spell Toggle Expanded Patch from the [SDA Patch Hub](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70782), tick the "Trueblood Serana" option.
  
  
  
  
Update Instructions
  
Just replace the old version with the new one. 
  
  
  
Uninstalling
  
Uninstalling mods like Trueblood is unsafe mid-save, since it adds scripts that are baked into your save and makes alterations to existing game records and NPCs (Serana most notably). Make sure you test this mod out first before you keep in your load order for real.
  
  
  
Load Order
  
Any should be fine, as long as this mod wins any and all NPC record conflicts. If you're using patches, make sure they load after Trueblood and nothing overwrites those as well.
