**DESCRIPTION**
  
  
Enjoy **[Citizens of Tamriel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29069)**? Tired of jumping into Riverwood only to hear Malik's booming voice from across the map as if he is speaking directly into your ear?
  
  
Well, the first module fixes this.
  
  
I sanity checked the average loudness of Malik's voice and a few other characters, everything seemed fine. However, just due to the nature of the recording (compression) and other factors, there might be some in-engine volume normalization happening that is just boosting his voice and resulting in him sounding far more perceivably louder than he actually is. And, to be fair, if you stand at the west entrance of Riverwood he's not actually far from you. This is just a quick edit - I ran all of the voice lines through RX8, normalized to around -3-to-4 db, and lowered the voice around the 200-400hz shelf by 1.5db. This is actually a trick I do when mixing vocals to make the recording seem a bit more "distant". It's definitely a hack, but it works most of the time.

*Dude had, like, over 350 voice lines. Not lazy. I'm smart, actually.*

  
  
This is a destructive edit, and if you really had the time and patience (why) you could probably overwrite the output model for all of his dialogue lines and turn him down. However, this sounds fine in my short time testing. I batch edited every voice file for consistency - when I only replaced a few the edit was a bit jarring. I also a/b'd his voice lines with the rest of the characters in my game and volume wise they sounded fine.
  
  
Second module is just an Anya appearance edit I made the other day. No idea where to share it, I imagine some people might want it. I don't really have much motivation to do the rest of the cast. They personally look fine in my game. If I run into any others I might upload them separately - so track the mod!
