# Kyne's Temple Consequences

Once you complete "The Blessings of Nature" in vanilla Skyrim, the only visible result of your choice to restore or replace the Gildergreen is the tree/sapling itself. With this mod, your choice has a greater impact on Kynareth's favor toward the Whiterun Temple, and it will determine their fortune in treating patients and recruiting pilgrims. 
  
  
This mod is an **esl-flagged esp**. All dialogue is **fully voiced** using edited vanilla lines. 
  
  
**This mod is compatible with the latest version of Skyrim (AE or SE).**
  
  
**Features:**
  
  
**Four unique NPCs**, all with fully voiced dialogue. Which of them will spawn and what they will do will depend on your choice in the quest. They include two potential acolytes, Erissa and Rellis, the sickly farmer from vanilla, who I've named Ionath, and a new injured guard Mektir. 
  
  
Some new dialogue for Acolyte Jenssen, who has none in vanilla. After completing the quest, you can talk to him to hear how the temple is faring. 
  
  
Danica doesn't have any additional dialogue at the moment, but you can find her true thoughts on the situation in a letter on her desk. 
  
  
Other changes will also occur in the Temple of Kynareth and Eldergleam Sanctuary. For a complete list, see the spoilers below.
  
  
**SPOILERS!!**If you choose to plant a new Gildergreen sapling, you will see the following impact:
  
Spoiler 
  

  
* Acolyte Erissa will come to work at the temple and have a cot in the nook near Jensen's bed.
Acolyte Rellis will come to work at the temple and also have a cot nearby. You can find a letter to him next to his bed.
  
* Both acolytes will work at the temple during the day and take lunch at the Gildergreen. They will each travel to Eldergleam Sanctuary for a few days each week, Rellis Mon-Thurs and Erissa Sat-Mon.
The sickly farmer, now called Ionath, will recover and work some at the temple. She will often spend her afternoons shopping in the market. She also gets a cot in the temple as she has nowhere else to go. She will sometimes visit the Bannered Mare.
  
* The sickly guard, Mektir, will recover and can be found patrolling outside Dragonsreach during the day, or eating in the dungeon at night. He will visit Whiterun's taverns some days as well.
Jenssen will have new dialogue. 
  
* The temple potions supply (back corner on the shrine side) will be fully stocked thanks to pilgrims and good fortune.
More insects and butterflies can be found in the temple (Kynareth is the nature goddess)
  
* Danica will have a positive report on her desk.
Eldergleam Sanctuary will have various bedrolls and supplies for the two visiting pilgrims and Maurice.
  
  
If you choose to use sap on the old Gildergreen, you will see the following impact:
  
Spoiler 
  

  
* Acolyte Erissa will come to work at the temple and have a cot in the nook near Jensen's bed.
Erissa will work at the temple during the day and take lunch at the Gildergreen. She will not travel to Eldergleam Sanctuary (since everyone's likely dead there anyways).
  
* The sickly farmer, now called Ionath, will recover and work some at the temple. She will often spend her afternoons shopping in the market. She also gets a cot in the temple as she has nowhere else to go. She will sometimes visit the Bannered Mare.
The sickly guard, Mektir, will disappear, leaving a shield behind. You can guess what that means for his fate. 
  
* Jenssen will have new dialogue.
The temple potions supply (back corner on the shrine side) will be partially stocked thanks to pilgrims.
  
* Danica will have a mixed report on her desk.
  
  
Additionally for improved immersion, the pilgrims in Eldergleam Sanctuary will now have bedrolls from the beginning for a place to sleep. 
  
  
No vanilla NPCs have edited AI packages for the moment, to ensure greater compatibility.  
  
  
**Installation:**
  
  
The changes to the temple and NPCs will appear next time Whiterun and the temple cell are reloaded after completing the quest. This can be triggered most quickly by fast traveling somewhere distant, then fast traveling back.
  
  
This mod should work as intended when installed both before and after completing The Blessings of Nature. 
  

  
* If installed after, I recommend first saving somewhere not at Whiterun or the Temple of Kynareth.
This will ensure that the cells get reloaded and the objects/NPCs enable properly. 
  

  
**Compatibility:**
  
**Note**: If you see script file conflicts between any of my mods, don't worry about it. They use identical copies of the same script, which causes Vortex/MO2 to see it as a conflict. You can let them overwrite each other in any order. 
  
  
Not compatible with:
  

  
* Open Cities (as NPCs are set up to spawn in the vanilla Whiterun Worldspace)
Any mods that completely overhaul the interior of Whiterun's Temple of Kynareth - **patch for JKs Temple of Kynareth now available under optional files.**
  
* Any mods that completely overhaul Eldergleam Sanctuary

  
Use patch for compatibility with:
  

  
* [JK's Temple of Kynareth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56737)﻿ - my esl-flagged esp patch (available on this page under optional files) incorporates the features of both mods. I've moved my objects such as new NPC beds to ensure no clipping, while also making the potions added by JK depend on the quest outcome as with my mod. Personally, I think they work great together and I'll be using both!

  
Compatible with:
  

  
* [size=3]Any other city overhaul mods
  
Any AI Overhaul mods
  
- Guards Armor Replacer
Gildergreen Regrown (I didn't touch the tree itself since Arthmoor's mod works well for that)
  
- Wintersun (I didn't touch the Kynareth shrine, so should work fine)
Maxi's Temple of Kynareth
  
- Any other mods not specified (if you find a conflict, let me know)
  
Load Order:
  

  
* Load higher than lighting mods in order to prevent their lighting space changes from being overwritten
Otherwise sorting with Loot should be fine
