*About Load Order*

[font=Verdana]
  
Campfire is a "master" (.ESM file), which means that it will load above most other mods (.ESP files), and you cannot change its position in the load order (such as below USSEP). Don't worry; this is normal!
  
  

*Description*

  
  
**Campfire**is **the most feature-rich stand-alone camping mod** for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. It was created from **Frostfall 2.6**'s unique, immersive camping system. Now, you can enjoy an unparalleled camping experience in conjunction with some of your other favorite survival and immersion mods.

**Build a campfire**, from a small, fragile spark to a roaring blaze, and use it to cook with a cooking pot (or just grill right over the flames), or sit with your followers around the fire. Large campfires uplift and inspire, granting bonuses to skill gain.
  
  
**Create and buy camping equipment** using items in the world around you. Build tents, tanning racks, a portable enchanting kit, and more. Carry all of your extra gear in Campfire-added **backpacks** that dynamically display your bed roll, torch, cooking pot, axe, and water skin. Your followers (up to 3, plus one animal) will sit or sleep with you inside of your tent, or sit around a campfire with you. If your follower is a spouse, they will even cuddle up to you when sleeping in your tent (vanilla marriage system only).
  
  
**Search for resources** (using **Harvest Wood ability**) to search the nearby area for deadwood and branches. Use these to build hatchets, arrows, and other useful creations. The new **Instincts** vision ability allows you to see creatures that make noise, smell the bodies of the dead (including the undead), and optionally show the direction toward your current quest target.
  
  
**Advance your skills** using Campfire's unique Skill System, modeled after the base game perk system. Campfire contains the **Camping Skill**, which allows you to build longer-lasting campfires, find more resources, see more with the Instincts ability, and more.
  
  
Campfire is also lightweight, and has no persistently running background scripts; everything is on-demand like you would expect from a stand-alone camping mod, so the performance impact of Campfire is negligible.

[font=Verdana]Campfire is also the foundation of other mods, like [Frostfall 3](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/671), and the upcoming Last Seed. It is a stable, common platform on which to build my suite of survival mods to ensure a deep level of integration between them while still allowing them to stand on their own.

[font=Verdana]Want to create your own tents and supplies for use in Campfire? Campfire is also a **modder’s framework** and allows you to create your own camping equipment easily, **without any code required.** Just follow the tutorials, fill out some properties, and you’ll have new camping equipment created in no time. What’s more, you can distribute your creations as your own mod. [Visit the Mod Developer's page here!](http://skyrimsurvival.com/home/campfire/mod-developers/)If you are an advanced modder, you can also create your own Skill Trees just like the ones found in Campfire and Frostfall 3 in order to give your players a rich, interactive progression system. See [this tutorial series](http://skyrimsurvival.com/home/campfire/mod-developers/creating-campfire-mods/tutorial-5-basketweaving-new-skill-tree/) for more information.
