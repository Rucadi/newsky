# Dapper Deliveries - A Courier Overhaul
- Author: Tragedian
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64057


**OVERVIEW**
  
  
So what does this mod do, exactly? Great question! Well, it's a visual upgrade for Skyrim's most dedicated errand boy, the Courier, but with some additional tweaks that are practically guaranteed to boost your immersion. That's right! *Immersion*... Sweet, sweet *IMMERSION*...
  
  
  

  
* The Courier will be a bit better-dressed. No more ragged farm clothes. He's a professional!

  

  
* Actual deliveries! Ever wonder why someone would travel across the continent to deliver a single letter? It makes very little sense. Now, the Courier will be seen carrying other supplies & items for delivery to signify you're not his only customer. He's got other stops to make!

  

  
* He's packing cold, hard steel! Skyrim is ravaged by war & teeming with dangerous wildlife. You'd think the Courier would at least carry some protection against the occasional over-aggressive mudcrab. Sure, it's just for show, but they don't know that!

  

  
* Freckles!

  

  
* Two versions. A stand-alone version & one for users of Provincial Courier Service by Arthmoor.

  

  
* [size=3]ESL-flagged so it won't count towards your ESP limit!
  
  
  
**REQUIREMENTS & RECOMMENDATIONS**
  
  
This mod has no hard requirements other than the base game. However, facegen was generated using [Expressive Facegen Morphs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35785) so [Expressive Facial Animations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19532)﻿ could be considered a soft requirement to ensure there's no incidental clipping. The Courier will use whichever body mods & textures you have installed. Personally, I use [Tempered Skins](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7902) & [True Faces](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34636), as seen in the screenshots. If you'd like the Courier's backpacks to look more stylish, ElSopa's textures from [Big Backpack HD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36445)﻿ are absolutely stunning & highly recommended. Just download the LOTD version & allow its textures to overwrite mine.
  
  
  
**COMPATIBILTY & OTHER INFO**
  
  
Any mod that directly edits the Courier will result in a conflict & is therefore incompatible. However, several of the most popular mail service mods are entirely compatible!
  
  
[Courier Delivers to NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42928) - Compatible
  
[Courier Stays In Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40931/) - Compatible
  
[Provincial Courier Service](https://www.afkmods.com/index.php?/files/file/2006-provincial-courier-service/)﻿ - Compatible (Select the compatible version in the FOMOD)
  
[Skald's Mail](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31791) - Compatible (Select "Courier for important deliveries" in the MCM)
  
[The Courier Crew](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61400) - Compatible (Ensure my mod's files are loaded below theirs)
  
  
[Better Courier](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40709) - Semi-Compatible (No direct conflicts, but edits the delivery system in a way that you'll hardly ever see my edits in-game.)
  
  
The Courier's deliveries (i.e. backpacks/scrolls) can't be stolen or equipped by the player because I've not flagged them as playable. This is intentional. Please refer to the credits if you'd like them for yourself.
