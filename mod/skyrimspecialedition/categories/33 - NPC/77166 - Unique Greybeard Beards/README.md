Have you ever been miffed that the Greybeards, an order literally named after their facial hair, have generic, mostly pretty reasonably-sized beards shared by tons of other NPCs? Yes? Me too. Now, the Greybeards have their own unique beards, with all the volume and splendor that you first imagined on the way up the "7,000" steps back in November of 2011. Best of all: each beard has been selected to match that Greybeard's vanilla beard type, so each monk's visual aesthetic has been preserved and they're all still recognizable! Well, if you're like me and can recognize the Greybeards, that is. I'm probably the only person who knows who Einarth is.
  
  

  
* **Arngeir** gets the biggest beard of all: a long braided number.
**Wulfgar** gets a long, majestic beard with no frills.
  
* **Einarth** gets his thin beard lengthened to epic proportions.
**Borri** gets a fluffy beard that makes up for its length in volume.

This mod will only conflict with mods that modify the NPC records and/or facegen of the four Greybeards. You can easily resolve these conflicts using [SSEEdit](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/164) by following [these steps](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/articles/53030). The actor records and facegen packaged in this mod are identical to vanilla other than the beards. The beards are not playable; you will have to install [Beards of Power](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42635) if you want to use them for your own character. This mod is flagged ESL and does not contain any textures.
