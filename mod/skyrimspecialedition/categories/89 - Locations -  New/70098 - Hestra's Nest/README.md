*Beyond the Druadach Mountains, there exists a hidden valley of merry misfits...*

When the sun rises and dawn breaks, the inhabitants of this idyllic land emerge; wanderers lost in the mountains, adventurers ailed by knee-related injuries, warriors seeking to guard a once prosperous trading route, Forsworn looking to further their cause, and exiled on.
  
  
Hestra's Nest is a short term modding project developed by the students of the Arcane University. It's an opportunity for students to collaborate across departments and experience mod development in a structured learning environment, while receiving in-depth feedback and creating work to a higher standard.
  
  
To start your journey into Hestra's Nest, you will need to start an introductory quest. The quest starts after you encounter two unique npcs, as they leave Markarth, and listen to their conversation.
