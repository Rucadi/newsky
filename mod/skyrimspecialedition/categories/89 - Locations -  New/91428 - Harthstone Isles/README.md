*Some ways off the icy fields of Winterhold, in the Sea of Ghosts, lie the*

*Harthstone Isles...
  
  
This small archipelago might've remained undiscovered for all time, if the East Empire Company hadn't stumbled over it when a drunk captain took a wrong turn starboard on their way to Roscrea. Whilst humble in size, this spa-to-be is home to a small community of unique individuals (for better or worse) and is a shining beacon of Imperial expansion that doesn't butt heads with Solitude.*

Harthstone Isles is a short term modding project developed by the students of the Arcane University, as an opportunity for students to collaborate across departments and experience mod development in a structured learning environment, while receiving in-depth feedback and creating work to a higher standard.
  
  
To start your journey to the Harthstone Isles, you will need to come upon two familiar figures in the hotsprings of The Volcanic Tundra, near Kynesgrove - or alternatively make your way directly to the Windhelm docks.
