**Assist the Ashen Veil, an Order of Morrowind's Tribunal Temple, in reclaiming their fortress-monastery of Bal Meryan from the occupying forces of Stendarr's Hammer, an extremist group of Vigilants of Stendarr. Track down the scattered survivors of the Ashen Veil, recruit them as your custom voiced followers, and support them through an extensive questline. Or kill them, your choice.**
  
  
**Bal Meryan** is a Fortress-Monastery just across the Velothi Mountains in Morrowind that has been home to the Order of the Ashen Veil for almost two centuries. "Bal Meryan" roughly translates to "Stone-Home" in Old Velothi, which suits its status as a stone-built monastery carved into the sides of a narrow mountain pass. It is currently under the control of Stendarr's Hammer, an extremist faction of the Vigil of Stendarr. As part of the main quest of this mod, decide the fate of Bal Meryan - is it to remain in the hands of Stendarr's Hammer, or will you return it to the stewardship of the Tribunal Temple and their monastic order?
  
  
The **Order of the Ashen Veil** is a monastic order affiliated with the Tribunal Temple of Morrowind, dedicated to the worship of the Daedric Princes Azura, Boethiah, and Mephala. They have recently fallen on hard times, and only half a dozen scattered survivors remain of the order. Their escape into Morrowind was cut off by Stendarr's Hammer, forcing them to double back across the border into Skyrim. Even now the desperate women are pursued across the land by their tormentors. This will feel like a full faction, similar to the Dark Brotherhood, Dawnguard, or Companions.
  
  
Enjoy my **extensive questline** and **follower quests**, which seek to bring back the old-school feel of Morrowind to my little corner of Skyrim. Fair warning, there are no quest markers. You will need to pay attention to dialogue and explore a bit to complete these quests. Some of them also have several ways to complete them, with good and bad endings. Pay attention to what the ladies say as you travel with them - their comments are not meant to be ignored. If you take your time and don't rush through fast traveling / coc-ing from location to location, it could take between **10-15 hours to complete** all the quests. The quests are not intended to be combat grinds, or dungeon crawls, but rather traveling excursions that help you get to know the ladies of the Ashen Veil and their faction, and hopefully have some fun as you do so.

**Features:**
  
  

  
* Six followers, survivors of the **Order of the Ashen Veil**. All are Dunmer women in keeping with the traditions of their order. They each have a new custom voice generated on Elevenlabs. They will be wearing **Chitin Armor** and **Tribunal Temple** robes when you find them. The pictured outfits are just what I put them in for my own game.

  

  
* **Bal Meryan**, the fortress-monastery of the Ashen Veil. A player stronghold in its own small worldspace across the Velothi Mountains in Morrowind that you can reclaim, live in, and recruit staff for. Size is roughly twice that of Fort Dawnguard. Bal Meryan also has a large number of linked custom storage activators to make your loot-stashing life just that much easier. There is a **teleport spell** to return here, which can be found on a shelf in the Temple near the main shrines.

  

  
* **Extensive main questline**. Gather the survivors of the Ashen Veil, lead them on a daring assault to reclaim their stronghold. Help them replenish the ranks of their Order and build connections with other factions in Skyrim. Recruit vendors to move into Bal Meryan and provide services.

  

  
* **Extensive follower side quests**. After you finish the main questline, each follower has a personal questline that you can complete along with them as they travel with you. Do not feel the need to have all six with you at once. Instead, take one or two of your choice, do some tasks (and their quest), then return to the stronghold to switch them out.

  

  
* Basic multi-follower support using very simple custom frameworks for the Ashen Veil. However, my system is very basic, and I strongly encourage you to use something like [Nether's Follower Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55653)﻿ instead. You will need to import them into your follower framework, but they are all safe to import. They should work fine with **any follower framework**, any **wig mod**, any **mod that manages outfits** like SPID or [Dress Up Lovers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28736)﻿, and any **mod that moves them into houses** such as [Settling of Squad](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/125471) ﻿or [My Home is Your Home](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20227)﻿.

  

  
* Recruit guards and staff for Bal Meryan. Any **Dunmer female follower** with the FemaleDarkElf, FemaleCommander, FemaleCondescending, FemaleEvenToned, FemaleYoungEager, or FemaleSultry voice is eligible, be they mod added or from the base game. Jenassa can be brought immediately, for example, but you will need to complete Azura's quest in her favor to recruit Aranea Ienith (as that will make her into a follower).

  

  
* **Alternate Questline**. Destroy the Ashen Veil once and for all, hunt down the six survivors, and claim your bounty with the victorious Stendarr's Hammer at Bal Meryan. They will award you the title of Castellan and the right to live at the fort with access to their vendors and trainers. Intended for playthroughs where you don't want to cavort with Daedra worshippers.

  

  
* **Mature themes**. Some of the women curse. They might joke about Daedric sacrifices, or express (in-world) racism, or have a fade-to-black scene with an NPC. I would not consider this an "adult mod" in any way, but am noting the maturity of some of the themes as a heads up for folks.
**ESM Flagged**. This mod is ESM Flagged and will not count against your reference limit. It is NOT ESL Flagged, nor can it be made such, as it has far far too many records.
  

  

  
* Patch provided in **Optional Files** to connect the passage to Morrowind to the grazelands near Fort Dulan (in the [Journey to Baan Malar](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/114518)﻿ worldspace). Load this patch after my other patches if you want its renaming of my little worldspace from "Morrowind" to "Bal Meryan Stronghold" to work.

**Requirements:**
  

  
* [size=3]The only requirement for this mod is **any CBBE/3BA or UNP/BHUNP compatible body**, as I did custom tattoo work. Huge thank you to **Yandros** for helping convert the 3BA work I did into BHUNP textures. Choose the appropriate version for the body you use in the downloads. If you do not want to have NSFW/naked bodies anywhere in your game, simply chose the "underwear only" option in the CBBE installer, or the "underwear only" option in the UNP installer, or my personal recommendation, Sonderbain's excellent [Underwear Only 3BA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/131021)﻿ mod.
  

  
* It is possible that folks using older versions of Skyrim might need **[Backported Extended ESL Support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441)﻿**, though this isn't an ESL and doesn't use the extended range. I note this because on other non-ESL mods, I have seen folks fix issues they have by installing this.

**Stendarr's Hammer**
  
  
An extremely aggressive order of the Vigil of Stendarr led by Curate-Militant Bjorkild. They grew tired of hunting down scattered groups of daedra worshippers and decided to launch a daring assault on a faction of the Tribunal Temple itself. It remains to be seen if their actions were foolhardy or valiant.

**Frequently Asked Questions:**
  
  

  
* **How do I start the mod?** To start the mod, find any one of the six survivors of the Ashen Veil. They may be found at the following locations:

Spoiler
  
Ardela Vos: Labyrinthian Exterior, fighting trolls.
  
﻿Drelyra Uvirith: Road between Stonehills and Dawnstar, fighting Vigilants.
  
Nindasu Lerylas: Raven Rock Temple.
  
Ruveni Berandu: Ragged Flagon in Riften.
  
Selvoneth Uvirith: Way off at Saering's Watch in Solstheim.
  
Vendressa Melandi: In Fort Kastav's Jail.
  
  
  

  
* **One of my followers attacked me, why'd she do that?**

Spoiler
  
For two of the followers, if you do not pay attention to their dialogue or warnings, they might betray you depending on choices made during their follower questlines.
  
  
  

  
* **Why aren't there any quest markers?** This is intentional. The necessary information is presented in your journal (quest stage notes) or written notes.
**Where is the entrance to the new worldspace?** See the last two images in the gallery. The map marker will be revealed at the appropriate stage in the quest, or you can go there early if you'd like to spend time with the Hammer of Stendarr.
  
  
* **Can you make a walkthrough for the quests?** No. It is intentional that some of the quests require a bit of thought and exploration. Creating a step by step walkthrough would defeat the theme of what I am going for. If you get stuck on anything, feel free to post a message in the comments or on my Discord channel and I can give you some guidance.
**I attacked one of the survivors of the Ashen Veil and now I can't recruit any of them!** This means you chose the alternate path where you hunt down and kill the six survivors for their bounty, and following finishing them all off, you can return to Bal Meryan, claim your bounty, and live with the Vigilants. If you do not want to pursue this path, you will need to reload an earlier save, and choose NOT to attack them in dialogue.
  
  
* **Is this mod ESM flagged?** Yes. It will not count against the reference limit.
**Is this mod ESL flagged?** No, and it is far far too large to ever be ESL Flagged.
  
  
* **Are the patches ESL flagged?** Yes.
**Do I really need CBBE or UNP?** Yes. You need some sort of CBBE/3BA or UNP/BHUNP body, or any of their variations. If you do not have any of these, npcs will have texture mismatches.
  
  
* **Can you do a Vanilla Hair version?** No. I have open permissions however, so you can.
**Can you do a Vanilla Body version?** No. But you can! This will be much easier than doing a Vanilla Hair version, as all you'll need to do is drag and drop appropriate body textures (including normals, speculars, etc) into the textures/Socalista/Reclamations/Body/ folder and appropriate face textures into the textures/Socalista/Reclamations/Heads/ folder, and rename them to match the ones in there. They will however, lose all their tattoos, which is why I have not made such a version myself.
  
  
* **What resource did you use for their voices?** I generated all of their voices using Elevenlabs and custom created voice templates I made myself. I would gladly share the resource, but Elevenlabs does not have a feature that lets me do so. If you want to use their voices for any addons, you have full permission to - just turn their .fuz files back to .wav files and use their lines to build a voice library in an application of your choice.
**Can I marry the NPCs?** No. They are dedicated to the Order of the Ashen Veil, and their vows do not allow marriage (of course, anyone may make an addon that changes this and adds marriage support).
  
  
* **Can I adopt children and bring them to the monastery?** No. The rules of the monastery do not allow children (though, anyone may of course make an addon that changes this and adds that support).
**Can I Flower Girls / OStim / Sexlab up the NPCs?** Sure. I don't have anything blocking any of those mods, use whichever it is you normally use, though their custom voices will be missing lines.
  
  
* **Why are they all Dunmer women?** The Order of the Ashen Veil has a women-only membership of nuns, as part of the Tribunal Temple of Morrowind. I also like making women presets, and I like Dunmer.
**Why don't they have Dunmer Klingon ridge brows?** Personal preference in my design choice. If you want to add ridge brows, download and install the addon provided in Optional Files.
  
  
* **I'd like to give them human-looking eyes to match the other elves in my game**. Go ahead. It is as simple as replacing the textures in the textures/Socalista/Reclamation/Eyes/ folder with new eyes of your choice, renamed appropriately.
**Why can't I hire non-Dunmer or men for the 10 staff positions?** The rules of the monastery forbid this (but again, anyone may make an addon that changes this).
  
  
* **Why can't I hire random regular NPCs who aren't followers for the 10 staff positions?** I have no way of knowing which mods you use, and if recruiting an NPC from those mods, or from the base game that interacts with those mods, might cause them to break. However, FOLLOWER NPCs are extremely safe to use for such things, so I made that as a requirement.
**Will this need a patch for X? Is this compatible with X?** As I only made one tiny navmesh change in one cell, chances are minimal that a patch will be needed or there will be an incompatibility. There are a couple spots in Solstheim where I made some additions - if you have a mod that alters Kagrumez exterior or Fort Frostmoth exterior that needs patching, let me know.
  
  
* **Why is the esp called "Socalista Reclamations"?** The Reclamations are Azura, Boethiah, and Mephala, the Daedric Princes of the Tribunal Temple. I had this as my working name, and by the time I finalized "Bal Meryan" and "Ashen Veil", I had already done substantial work and created a pretty extensive Lux patch, so I kept the old name.
**What level should I be to start this mod?** This mod can be started at any level but some of the fights will be very tough if you are below level 10-15.
  
  
* **I've lost X follower, where is she?** Each of the six followers has a summon tome in her inventory you can access. You can add this tome to your inventory through the console if she is lost, "Spell Tome: Summon Drelyra" "Spell Tome: Summon Ardela" etc, learn the spell from the tome, cast the tome.
**The NPCs are bald, what happened?** If the NPCs in your game are bald, that likely means you are using Racial Skin Variance (RSV) or the Nolvus mod list, both of which are known for this issue. There is a patch provided for [Racial Skin Variance (RSV) - SPID](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81668)﻿ in the Optional Files, though Nolvus uses an older and unsupported version of this mod that requires an esp patch - consult the Nolvus author for support.
