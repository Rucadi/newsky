**Do not install the Lawbringer module while in the Hjorkvild Isles.**

  
[Lawbringer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29882) ﻿is a great mod that allows you to claim locations around Skyrim for a faction of your choice, ensuring that they will only respawn in the future with friendly NPCs. It is really enjoyable to claim locations and see a tangible impact on the world around you. Places like Valtheim Keep and Pine Watch Bridge are fun locations because they are bandit camps stationed on the roadway, so claiming them feels very impactful.
  
  
This mod is the fourth in my series of Lawbringer addons, and it will add support for four factions to claim a single location from [Siege at Icemoth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/109541): the titular Fort Icemoth!
  
  
This mod's FOMOD installer also contains several small tweaks for Siege at Icemoth. The main Lawbringer module is not required to use these tweaks.

Haafingar Hold is one of the nine holds of Skyrim and contains the province's capital, Solitude. The region is known for its wealth and distinctly Imperial way of life compared to the rest of Skyrim. The Hjorkvild Isles are considered part of Haafingar Hold, but they currently have no presence there to reinforce the claim. Fort Icemoth would be a prime location to establish a garrison and reestablish themselves in the Sea of Ghosts.

The Kingdom of Jehanna, one of High Rock's eight major kingdoms, has a long history of conflict with Skyrim; its ownership has oscillated between the two regions several times. To this day, some Nords in Jehanna still believe the kingdom should instead be a Skyrim hold. The Hjorkvild Isles have famously been a disputed territory between Jehanna and Haafingar. While ostensibly under the rule of the Jarl of Solitude, they currently have little actual power over the area. If Fort Icemoth can be cleared, it would make a good place for the Kingdom of Jehanna to reassert their claim on the isles to the north.

The Imperial Legion is the military branch of the Mede Empire. They exert influence across Cyrodiil, High Rock, and Skyrim, with the latter having a stronger presence than normal due to the ongoing civil war. Fort Icemoth was previously an Imperial fort, but they were forced to abandon it due to deteriorating supply lines caused by the Great War. Once the fort is resecured, it may be a good time for the Legion to reestablish themselves at Fort Icemoth to strengthen their northern trade routes.
  
  
[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TateTaylorUSA/TateTaylorUSA/main/assets/images/lco-wyrmstooth/EECIcon.png) The East Empire Company ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TateTaylorUSA/TateTaylorUSA/main/assets/images/lco-wyrmstooth/EECIcon.png)](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:East_Empire_Company)
  
  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TateTaylorUSA/TateTaylorUSA/main/assets/images/lco-wyrmstooth/EEco.png)
  
  
The East Empire Company is a trading business funded by the Empire but operates independently from the government proper. They maintain a small but powerful standing army of mercenaries to protect their interests around Tamriel. The Company previously used Fort Icemoth as a common layover point in the Sea of Ghosts and had a warehouse on the premises. Taking control of the old fort may be beneficial for stationing a stronger defensive presence against corsairs in the north. Regardless of whether the East Empire Company takes direct control of Fort Icemoth or not, they are still interested in again utilizing the island for their business ventures.

[![](https://images.uesp.net/archive/9/93/20111122181406%21SR-mapicon-Solitude.png)](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Haafingar)[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TateTaylorOH/TateTaylorOH/main/assets/images/LCO-Icemoth/JehannaIcon.png)](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Jehanna)[![](https://images.uesp.net/d/da/SR-mapicon-Imperial_Camp.png)](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Imperial_Legion)[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TateTaylorUSA/TateTaylorUSA/main/assets/images/lco-wyrmstooth/EECIcon.png)](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:East_Empire_Company)﻿﻿﻿
  
  
Fort Icemoth is an abandoned Imperial fort in the Hjorkvild Isles, northwest of Skyrim and just north of Jehanna. Its location makes it appealing for various factions seeking to establish a garrison in the Sea of Ghosts to safeguard trade routes passing through the region. An old East Empire Company Warehouse stands adjacent to the fort. It is in every faction's best interest to extend an invitation to the East Empire Company to revive their trade post and improve the flow of trade through the region.

  
**Miscellaneous Tweaks**
  
  
This mod's FOMOD installer also contains several small tweaks for Siege at Icemoth. The main Lawbringer module is not required to use these tweaks:
  
  
Breton Imperial Fort Icemoth
  
  

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TateTaylorOH/TateTaylorOH/main/assets/images/LCO-Icemoth/BretonImperialFortIcemoth.png) ﻿![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TateTaylorOH/TateTaylorOH/main/assets/images/LCO-Icemoth/BretonImperialFortIcemoth02.png)

  
Gives Fort Icemoth more prominent Breton-style parapets. The Hjorkvild Isles are located on the border between Skyrim and High Rock, so this just shows how some small Breton influences may change how an Imperial Fort appears.
  
  
Pre-generated LOD files are included, so you won't need to rerun DynDOLOD. However, if you're using a texture replacer, you might still want to rerun it for better texture matching.
  
  
CoMAP Configuration
  
  

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TateTaylorOH/TateTaylorOH/main/assets/images/LCO-Icemoth/CoMAP.png) ﻿![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TateTaylorOH/TateTaylorOH/main/assets/images/LCO-Icemoth/CoMAP2.png)

  
Uses [CoMAP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56123) to change the map markers for Shipwrecks and Glacial Caves to be consistent with the mod's styling.
  
  
I4 Configuration
  
  

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TateTaylorOH/TateTaylorOH/main/assets/images/LCO-Icemoth/I4Before.png) ﻿![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TateTaylorOH/TateTaylorOH/main/assets/images/LCO-Icemoth/I4.png)

  
Uses [I4](https://www.bing.com/search?q=i4+skyrim&cvid=bf830a9608f742bebb08e6d6c4e21795&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIGCAEQRRg7MgYIAhBFGDsyBggDEEUYOzIGCAQQRRhAMgcIBRBFGPxV0gEHNzA5ajBqNKgCALACAA&FORM=ANAB01&PC=U531) to change the inventory icon for the Topaz Dragon Claw to match vanilla Dragon Claws.
  
  
**Recommended Mods**
  
  
In the base game, the East Empire Company does not have a unique aesthetic; the mercenaries you see in "Rise in the East" wear Imperial Legion Armor, and the East Empire Wardens from "Scoundrel's Folly" just wear Steel Armor. So, it is highly recommended that you use [East Empire Company Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54990)﻿ (seen in the screenshots) alongside this mod. It will equip the East Empire Company with a new unique set of armor that will make the faction much more aesthetically interesting.
  
  
Without this mod installed, the East Empire Wardens added to Fort Icemoth will just use the Steel Armor outfit from Scoundrel's Folly.

This mod is incompatible with any mod that also makes changes to Fort Icemoth.
