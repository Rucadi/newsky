**Explore the Waters Below Skyrim**
  
  
The first time I ever entered Blackreach, I quickly dove into the nearest turquoise pool... and was deeply disappointed to find nothing at all. The lakes, rivers, ponds, and waterfalls of Skyrim have so many interesting things under them—so why not the deepest, darkest, weirdest place in the province?
  
  
Here's a good reason to play an Argonian, learn the Waterbreathing spell, or put that stock of potions to use. Underwater Blackreach deepens the submersion experience both literally and figuratively, adding over a dozen new encounters, unmarked locations, points of interest, and Easter Eggs. 
  
  
**Changed Features:**
  
  
This mod was conceived as a Vanilla+ experience. It primarily adds clutter, creatures, and interesting items to Blackreach; there are also a couple areas in which the lake/river bed has been reshaped or deepened. It does not add any quests or location markers.
  
  
A full list of changes to the vanilla game has been posted in the comments section.
  
  
Lore-friendly. Cleaned with SSEEdit. ESL-flagged.
  
  
**Compatibility:** 
  
  

  
* Requires SE; AE is optional.
The Fishing Creation is 100% compatible, and in fact I highly recommend using it if you want the waters of Blackreach to feel more alive.
  
* This mod is unlikely to work well with any other mods that drastically alter the landscape of Blackreach/its waterways. (I've confirmed that it conflicts with Paint It Black; if there are other Blackreach mods you're experimenting with, feel free to check and let me know!)
Confirmed to be compatible with [Unmarked Locations Pack - Blackreach](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/127468?tab=description)﻿ (which I also highly recommend, just because that whole series is excellent).
  
* Confirmed compatible with [Natural Waterfalls](http://https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/87261?tab=files)﻿ Blackreach addon.
Confirmed compatible with Mihail's Blackreach creature mods (Dwarven Colossus, Falmer Abyssraiders, Crystal Golems, and Thri-Kreen Warriors)
  
* Confirmed compatible with [Blackreach - Clockwork City](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92579).
Needs a patch for [The Blackest Reaches](http://https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21280?tab=files&file_id=219081&nmm=1)﻿; there's now one available on the downloads page.
  
* Needs a patch for [Magical Blackreach](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37636?tab=description)﻿; it's now available on the downloads page.
Needs a patch for [JK's Sinderion's Field Laboratory](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68154?tab=description)﻿; now available on the downloads page.
  
* Needs a patch for Amasido's [Blackreach Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/136923?tab=description)﻿; there's one available on the downloads page.
[Blackreach Improved](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/144675)﻿ needs a patch; it's on the downloads page.
