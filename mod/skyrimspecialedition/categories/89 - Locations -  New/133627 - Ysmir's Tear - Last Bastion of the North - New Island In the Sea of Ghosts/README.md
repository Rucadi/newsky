Ysmir's Tear
  
  
In the frigid Sea of Ghosts, an old dockmasters post protects the bitter north of Skyrim. At one point, this location was the pinnacle of Atmoran-Skyrim trade and migration. However, a curse of the Elder Wood left this once great post into disarray and abandon. A custom reward lies as the reward for this location. Do you have what it takes to discover the lost secrets of Ysmir's Tear?
