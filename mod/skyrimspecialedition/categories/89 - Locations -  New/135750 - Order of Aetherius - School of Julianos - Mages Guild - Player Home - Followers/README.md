**The Order of Aethe****rius**

  
Established by mages fleeing the dissolution of the Mages Guild nearly 150 years ago, the **Order of Aetherius** provides a safe place to study magic and preserve knowledge. It is the only **School of Julianos** in Skyrim, though there many to be found elsewhere across Tamriel. As they are affiliated with the Temple of the Divines, the Order of Aetherius is steadfastly opposed to necromancy and the darker magical arts. They are a smaller order that does not seek much political or magical power, but rather seeks to do good works, provide help to those in need, and support the charitable mission of the Temple of the Divines. Originally founded as an order of nuns, they now allow men into their ranks, though they still mostly have women adherents.
  
  
In Skyrim, they are represented by a single chapter hall - the **Mystic Refuge** - located in a remote mountain pass between **Whiterun** and **Ivarstead**. Though they refuse to take sides in the ongoing civil war, the resurgence of the dragons has proven too great a threat for them to remain in seclusion. As such, each member of the Order of Aetherius is willing to put down her books, and take up the staff or sword and join the Dragonborn.
  
  
This mod IS:
  

  
* A new guild of mages with five members, each a spell vendor, a capable companion, and a worthy ally.
Player residence enabled with custom storage and activators, and a nice bedroom just for you (and companion).
  
* Lore-friendly, with unique dialogue and miscellaneous quests to help you get to know your new associates.
Supports an Alternate Perspective start - found in Optional Files.
  
* A nice chapter hall with a teleport spell tome to get back to a decently central location.

  
This mod IS NOT: 
  

  
* A follower warehouse. It doesn't have stacks of spare beds or room for your army of followers. However, the [Scholar's Village](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/150487)﻿ adds a lodge and two houses where additional followers might live.
A mannequin or weapon rack warehouse. It has a few tastefully placed weapon racks, but no mannequins.
  
* A display museum. The Order of Aetherius is not in the business of hoarding magical artifacts - they suggest you consider establishing a museum in Solitude for that ([Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802)﻿).
Adoption or child enabled.
  

  
This mod REQUIRES:
  

  
* EITHER some sort of **[CBBE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/198)﻿/[3BA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30174)﻿** body installed OR some sort of **[UNP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/search/?BH=0)﻿/[BHUNP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31126)﻿** body installed. Any body shape will do - you'll just need one of the two for compatibility with their custom textures. They are all set up to use [OBody](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77016)﻿ should you be running it - as they use your default installed body meshes. Alternately if you really MUST use vanilla bodies, you may download five specific outfits that are either CBBE or UNP and dress the five ladies ONLY in those outfits - to get the textures to match. You'll need hands, feet, and body slots.
[Backported Extended ESL Support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441)﻿ IF you are on a version of Skyrim earlier than 1130.

* The **Mystic Refuge**is set up as a fully featured player home and guild hall. It is intended to feel like a lived-in guild hall that you are welcome to stop over at, or even join yourself. There are a significant number of **custom linked activator storages**, and all other containers and storage locations are fully safe / do not respawn.

  

  
* You can indeed **study magical skills at the Mystic Refuge**. There are eight custom activators in the main hall, one for each magic skill (Alteration, Conjuration, Destruction, Illusion, Restoration, Enchanting, Alchemy) and Smithing. The Smithing activator gives very little training (it's mostly there for lore reasons to represent Aurelia's attempt to learn Smithing) but the other seven activators give respectable training at low levels, though they do not scale up as your skill goes up, so it slows down considerably. Once you get past around skill 35 or so, you'll have to click them a LOT to level up, so it might be better at that point to head out and do some adventuring.

  

  
* All five members of the Order of Aetherius are have full AI packages and will engage in daily life in the guild hall. When you dismiss them, they'll return to the guild hall unless you have chosen for them to live elsewhere using an appropriate mod (My Home Is Your Home, Nether's Follower Framework, etc)
Each of the five members of the Order of Aetherius serves as a **spell vendor of the appropriate school**, with other miscellaneous items available. Though they have a somewhat limited gold reserve, the Master Trader perk will indeed boost their available gold as expected. While they are traveling with you, they will not provide services, but when you dismiss them, their stores will be available once more.
  
  
* Each of the five members of the Order of Aetherius has a **small miscellaneous quest** for you, which include opening up **new areas of the guild hall**, and taking some of the followers out on short excursions. Each quest is **fully voiced** and will integrate thematically with the Skyrim world.
The five followers are set to take advantage of the [Mysticism](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839)﻿, [Arcanum](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23488)﻿, [Apocalypse](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1090), or [Odin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46000) spell packs, receiving a good assortment of interesting spells from these mods through [SPID](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869)﻿ distribution. Of these, Mysticism and Odin are the two most interesting packs, giving the widest range of spells to all of the followers. Using at least one of these spell packs is extremely encouraged, in order to play with the followers as they are intended to be. The included ini distribution files will simply do nothing if you do not have these mods installed, or if you do not have SPID installed.
  
  
* All followers are vanilla voiced but have roughly **100 custom lines**, so they'll feel unique and interesting. They remain compatible with any and all follower frameworks.
The current members of the Order of Aetherius in Skyrim are all women, but they're fine with a man joining their ranks. The women bias represents their historical background as a monastic order affiliated with the Temple of the Divines.
  
  
* Three of the ladies have optional SMP Hairs available as an addon in Optional Files. Each of these hairs is from [Dint999's excellent BDOR Hair Pack](https://www.mediafire.com/file/1enjwvkrgv6iq1q/%5BDint999%5D_BDOR_Hairs_SSE_0.20.7z/file)﻿ which is **REQUIRED**. This links to the same archive that Dint posted on their Discord, listed as Public (I cannot link directly to Dint's Discord due to Nexus rules but a simple Google search will find it - there's LOTS of excellent free stuff on it, truly top notch work).
The ladies all have tattoos as JoShady75 and I both clearly share a love for them. Though we are not making a no-tattoo or no-facepaint version, anyone who wishes to has full permission to do so and post it as an addon mod.
  

  
  
Allow me to introduce you to the five members of the Skyrim Chapter of the Order of Aetherius:
  
  
**Ivy - the Breton Spirit Conjurer and Poison Mage**
  
  
![](https://i.ibb.co/GR7PQ7s/ivylogo.jpg)
  
  
- **Ivy** is the youngest and newest member of the Order of Aetherius. She's a bit impulsive and chaotic, but ultimately has a good heart, and is fiercely loyal to her companions.
  
  
- **Ivy** summons three spirit wolves who will ruthlessly crush things at low levels. As you travel with her and gain experience, you'll both just realize they are only spirit wolves and still die to anything larger than an overgrown tarantula. Thus, Ivy will also have some upgraded spectral animal spells and a number of very interesting poison spells if you use[Mysticism](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839)﻿, [Arcanum](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23488)﻿, or [Odin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46000). Requires [SPID](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869)﻿ for this addition.
  
  
  
  
**Aurelia - the Imperial Paladin of Zenithar**
  
  
﻿![](https://i.ibb.co/ZJHccRZ/Aurelialog.jpg)
  
  
- **Aurelia** is a devout paladin of Zenithar and traveled to Skyrim seeking to serve her patron divine. Finding Skyrim lacking a Chapel of Zenithar, she fell in with the Order of Aetherius, finding that their mission matched her own.
  
  
- **Aurelia** has a few self-healing and alteration spells, and will buff and heal herself while going toe-to-toe in melee. If you have the [Mysticism](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839)﻿, [Arcanum](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23488)﻿, or [Odin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46000) spell packs, she'll have some extra special awesome paladin/sun themed spells, and be a bit more interesting. Requires [SPID](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869)﻿ for this addition.
  
  
  
  
**Frisa - the Nord Blizzard Caller and Frost Mage**
  
  
﻿![](https://i.ibb.co/PmRSDB1/Frisalogo.jpg)
  
  
- **Frisa** joined the Order of Aetherius a little more than a decade ago, and enjoys how the solitude of the Mystic Refuge allows her to study her magic freely.
  
  
- **Frisa** uses frost magic, and will blast her foes relentlessly until they die a cold death. She also might summon a Frost Atronach for some extra assistance. If you have the [Mysticism](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839)﻿, [Arcanum](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23488)﻿, [Apocalypse](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1090), or [Odin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46000) spell packs, she'll have some extra special awesome frosty themed spells, and be a bit more of an icy vortex. Requires [SPID](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869)﻿ for this addition.
  
  
  
**Blaze - the Redguard Fire Sorceress and Atronach Binder**
  
  
﻿![](https://i.ibb.co/D1b0J61/Blaze-Logo.jpg)
  
  
- **Blaze** has been a member of the Order of Aetherius for a bit over a decade now, since she joined alongside Frisa. She finds it a most welcoming home.
  
  
- **Blaze** uses fire magic, and will torch her foes ruthlessly until they are a smoldering heap. She also has a tendency to summon up a Flame Atronach for some extra support. If you have the [Mysticism](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839)﻿, [Arcanum](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23488)﻿, [Apocalypse](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1090), or [Odin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46000) spell packs, she'll have some interesting fire themed spells, and be even more of an flaming tornado. Requires [SPID](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869)﻿ for this addition.
  
  
  
  
**Nyx - the Bosmer Illusionist and Archer**
  
  
﻿![](https://i.ibb.co/GFjRb8p/NyxLogo.jpg)
  
  
- **Nyx** is the longest serving member of the Order of Aetherius in Skyrim, having arrived nearly fifty years ago to help found the chapter hall.
  
  
- **Nyx**uses illusion magic, and will summon up a bound bow to support you from a safe distance (remove her starting hunting bow from her inventory to enable this - it's there in case you recruit her at very low levels where she might have a low magicka pool). If you have the [Mysticism](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839)﻿, [Arcanum](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23488)﻿, or [Odin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46000) spell packs, she'll have some extra special awesome illusion themed spells. Requires [SPID](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869)﻿ for this addition.
  
  
  
**Some things to note**:
  
  

  
* [size=3]Any **CBBE or 3BA texture compatible body**will work.For the **BHUNP conversion** provided by [Yandros](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/OneYandros)﻿, any **UNP or BHUNP texture compatible body** will work. Though all five ladies have custom textures, they will continue to use whatever body you have set up in your game - they're all ready for OBody assignment or regular play without needing to build a single thing in Bodyslide.
  
The **Order of Aetherius** is **ESL Flagged** so is a Light Plugin and will not take a spot in your load order.
  
- It was created with the .1170 version of the Creation Kit thus has a 1.71 header (and will not open in older versions of the Creation Kit).
As it uses the extended ESL range of FormIDs, it absolutely requires [Backported Extended ESL Support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441) for versions of Skyrim pre-1130.
  
- The candles included are ENB/Community Shaders versions - there's a patch in the Optional Files for vanilla candles.
You will also need [Faster HDT-SMP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57339)﻿ for the SMP wigs addon.
  
- Compatibility with Lux, Lux Orbis, and Ulvenwald is provided in the Optional Files.
Check out [Dziet's Auto-Undressing patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30265?tab=files)﻿ for the sauna.
  
- As this is an ESP flagged Light that adds new cells, any patches that edit the cell details should use the Partial Form flag to avoid potential issues. If you're looking at tinkering with image space or lighting, note that I put those into the roombounds, and they should be edited there rather than the cell record.
If the NPCs in your game are bald, that likely means you are using [Racial Skin Variance (RSV)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81668)﻿ or the Nolvus mod list, both of which are notorious for this issue. Consult instructions in that mod / mod list for how to resolve the issue by excluding NPCs. For the updated RSV (SPID) version, it will be as simple [using this patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/152312)﻿.
  
- If you'd like to swing by the [Modharbour Discord](https://discord.gg/ewU53g3r)﻿ for more support, you're quite welcome to.
  
  
**Compatibility:**
  
  

  
* **Compatible** with [High Tavern](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/121358)﻿, no patch required.
**Compatible** with [Forgotten Dungeons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/449)﻿ using the "[High Tavern - Forgotten Dungeons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/134497)﻿" patch (which works perfectly with this mod as well).
  
* **Compatible** with the [Forgotten Dungeons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/449)﻿ + [High Tavern](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/121358)﻿ combination using the "[High Tavern - Forgotten Dungeons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/134497)﻿" patch.
Currently **Incompatible** with [Ancient Falmer Ruins](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/126428)﻿, which adds a huge Falmer wall/temple/ruin at the same location.
