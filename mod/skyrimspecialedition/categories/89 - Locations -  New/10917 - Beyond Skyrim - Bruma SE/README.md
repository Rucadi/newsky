**DO NOT USE NMM**
  
Nexus Mod Manager (NMM) is known to lose or corrupt data when downloading/installing large mods like Bruma. This will lead to loss of functionality or otherwise cause errors with content related to the mod, and is part of the reason the Nexus staff began development on Vortex as a replacement. If you encounter an issue and installed the mod using NMM, you will be asked to reinstall manually before moving on with assistance.﻿﻿

**With Mod Organizer 2 (recommended) or Vortex:**Click "download with manager" or download the archives manually. Once the mod is activated, ensure that both BSAssets.esm and BSHeartland.esm are enabled in your load order and that BSHeartland.esm loads AFTER BSAssets.esm. BS\_DLC\_patch.esp should then follow BSHeartland.esm.
  
  
  
**Manual installation**
  
Download and unzip the archives, and place all contents in your Skyrim/Data folder. Ensure that both BSAssets.esm and BSHeartland.esm are enabled in your load order and that BSHeartland.esm loads AFTER BSAssets.esm. BS\_DLC\_patch.esp should then follow BSHeartland.esm.
  
  
**Uninstallation:**
  
*Uninstalling Beyond Skyrim: Bruma is not supported due to the way that the game engine 'bakes' data into saved games. If you wish to stop using Beyond Skyrim: Bruma, you are STRONGLY advised to roll back to a saved game that predates your installing Beyond Skyrim: Bruma, or start a new saved game.*
  
If you uninstall Beyond Skyrim: Bruma without rolling back to a previous saved game or starting a new one, it is very likely that you will experience bugs. This is due to the way the game engine handles data files, and is true of Bethesda's official DLC as well as other comparable mods.

**Q**: What kind of people are you looking for? How can I join the Cyrodiil team?
  
**A**: We are always on the lookout for talented concept artists, 3D modellers, landscape designers and people skilled with the CK, although we have openings for other positions as well. Just send an application through [Our site](https://beyondskyrim.org), along with a sample of your work. If you have any questions about joining you can ask in [Our Discord](https://discord.gg/JHaTbdTGJD). And if you don't have the skills now, consider joining [The Arcane University](https://discord.gg/dHUyS7DJX8) our training division.
  
  
**Q**: What is Beyond Skyrim?
  
**A**: Beyond Skyrim is an ambitious community, composed of various, independent projects working together to bring the other Provinces of Tamriel - like High Rock, Cyrodiil, Hammerfell and Morrowind - into the game and timeline of Skyrim.
  
  
**Q**: Will it require a new game?
  
**A**: Nope! You will be able to use your existing characters from Skyrim. Just hop over the border, and continue your adventures.
  
  
**Q**: Is this the same thing as Skyblivion / Skywind? Why aren't you working with them?
  
**A**: No, Skyblivion and Skywind are remakes of older Bethesda games in the Skyrim engine. This is an entirely new mod in which the player can visit a version of Tamriel contemporary to Skyrim. Our goals and methods are different, but we keep up a good relationship.
  
  
**Q**: Why not you just port content from Oblivion / Morrowind / other games?
  
**A**: Because this is a violation of Bethesda's EULA, and would be grounds for them to close down the project.
  
  
**Q**: Will this be released for consoles?
  
**A**: Beyond Skyrim: Bruma is now available for Xbox One. We cannot release it on PS4 due to Sony's policies on mod assets prohibiting us from doing so.

We will support Beyond Skyrim: Bruma comprehensively, with patches to resolve any bugs and issues that are reported by players.
  
  
But we're not stopping with Bruma - we're working on the rest of Cyrodiil, too - from the naval heart of Anvil to the swampy marshes of Blackwood and the grandeur of the Imperial City, as part of the wider Beyond Skyrim: Cyrodiil project. Be sure to follow us on our social media outlets to get up the latest news on patches and the continued development of Cyrodiil.
