Want more things to do underwater? Did you enjoy [Underwater Blackreach](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/128143) or [Rivers and Lakes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/146572)? Are you seeking passage to Solstheim? This is the mod for you!
  
  
Underwater Solstheim adds over two dozen encounters, points of interest, marked and unmarked locations, and even small dungeons to the island. Now the "[Jewel of Absolutely Nothing](http://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Solstheim)" has at least *something* beneath its waves. (Also, more fish.) (Why are there so few fish in the original DLC?)
  
  
This mod is ESL-flagged, lore-friendly, Vanilla+, and compatible out of the box with every major underwater content mod. Dive into a world full of pirate tales, treasure chests, Easter Eggs, literal eggs, mysterious magic, and sunken shrines. Explore Dunmeri shipwrecks, ruins from the Red Year, hydrothermal vents, eldritch terrors, and Dwemer mysteries in the depths. The waters of Solstheim await!
  
  
**Q&A:**
  
  
**Is this safe to install mid-game?**
  
Yep, go ahead!
  
  
**Is there a list of everything that this mod adds/changes?**
  
It's in the comments section under spoiler tags.
  
  
**I want more underwater stuff!** 
  
I'm working on similar mods for the Forgotten Vale/Sea of Ghosts/smaller worldspaces, but it's going to take a while lol. In the meantime, check out [Underwater Blackreach](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/128143)﻿ or [Rivers and Lakes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/146572)﻿.
  
  
**What are the requirements?**All the vanilla DLCs—nothing else!
  
  
**Do I need AE?**This mod does not require any CC content; however, I don't provide support for outdated setups. If you're still on game version 1.5 or earlier, feel free to try this mod out, but I make no guarantees.

If you're wondering why the example images look so fuzzy: It's a combination of Nexus' automatic image compression, and Solstheim's ocean being SIGNIFICANTLY darker than Skyrim's. After two days of trying to work around it I just gave up; I promise the actual content isn't NEARLY that grainy or blurry in-game.
