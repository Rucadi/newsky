**Dive Below The Surface**
  
  
Do you love swimming? Are you looking for more wet and wild game content? Do you want to both go chasing waterfalls AND stick to the rivers and lakes that you're used to?
  
  
**Underwater Skyrim: Rivers and Lakes** adds more than 60 new locations, points of interest, Easter Eggs, and exploration opportunities to the game's waterways. This is a vanilla+ experience with a focus on environmental storytelling—discover new ruins, loot, creatures, letters and notes, and even small dungeons and caves.
  
  
The mod also tweaks a few spots to make shallow ponds deep enough to swim in, cause boiling geysers to scald you, or provide secret passages to deeper waters. (Plus, I've added a seat to the hunter's camp at the hot springs; now you can relax in the pool with them!) Swim in the swamps, explore flooded caverns, find abandoned shrines, and make a splash at the docks.
  
  
Take a deep breath—or chug a potion of waterbreathing—and dive in!
  
  
  
**Q&A:**
  
  
**Is there a list of all the things this mod adds?**
  
Yes! It's in the comments section under spoiler tags.
  
  
**What version of Skyrim do I need?**
  
Either AE or a recent version of SE (post 1.6).
  
  
(Why? In order to be compatible with CC Survival Mode, this mod requires Survival Mode as a master. You don't have to USE Survival Mode—it's totally fine to shut it off—but you *do* need to have its files installed.
  
If you're on v1.5 or earlier, I've heard that [BEES](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441?tab=description) is the recommended tool for running a "best of both worlds" setup; you'll want to combine that with the Survival Mode creation. I'm not an expert on running outdated load orders, though, so I'm afraid I can't help you troubleshoot.)
  
  
**What about the Forgotten Vale? The Sea of Ghosts?** 
  
Working on it! This mod is focused on the rivers, ponds, swamps, and lakes in the base game's vanilla map, but I'm hoping to release more underwater mods in the future. In the meantime, you can also check out [Underwater Blackreach](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/128143) and/or [Underwater Solstheim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/157986).
  
  
**Can I install this mid-game?**
  
You sure can!
  
  
**I hate slaughterfish. Are there slaugherfish?**
  
I've added a patch to the downloads page that will kill the slaughterfish added by my mod as soon as they load. However, it won't touch vanilla slaughterfish, and pretty much every area deep enough to make it worth placing something cool is also deep enough for the game developers to have put a slaughterfish there. I recommend combining my patch with one of the many excellent mods for dealing with slaughterfish, such as [Slaughterfish Are Extinct](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19987), [Drop Dead Slaughterfish](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69560), or [One With Nature](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13343).
  
**What's with the roe bed patch?**
  
  
The first version of this mod contained harvestable salmon roe beds in some parts of the White River. Unfortunately these seemed to cause crashing on some people's setups... but not others. Figuring out how and why the crashes happen has proven beyond me, so as of Version 1.1.3, **all roe beds have been removed from the main mod**.
  
  
I've created a patch that adds the roe beds back in with some help from [inaiinai](https://forums.nexusmods.com/profile/76048828-inaiinai/) ﻿(who created a new mesh). I *think* it should fix the problem, but can't guarantee it, because replicating the problem in the first place was such a headache. Use at your own risk.

[inaiinai](https://forums.nexusmods.com/profile/76048828-inaiinai/) created the new mesh for the salmon roe beds, using Klamactus' [Salmon Roe model replacer 3D](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42074?tab=description). Shoutout to them (and to everyone who leaves open permissions on old mods!)
  
  
I've gotten requests for an Xbox version, but unfortunately possess neither the skills nor the console to make that happen. If anyone wants to port it, you have my permission to do so.
