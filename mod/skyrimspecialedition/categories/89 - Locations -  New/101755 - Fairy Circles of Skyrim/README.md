⋆ **Major update in the works!**
  
⋆ Still working on the major update but the most recent version did make a lot of major improvements. The next big update will add on a lot more content and majorly expand upon one of the existing circles. It should be safe to update from 1.0.1 to 1.2.0 mid-playthrough. Report any bugs otherwise.
  
⋆ This is an ongoing project of mine. I plan to expand on or update some of the elements I introduced and plan to add more locations.[/size]
