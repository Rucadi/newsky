![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RoastGorilla439/RoastGorilla439/main/images/Description.png)Journey in the footsteps of a group of mercenaries hired by someone named Marus Antonius, in search of a powerful ring known as the Band of the Wraith. Said ring is in the possession of a necromancer named Silas Marceau, who came out here for his "research" after discovering the fort had been abandoned for around 20 years.
  
Includes new items and skeleton variant from the hit mobile game: The Elder Scrolls: Blades. As well as new dungeons to explore, a Black Book, and a new properly voiced shout (using good quality vanilla splicing)

To travel to the isles, you'll need to reach the Old Wooden Jetty at the most north western beach in Skyrim. Otherwise travel to **Northwatch Keep** and travel **west** until you reach it.
  
**In order for the boat to be usable, you have to read the waterlogged journal in the dead mercenary's inventory.** Which will also start the quest *Siege at Icemoth.*

**Brief lore overview:**
  
Fort Icemoth was a small imperial naval fort. Abandoned around 20 years ago.
  
It provided a safe spot for the East Empire Company to trade whale products with the local nords in Fjolgen. As well as just being a naval base for imperial ships in the Sea of Ghosts protecting trade from corsairs.
  
  
**For Extra challenge enable the Arcane Archer pack and the zombies creations**
  
  
**Notes:**
  
- These islands are sort of based on an extremely vague line from TES Blades mentioning some islands north of Skyrim near High Rock
  
- If you're struggling to find Crimson Kiss It's located: SpoilerIn a chest beside the rear end of Eyndis' Folly (in a small rock opening in the sea floor) 
  
- If you're wondering why I used a Raven Rock house, it's because they're actually EEC colonial houses. 
  
- Winter Shroud Sanctum was originally going to be in Beyond Skyrim Cyrodiil. As well as its dragon claw which I was wanting to include in a museum in the Imperial City. Though that idea was scrapped.
  
- Fully navmeshed and follower friendly 
  
  
(Yes I copied the name from the Siege at Firemoth plugin for Morrowind lol)
