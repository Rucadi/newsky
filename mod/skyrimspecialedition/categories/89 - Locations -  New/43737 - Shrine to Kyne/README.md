A new location with a new shrine to Kyne you can pray at. What you see in the screenshots is what you get.
  
  
It will give you the 'voice of the sky' blessing for 12h (animals won't attack).  It's the same blessing you get by reading all the stone tablets on the way to High Hrothgar.
  
  
  
  
**Installation**
  
1. Dowload one version. Either the Esp or Esl not both. They have the same content.
  
2. Installl with your mod organizer as usual, or drop the file in your Skyrim/Data folder.
  
  
then 
  
  
1. Download the repacked BSA and overwrite
  
  
- The original BSA had some vanilla meshed/models packed in by mistake. 
  
  
- A BSA is a file that has skyrim models or textures etc packed in it, that a mod or the game needs.
  
  
**Compability**
  
It's compatible with everything that doesn't place stuff in the same area as the shrine.
  
  
**Other info**
  
It's  based on Kirkbridge's design document for Skyrim: 
  
[General: The Nords' Totemic Religion - The Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages (UESP)](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/General:The_Nords%27_Totemic_Religion)"The Hearth Gods have temples appropriate to their nature: **Kyne’s are built on peaks**, Mara’s are the halls of important Witches, Dibella’s are the halls of important Wives..."
  
  
  
This was originally part my Windhelm expansion, but it felt a bit out of scope for a city mod. So decided to make it separate.
