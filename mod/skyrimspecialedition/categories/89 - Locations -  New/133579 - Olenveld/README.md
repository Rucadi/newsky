THE MOD MAKES USE OF CUTSCENES! THESE CUTSCENES USE VANILLA ANIMATIONS. HOWEVER. SOME USERS REPORTED THAT RUNNING YOUR ANIMATION TOOLS (IF YOU USE ANIMATIONS AND ANIMATION REPLACES) LIKE NEMESIS FIXES THE CUTSCENES. This is not a mod issue. It can be a simple modlist issue or technical incompatibility. If you have custom animations in your game and the cutscenes don't work. Give it a try to regenerate stuff

  
Olenveld is a new lands mod, the size of a small DLC, bringing the lore location of Olenveld to Skyrim. It introduces a unique questline and an island recapturing system.
  
  
This mod took approximately **3,000 hours** of Creation Kit work, spread across nearly seven years of my life as a passionate hobby project. (meaning It was not a full time job activity) there are **52 weeks in a full time job per year**, this mod would be equivalent to **75 work weeks**.
  
  
Please be kind and respectful when reporting bugs or issues (and this applies to all, just be kind fellas, world is already full of hate). I will do my best to address any concerns.
  
Consider this mod a thank-you gift to the Elder Scrolls community for all the joy, mods, and adventures since 2011.
  
  
**You can start the mod by going to septimus signus outpost, walk behind that glacier and going forward until you see a cabin, once inside, pick up the note and venture forth!**

**[b]?** [/b]WHAT IS OLENVELD**[b]?**[/b]

  
Olenveld is referenced in the book "The Exodus" in Skyrim, telling a tale both eerie and intriguing. This small island, a day’s sail north of Winterhold with good winds, was long forgotten and is said to have been used by Tiber Septim as a burial ground for his conquest's casualties—a haunting landmass filled with the fallen.
  
In Olenveld, you won’t be recognized as the Dragonborn. The island’s inhabitants are so isolated from mainland Skyrim that even the main Skyrim questline is unknown to them. You arrive as a mere mortal, seeking answers, attempting to understand what went wrong, and discovering how to help and restore the island.
  
Expect to face fearsome undead foes and waves of relentless enemies. Your decisions will determine the island's fate.
  
You’ll also encounter new enemies, find fresh equipment, and gain access to a stunning location ideal for screenshots (looking at you, ENB Graphics Snipers!).

Olenveld alters only one cell in the Tamriel landscape to place the cabin that initiates Olenveld’s main quest
  
  
[CELL:000038B7] (in Tamriel "Skyrim" [WRLD:0000003C] at 29,38)
  
  
Otherwise, Olenveld exists in its own worldspace and **does not** interfere with any other worldspace from the base game.
  
The mod has been tested with both a clean save and a mid-playthrough save, with no errors found. However, for large mod lists, I recommend double-checking compatibility before assuming Olenveld is the cause of any issues.
