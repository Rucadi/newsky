**Description****New mod in Unmarked Locations Series. Explore forgotten halls and libraries of the Apocrypha, find other seekers or what's left of them, find yourself in unexpected places, search for rare books and manuscripts (all added texts are completely lore friendly). Navigation through new locations is done in vanilla style, through the network of books that act as portals.**
