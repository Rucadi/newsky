Deep beneath the slippery steps of Hrothgar, the Snow Tower lies sundered, kingless, bleeding...

  
  
Or so it’s been told. In truth, the empty halls of long forgotten kings are brimming with life, mischief, and abnormalities that we're really better off without. Descend to the depths of Henantir's Steamcrag and explore the Blackest Kingdom Reaches and the colorful bunch of lost souls that have made this place their home.
  
  
  
Henantir's Steamcrag (HSC) is a short term modding project developed by the students of the [Arcane University](https://beyondskyrim.org/au). It's an opportunity for students to collaborate across departments and experience mod development in a structured learning environment, while receiving in-depth feedback and creating work to a higher standard.
  
  
To begin your journey into the depths of Henantir's Steamcrag, two familiar figures can be found entertaining themselves within the Honningbrew Meadery. Speak to them, and they will gladly point the way towards the hidden entrance. Alternatively, you may find the entrance yourself on your travels north of Ivarstead.
