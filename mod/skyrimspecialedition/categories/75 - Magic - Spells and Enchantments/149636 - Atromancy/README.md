**Overview**
  
Atromancy can be defined as a branch of Conjuration magic dedicated to summoning Elemental Daedra, known as Atronachs. Using the [Custom Skills Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41780), this mod adds a custom perk tree that features 25 new perks, which provide various benefits depending on the type of Atronach (Flame, Frost, Storm) that has been summoned. You can unlock these perks by spending regular perk points.
  
  
This perk tree also has its own leveling system. There are two ways to increase your Atromancy level:
  
  
1. Every time you summon an Atronach, there is a chance that your Atromancy skill level will increase. The stronger the Atronach you summon, the more likely you are to level up. So for example, summoning a Frost Atronach would yield a greater chance of raising your Atromancy level than summoning a Flame Atronach. 
  
2. Whenever your conjured Atronach defeats an enemy in combat, there is a chance that your Atromancy level will increase.
  
  
The lesser power required to access the perk tree can be obtained by reading its respective spell tome. This tome can be acquired by crafting it at the Atronach Forge. Refer to the Atronach Forge section for the recipe. You can also access the perk tree if you are using [Custom Skills Menu - A Custom Skills Framework Unified Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62423). **However, i****n order to start increasing your Atromancy level, you MUST first read the spell tome and learn the lesser power as this tome also grants the ability to level up the Atromancy skill.

**Elemental Rupture (30)**: Your conjured Sun Atronachs explode upon dying, dealing 40 points of sun damage to undead enemies and causing them to burn for 10 seconds.
  
**Elemental Affinity (40/70)**: While you command a conjured Sun Atronach, your health regeneration rate is increased by 25/50% and Sun spells are 25/50% more powerful.
  
**Elemental Veil (50)**: While you command a conjured Sun Atronach, you gain a sun cloak during combat.
  
**Elemental Synergy (50)**: While you have a Sun spell equipped, your conjured Sun Atronachs last four times as long.
  
**Elemental Wrath (60)**: While you command a conjured Sun Atronach, consecutive hits from Sun spells on undead enemies causes an explosion of light that deals extra damage and has a chance to cause them to flee from combat.
  
**Elemental Infusion (60)**: While you command a conjured Sun Atronach, both you and the Atronach gain a glowing light that follows you and illuminates your surroundings. Allies that go near this light have their attack damage and magic resistance increased by 20% for 10 seconds, while undead enemies that are exposed to this light have their attack damage and magic resistance reduced by 20% for 10 seconds.
  
**Elemental Overload (70)**: While you command a conjured Sun Atronach, casting Sun spells may emit a pulse of light that restores 50 points of health to you and nearby allies, while undead enemies suffer 50 points of sun damage. Your Atronach's attacks also have a chance to emit this light pulse.
  
**Elemental Bond (70)**: Transfer your soul into your conjured Sun Atronach and take control of it for 30 seconds. While in control of the Atronach, its attack damage and movement speed is increased by 50%. It will automatically attack any enemies on sight. When the Atronach takes damage, you suffer part of the damage as well. If the controlled Atronach is slain, your Sun spell damage and health regeneration rate are reduced by 50%, and you cannot summon another Sun Atronach for 300 seconds.
  
**Elemental Awakening (80)**: Your conjured Sun Atronachs constantly emit a healing aura that restores 20 points of health per second to nearby allies.
  
**Elemental Attunement (90)**: Equipping a Sun spell grants your conjured Sun Atronachs a Sun ward. Sun spells that hit this ward are deflected and fully heals the Atronach. Equipping a Fire, Frost, or Shock spell grants the Atronach immunity to the respective element.
