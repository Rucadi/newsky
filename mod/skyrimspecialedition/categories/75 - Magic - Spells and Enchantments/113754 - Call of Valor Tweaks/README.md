**Description**
  
  
I found the [Call of Valor](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Call_of_Valor) shout was very underwhelming. It's supposed to be a reward for completing the main quest. Just one summonable hero isn't a lot and I ended up never using it. As such, I changed the Call of Valor shout, in an attempt to make it more useful:
  
  

  
* Using one word summons [Gormlaith Golden-Hilt](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Gormlaith_Golden-Hilt).
Using two words summons [Gormlaith Golden-Hilt](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Gormlaith_Golden-Hilt) and [Felldir the Old](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Felldir_the_Old).
  
* Using three words summons [Gormlaith Golden-Hilt](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Gormlaith_Golden-Hilt), [Felldir the Old](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Felldir_the_Old). and [Hakon One-Eye](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Hakon_One-Eye).

  
I increased the duration to 120 seconds. (up from 60)
  
  
In addition, I've buffed the 3 of them, so they can actually hold their own in battle. I also gave them new and better outfits, weapons, perks, shouts, classes and combat styles.
  
  
I have included an optional which doesn't have completing the main quest automatically unlock the words of Call of Valor. You will need to spend Dragonsouls to unlock them. (see optional file "Dragonsouls Reqs".)
  
  
I also added a patch which changes their outfits back to Vanilla. Note that they will be significantly weaker if you choose this.

**FAQ**
  
  
Q: ESPFE?
  
A: Yes.
  
  
Q: Does installing/updating/uninstalling on an existing save work?
  
A: As far as I know, it should. However, it's good practice to keep a backup save prior to doing this, just in case.
  
  
Q: Is this compatible with <insert mod>?
  
A: I don't know by heart. You might need to check yourself.
  
  
Q: Will you make a patch for <insert mod>?
  
A: Only if it's a mod I use myself or plan on using it, I have enough time and I actually like the idea. Otherwise, feel free to do it yourself. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: I have a suggestion to improve the mod. Can you do it?
  
A: Maybe, if I have time and I like the idea, I'll consider it.
  
  
Q: Will you port this to <insert platform>?
  
A: No, I myself only support the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If someone else wants to port it, feel free. (see permission) If you decide to port it, you yourself take full responsibility to offer support to said port. I will not provide no support for any ports by third parties.
  
  
Q: I use a ported version of this mod on <insert platform> and I have a problem. Can you help?
  
A: I don't provide any support for third party ports on other platforms than the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If you have issues, you should adress the person that ported it.
  
  
Q: Does this work on Skyrim 1.6+, aka "Anniversary Edition"?
  
A: Yes, it should.
  
  
Q: Why don't your mods use MCMs and instead use this janky console command system to set globals?
  
A: I am not a fan of MCMs. You can set the globals by making a patch in xEdit. I have no plans of changing this. If you want to add an MCM, feel free. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: Why don't you use FOMODs?
  
A: That would require reuploading the entire mod, in question, even if I only make a small change. My internet is limited and reuploading the files each time will take a huge chunk of my monthly volume.
