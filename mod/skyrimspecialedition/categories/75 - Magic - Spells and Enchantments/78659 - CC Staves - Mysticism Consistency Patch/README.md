The new models of staves from the CC have some gorgeous designs, and it's always fun to find a good new staff with a unique design. I wanted variants of the Mysticism staves that would use these new designs. So I made this mod.

  
  
Details:
  

  
* Every staff variant added by Mysticism can now come in the vanilla staff style or any of the 8 new styles introduced by the Staves CC
All staves are manually integrated into leveled lists in order to accommodate tier changes and vendor specific tweaks introduced by Mysticism, and can all also be crafted
  
* [size=3]The initial start-up quest for the CC has been disabled to accommodate this change[/size]
All staves now use the proper magic skill associated with their spell
  
* The Thunderbolt staves now use Thunderbolt rather than Lightning Bolt
The unique staves included in the creation have completely nonsensical scaling and do not mesh well with Mysticism, and have therefore been removed from any integration
  

  
Compatibility:
  
This mod will interfere with any changes made to many staff leveled lists for Vanilla and Mysticism. Make sure to check the CK or SSEEdit to see if this is being overwritten or is overwriting anything, and create a patch for the lists.
  
  
Installation:
  
This mod works best on a new save in order to disable the initial start-up quest from the CC, but it is not mandatory. The leveled list changes will take effect regardless, though you may need to wait for a merchant's inventory to reset. I do not recommend uninstalling this at any time during a playthrough, and will be unable to provide any troubleshooting assistance if you decide to do so.
  
  
Requirements:
  
Both the Staves creation and [Mysticism - A Magic Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839) are required.
