This is a tiny mod so I'll keep it brief. This tiny addon to Extended Cut: Saints and Seducers seeks to make the actual Saints and Seducers summons unique. It does this by HEAVILY drawing inspiration from "The Elder Scrolls Legends" card game.

  
  
**The Actual Changes**
  
  
**Saints** - The Guardians of Mania will now summon an additional copy of themselves IF you have more Health than your enemy.
  
**Seducers** - The Guardians of Dementia will increase your health regen by 300% for 3 seconds whenever they strike an enemy.
