[font=bebas\_neuebook]Installation[/font]
  
  
This mod can be installed during a playthrough. Once installed, the mod will start adding the new content to your game after 60 seconds. This delay is designed to avoid the script load spike that occurs immediately after game launch if many mods have been installed and are running initialisation scripts simultaneously.
  
  
Vendors will only start selling the new tomes, scrolls and staves once their inventory resets after being left alone for 48 hours. This is a vanilla Skyrim feature and is by design.

Apocalypse partners with [Odin - Skyrim Magic Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46000?), which improves and fixes vanilla magic and adds new spells inspired by previous Elder Scrolls games. Both mods integrate seamlessly with each other and are designed with a similar look and feel.
  
  
My mods include a wide variety of overhauls and expansions for various game systems. See [my profile page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3959191) for a full list.
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]FAQ[/font]
  
  

  
* **Can NPCs use these spells:** No. Modifying a large number of NPCs to use the new spells would cause unacceptable compatibility issues. To add spells from mods to NPCs, use [SPID](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869), the Spell Perk Item Distributor.[/\*]
**Vendors are not selling the spells:** As in vanilla, vendors only sell spells up to your skill level in the magic school, so check for novice spells. If they are not selling them, but are selling vanilla spells, see if you have a mod that modifies the same vendors, which could cause a conflict where the mod that is loaded last wins. If they do not have any vendor dialogue, they may be in a quest where their quest dialogue takes precedence over their vendor dialogue, or they may be trying to sleep (most NPCs do not sell at night).[/\*]
  
* **Concentration spells (like Bombardment) stop working:** There is a Skyrim bug where concentration projectile spells can stop working after heavy use. To fix this, reload the game. This bug also affects vanilla concentration spells like Unbounded Flames.[/\*]
**Circle spells (like Circle of Death) stop working:** There is a Skyrim bug where hazard spells can stop working after heavy use, or even turn against the caster. To fix this, reload the game. This bug also affects vanilla hazard spells like Guardian Circle.[/\*]
  
* **Ocato's Recital used to store 3 spells but now only stores 1:** Apocalypse 10.x changed Ocato's Recital from 3 to 1 spells, but adds Medora's Memory and Silmane's Spell Sentinel that each store 1 additional spell, with slightly different effects. Separating the spell into three at different skill levels results in an improved power curve.[/\*]
