**Notes**
  
** Moon spells cause sun damage, they benefit from sun perks.
Moon spells are the "frost" counterpart of sun (fire) spells. They do not damage stamina.*
  
  
**Power**
  
  
**Power List**
  
  
Spoiler
  

  
* **Lunar Body** - Your attacks deal additional damage to undead for 10 Magicka.
  
**Notes**
  
** Powers are lesser powers.
Spells that add damage to your attacks have a base damage of 10. Their damage is increased on heavy attacks and is more effective on two-handed weapons than one-handed. The spells do not stack with spells that do the same from my other mods. Only one can be active at the same time. Spells are toggleable.*
  
  
**How to get them**
  
  
They also get sold by a new Merchant found in the Temple of Mara with the [Dareni's Spells - Merchants](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/109762) addon.
  
Optional SPID file for items can be found from Khajiits.
