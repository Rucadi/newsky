The spells are integrated into the leveled lists. They will begin to spawn in spell merchants inventories after a few in-game days.
  
  
Alternatively, you can obtain all of the spells by defeating the newly-added boss. They can be found at the Horker Island/on top of Gyldenhul Barrow in Solstheim. They are quite difficult even for high-level characters with no mods, so be prepared!
  
  
[size=2]These spells do not benefit from elemental perks. They are designed to be support spells for impeding opponents' actions more than being actual offensive spells.
  
These spells can be used by followers and NPCs.[/size]
