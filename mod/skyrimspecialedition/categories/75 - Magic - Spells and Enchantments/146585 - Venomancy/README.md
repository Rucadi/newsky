[left]**﻿Overview**
  
  
I've always wanted to do a dedicated Poison Mage playthrough, so I originally made this mod for personal use. Although there are a lot of great magic mods out there that add Poison-themed spells, I wanted to expand the existing selection and add perks and mechanics that could support a full Poison Mage playstyle. There are two versions of the mod. A Destruction version where the damage-dealing poison spells are in the Destruction School and a Restoration version where these spells are in the Restoration School. This mod adds 40 Destruction/Restoration spells, 77 Conjuration spells, 11 Alteration spells, and 8 Restoration spells. The spell tomes are safely injected into leveled lists via a script that only runs once, so no Bashed Patch is required. The spells are sold by the College of Winterhold's spell vendors and will only appear when the player has reached the required skill levels. The master-level spells require the completion of their respective Ritual quests. There are also staves for some of the spells that can be crafted at staff enchanters.
  
  
This mod includes two custom perk trees that utilize the [Custom Skills Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41780). The **Venomancy** perk tree focuses on providing enhancements to the damage-dealing poison spells from this mod. Due to the sheer number of creature summoning spells in this mod, the **Vile Invocation** ﻿perk tree serves to complement them with a variety of perks that enhance their capabilities. The lesser power required to access these perk trees can be obtained by reading its respective Spell Tome. The Venomancy Tome can be purchased from Faralda or Colette (depending on the version of the mod you're using). Phinis will sell the Tome for the Vile Invocation perk tree. Alternatively, you can access the perk trees if you're using [Custom Skills Menu - A Custom Skills Framework Unified Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62423).﻿
  
  
Venomancy also features three new poison-themed shouts and three boss encounters. These shouts are learned by reading a Tome that can only be acquired from defeating the respective boss. In addition to the shouts, these bosses carry items with unique effects.
  
  
This mod has [SkyPatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106659?tab=description) integration that distributes some of the spells and items to certain NPCs. Various venomous creatures such as Chaurus and Frostbite Spiders have also been granted poison effects from this mod, which should make them notably more deadly and make poison resistance more useful as few things in the base game actually deal significant poison damage. SkyPatcher is optional and is not strictly required for the rest of this mod to function.[/left]
  
**Spells**
  
  
The spells in this mod are divided into four different subtypes: **Poison**, **Plague**, **Malodorous**, and **Acid**. Each of these spell subtypes have unique qualities and complement each other when used in combination.
  
  
**Poison** spells focus on damage and slowly wear down the target's health with damage over time (DoT) effects. This poison DoT does not stack with itself. When used against targets that are afflicted with the **Plague** status effect, Poison spells gain additional bonus effects that further enhance their effectiveness.
  
  
**Plague** spells deal less damage than the other types of spells, but instead aim to cripple and weaken the target with a variety of debilitating debuffs. Plague spells cause targets to become plagued, which is a weaker DoT effect that does not stack with itself but does stack with poison DoT effects. Targets that perish while suffering from plague effects will spread these ailments to nearby enemies upon dying. When used against targets that have been rendered especially susceptible to poison (-70% or less poison resistance), Plague spells can inflict even more powerful effects to further impair targets.
  
  
**Malodorous** spells specialize in disorienting targets with a variety of effects. Unlike Poison and Plague spells, Malodorous spells do not inflict any DoT effects. Instead, these spells induce the **Nausea** status effect. When targets become nauseous, they lose 20 points of stamina whenever they attack and lose 20 points of magicka whenever they cast a spell. In addition, if a nauseous target becomes **Poisoned** or **Plagued**, they will constantly vomit putrid bile that does 20 points of poison damage, induces nausea, and reduces poison resistance by 20% for 20 seconds. This bile can harm both allies and enemies. Like Poison spells, Malodorous spells also have secondary effects that become active when they are used against targets suffering from the **Plague** status effect.
  
  
**Acid** spells serve as a means to mitigate a particular weakness shared by most forms of Poison magic. Generally, Undead and Mechanical enemies tend to be highly resistant or outright immune to poison. Acid spells allow dedicated Venomancers to effectively combat these enemy types by dealing twice as much damage when used against them. Similar to Poison spells, Acid spells can inflict poison DoT and also reduce armor rating, which makes them effective against other types of enemies as well. Furthermore, after acquiring the necessary perk, Acid spells can cause Undead and Mechanical enemies to become **Corroded**, which completely nullifies their poison immunity and renders them vulnerable to Poison, Plague, and Malodorous effects. When used against **Plagued** targets, Acid spells can cause enemies to dissolve into a puddle of goo if their health is low enough. However, Acid spells are the least common form of Poison magic and can only be learned by progressing far enough into the perk trees as only the most experienced Venomancers can attain mastery over this type of magic.
  
  
**Other Status Effects**
  
  
In addition to the standard **Poison** status effect, there are a few additional status effects that stack with the other status effects. Only certain spell effects can inflict these status conditions.
  
  
**Lingering Poison** causes damage over time and upon wearing off leaves the target more vulnerable to poison by reducing their poison resistance by 10% for 20 seconds. 
  
**Volatile Poison** causes damage over time and makes targets violently explode when they are struck by a Poison, Plague, Malodorous, or Acid spell. This explosion sends them and nearby enemies flying while also spreading Volatile Poison to them. 
  
**Virulent Poison** causes damage over time and after a short delay produces a small cloud of damaging poison from the afflicted target that briefly lingers in the area before dissipating. This poison cloud will still spawn even after the target has perished.
  
**Wither**causes damage over time and ignores poison resistance. Casting Poison, Plague, Malodorous, or Acid spells on withered targets spreads Wither to nearby enemies and may cause paralysis.

Only humanoid targets (humans and elves) may be transformed into Afflicted Ghouls.
  
  
**Perks**
  
The two custom perk trees featured in this mod serve to further enhance the lethality of aspiring Venomancers as well as bolster the capabilities of the various summoned creatures that they have at their disposal. [size=2]All of the summons in this mod are referred to as Virulent Summons. The perks can be acquired by reaching the necessary skill levels and spending perk points. Venomancy perks use the Destruction/Restoration skill (depending on the version of the mod you're using) and the Vile Invocation perks use the Conjuration skill.[/size]
  
  
**Venomancy** **-** *"Master the deadly, esoteric art of Venomancy and unleash agonizing poisons to cripple and devas*tate your *enemies."*
  
Spoiler
  
**Lethal Venom(30/60)****:**Poison spells are 25/50% more potent.
  
**Tainted Blood(40)****:**Your blood is now toxic. Poison resistance is increased by 50%. When you are attacked, nearby enemies have a chance to get splashed by your blood, which poisons them and may cause them to flee from you for 5 seconds.
  
**Poisonous Fumes(70)****:**Enemies killed by poison have a chance to explode upon dying and leave behind a persistent cloud of deadly poisonous gas that inflicts Lingering Poison and reduces poison resistance by 20% for 20 seconds.
  
  
**Pervasive Contamination(40/70)****:**Plague spell effects last 50/100% longer.
  
**Sickly Aura(60/80)****:**Plagued enemies that get too close to you have their poison resistance reduced by 20/50% for 20 seconds.
  
  
**Robust Immune System(40)****:** Become immune to the ill effects of nausea and restore 20 points of health when hit by the bile from nauseous targets.
  
**Robust Immune System(70):**While nauseous, the potency of Poison, Plague, Malodorous, and Acid spells is increased by 15% and all spells cost 15% less magicka to cast. Anyone that goes near you becomes nauseous as well.
  
**Draining Vapors(80)****:**Gain the "Draining Vapors" power. While nauseous, you can use this power to purge yourself of these toxins and expel it as a vile gas that induces nausea, does 20 points of poison damage, and absorbs 20 points of magicka and stamina per second.
  
  
**Corrosion(50)****:**Acquire knowledge of Acid magic and learn the Acidbolt spell. At Restoration skill level 75, learn the Acid Spill spell. At Restoration skill level 100, learn the Acid Rain spell. Acid spells deal twice as much damage to undead and mechanical enemies.
  
**Corrosion(70)****:**Acid spells cause undead and mechanical enemies to become corroded, which temporarily nullifies their poison immunity for 20 seconds.
  
  
**Wither(100)****:**Poison, Plague, Malodorous, and Acid spells may inflict Wither. Wither ignores poison resist and stacks with Poison and Plague damage. Casting Poison, Plague, Malodorous, or Acid spells on withered targets spreads Wither and may cause paralysis.
  
  
  
**Vile Invocation** -*"Call forth the most putrid and abhorrent creatures to do your bidding."*
  
Spoiler
  
**Virulence(40)****:**Casting Poison, Plague, and Malodorous spells on Virulent Summons gives it certain effects. Poison: Causes the Virulent Summon's attacks to inflict Virulent Poison. Plague: Grants a Plague Cloak to the Virulent Summon. Malodorous: Spawns vile slime from the Virulent Summon that restores 20 points of health to allies and induces nausea.
  
**Vile Warden(50)****:**If you have a Poison spell equipped, one additional Virulent Summon can be summoned. If you have a Plague spell equipped, Virulent Summons last four times as long. If you have a Malodorous spell equipped, Virulent Summons cost 50% less magicka.
  
**Contagion(70):**On death, Virulent Summons release a virus that reduces the poison resistance of nearby enemies by 5% every 5 seconds for 20 seconds. While infected, enemies with -100% poison resistance abruptly die and explode, which spreads the virus to nearby enemies.
  
  
**Virulent Binding(50)****:**Bound poison weapons are stronger and have the following effects on plagued targets. Sword: Reduces attack damage by 20% for 15 seconds, Axe: Reduces armor rating by 100 points for 15 seconds, Bow: Reduces movement speed by 20% for 20 seconds, Dagger: Has a chance to paralyze for 5 seconds.
  
**Virulent Binding(70)****:**Bound poison weapons reduce poison resistance by 20% and inflict Virulent Poison for 20 seconds. Has a chance to spawn a Poison Wyrm from the corpses of slain targets that will aid you in combat for 60 seconds. Blight Summons also gain these effects.

**Toxic Influence(50)****:**Nearby Chaurus and Spiders become friendly and are compelled to fight for you. In combat, when you're near Virulent Summons, you and the Virulent Summon gain a Poison Cloak and your Poison, Plague, Malodorous, and Acid spells are 25% more potent.
  
**Venomous Symbiosis(60)****:** When your health, magicka, or stamina drops below 50%, absorb 20 points per second of the respective stat from nearby Virulent Summons. Virulent Summons absorb health from you and each other when their health drops below 50%.
  
**Venomous Symbiosis(80):** While you command a Virulent Summon, enemies slain by you or your summons have a chance to cause Virulent Summons to release a curative gas that restores 20% of health, magicka, and stamina to the summon and its allies.
  
  
**Infestation(100)****:**While you command a Virulent Summon, casting any spell has a chance to trigger an explosion that damages enemies and spawns a Poison Wisp to aid you in combat for 60 seconds. It will periodically proliferate to spawn additional copies of itself.
  
  
The Vile Invocation perk tree also includes access to three permanent Daedric summons that all have powerful abilities and grant a number of buffs to their master. They do not count towards your summon limit and scale with your current level, so they will grow stronger as you level up. However, only **ONE** of these summons may be chosen as picking one will bar access to the other summons. When these Daedra are defeated in combat, they are sent back to Oblivion and must take 5 minutes to recover before they can be summoned again. As you establish a deeper bond with them, they grant even more powerful boons. However, upon reaching the final tier, when your connection to these putrid Daedra is forcefully disrupted, you will be stricken with various debilitating curses that will persist until your summon has recovered. The effects of these curses varies depending on the Daedra that you formed a pact with.
  
  
**Baleful Tyrant(60)****:**Form a pact with a powerful Fiend of Decay and gain it as a permanent summon. It can dissolve itself into a cloud of poisonous gas and rematerialize at its enemies location with its Decay Shift ability. Use the "Baleful Tyrant" power to dismiss it.
  
**Baleful Tyrant(80)****:**The Fiend does more damage and gains 200 points of health. Its attacks now reduce poison resistance by 50% and inflict Lingering Poison. When it kills an enemy, your Poison, Plague, Malodorous, and Acid spell potency is increased by 25% for 30 seconds.
  
**Baleful Tyrant(100)****:**While summoned, the Fiend bestows to you its Decay Shift spell and raises your movement speed and Poison, Plague, Malodorous, and Acid spell potency by 50%. If the Fiend is killed, you suffer the inverse of these effects and are poisoned until it returns.
  
  
The Fiend of Decay has high attack power and can quickly close the distance between it and its enemies by teleporting to them with its unique "Decay Shift" ability. Its attacks inflict Virulent Poison. Upon attaining the final rank of the "Baleful Tyrant" perk, if the Fiend perishes in combat, your movement speed is reduced by 50% and Poison, Plague, Malodorous, and Acid potency is reduced by 50%. You are also stricken with a Daedric Poison that will constantly drain your health and cannot be cured by any means.
  
  
**Decay Shift\*** **-**Aim at a target to dissolve into a cloud of poisonous gas and rematerialize at the target's location. Costs 80 magicka per use and has a 20 second cooldown.
  
\*Decay Shift is an Alteration spell that will only appear in your spell list while the Fiend is currently summoned. You can only teleport towards living targets.
  
  
**Baleful Aberration(60)****:**Form a pact with a voracious Rotten Charyboid and gain it as a permanent summon. It can devour enemies with low health, causing it to temporarily grow in size and strength whilst venting life absorbing gas that absorbs 20 points health per second from enemies and replenishes you. Use the "Baleful Aberration" power to dismiss it.
  
**Baleful Aberration(80)****:**The Charyboid gains 300 points of armor and 50% magic resist. While enlarged, nearby enemies may flee from it. When it kills an enemy, you regain 100 points of health and your Poison, Plague, Malodorous, and Acid spells cost 25% less for 30 seconds.
  
**Baleful Aberration(100)****:**While summoned, the Charyboid raises your armor by 300 points, magic resist by 50%, and reduces Poison, Plague, Malodorous, and Acid spell cost by 50%. If the Charyboid is killed, you suffer the inverse of these effects and are poisoned until it returns.
  
  
The Rotten Charyboid gains 200 points of health and armor rating whenever it consumes an enemy. These buffs do stack, which can allow it to become monstrously durable if given the chance. However, it must continue to feed in order to maintain its size and buffs. Its attacks inflict Virulent Poison. Upon attaining the final rank of the "Baleful Aberration" perk, if the Charyboid perishes in combat, your armor rating is reduced by 300 points, magic resistance is reduced by 50%, and Poison, Plague, Malodorous, and Acid spells cost 50% more magicka to cast. You are also stricken with a Daedric Poison that will constantly drain your health and cannot be cured by any means.
  
  
**Baleful Overseer(60)****:**Form a pact with a morbid Infested Caller and gain it as a permanent summon. It can spawn Daedric Parasites that infest corpses, turning them into Infested Thralls. Use the "Baleful Overseer" power to dismiss it.
  
**Baleful Overseer(80)****:**The Caller gains the Tendril Snare and Tendril Cloak spells. It can now also summon an Infested Warlock to aid it in combat. When it kills an enemy with its staff, you can summon one additional Virulent Summon for 30 seconds.
  
**Baleful Overseer(100)****:**While summoned, the Caller bestows to you its Staff of Pestilence and raises your magicka by 100 points. You can summon two additional Virulent Summons. If the Caller is killed, you suffer the inverse of these effects and are poisoned until it returns.
  
  
The Infested Caller wields the powerful Staff of Pestilence, which shoots beams of toxic energy that inflicts Virulent Poison, greatly slows enemies, and replenishes your magicka by 20 points per second. The Daedric Parasites that it spawns will also replenish your magicka by 20 points whenever they attack enemies. Tendril Cloak is a unique spell that only the Infested Caller has access to. It shrouds itself in tendrils that burst out when enemies get too close, which damages them and may knock them down. Upon attaining the final rank of the "Baleful Overseer" perk, if the Caller perishes in combat, your magicka is reduced by 100 points and you cannot summon any creatures. You are also stricken with a Daedric Poison that will constantly drain your health and cannot be cured by any means.
  
  
**Staff of Pestilence\*** **-**Summon the Infested Caller's deadly Staff of Pestilence for 120 seconds. It fires sickening rays of energy that inflict Virulent Poison, restores 20 points of your magicka per second, and renders targets greatly slowed. Sheathe it to dispel.
  
\*Staff of Pestilence is a Conjuration spell that will only appear in your spell list while the Caller is currently summoned.
  
  
  
**Items**
  
There are several items with special effects as well as staves for some of the spells. These items can only be acquired from defeating the bosses. The staves can be crafted at staff enchanters. If you're using SkyPatcher, you can also encounter certain enemies wielding the staves as well as poison-enchanted items.

However, the poison gradually contaminates its body and drains its health. Upon dying, the accumulated virulence is released, which triggers a shockwave of poison that damages nearby enemies. Killing plagued enemies with this weapon replenishes 10% of its charge.
  
\*Reward for defeating the Afflicted Scourge.
  
  
  
**Bosses**
  
Three boss encounters await anyone that dares to challenge them. These bosses are intended for high level players, so they are quite strong and have a few tricks up their sleeves. Make sure you are well-prepared before you face them. Having high poison resistance is recommended.

**FAQ**
  
**Q:** Is this mod compatible with \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?
  
  
**A:** Probably. I designed this mod with compatibility in mind. No direct edits were made to vanilla records. The scripted leveled list injection ensures future compatibility with mods that make changes to leveled lists.
  
  
**Q:** ESL-flagged?
  
  
**A:** Yes.
  
  
**Q:** Why did you make two versions of the mod?
  
  
**A:**While most mods that add poison spells tend to classify them as Restoration, I've never really been a fan of the Restoration school being able to fulfil the role that the Destruction school normally does as I feel that it homogenizes the schools of magic and kind of takes away from their identity and specializations. Poison magic was also classified as Destruction in previous games, so some Morrowind fans may appreciate it! Regardless, there is a Restoration version for those that prefer it.
  
  
**Q:** Can you make a patch for \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?
  
  
**A:** I'm not taking requests. I may make patches that allow poison spells from other mods to benefit from the perks in this mod, but for everything else I will leave that to the community as permissions for this mod are open.
