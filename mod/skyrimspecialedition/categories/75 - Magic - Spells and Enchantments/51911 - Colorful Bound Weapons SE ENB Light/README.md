Non ENB Light
  
[SE Version](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37268) | [LE Version](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/104176)

  
  
Originally a Mod by [renzozuken1](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/2760235), seen [HERE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/70132), was abandoned only after having the mod up for about 3 **WEEKS** in October of  2015. As Fallout 4 landed, the author scrapped the project and hid it. I actually LOVED the original release, and took pictures for the mod, only for it to just be canned. This has been a WIP of mine for ***five goshdarn years.*** I'm glad I'm able to finally (re?-)release it.
  
  
Each color is a standalone spell, which can be found as spell tomes above the Markarth Stables in a [Inconspicuous Knapsack](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/37268/37268-1592093705-1848064472.jpeg). There is also a large set of standalone equipable weapons you can use but for now they are only accessible via console or use of [AddItemMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17563).
