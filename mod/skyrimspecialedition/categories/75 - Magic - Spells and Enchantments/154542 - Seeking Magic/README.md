**Overview**
  
Seeking Magic is a highly advanced and powerful form of magic, accessible only to the most skilled and seasoned practitioners of the arcane arts. These spells possess the ability to track their targets with unnatural accuracy and precision, as though the magic itself were guided by a will of its own. When first called upon by the caster, these 'Seekers' will passively orbit around the caster. When a viable target is in sight, the Seekers will launch themselves at the target and will continue to pursue them until either the spell's duration has expired or the caster has been slain. Naturally, this makes facing practitioners of this magic exceptionally challenging, as their spells are notoriously difficult to evade or counter. However, the Seekers do not travel very quickly and take a second or two to detonate once they have reached their target. Certain forms of Seeking Magic serve more benign purposes, offering a range of supportive benefits to allies as well. There are a total of 18 spells, divided among the five schools of magic. These spells can be purchased from various spell vendors once you reach the appropriate magic skill level. The master level Elemental Seekers spell requires the completion of the Destruction Ritual quest before it becomes available for purchase. The spell tomes are safely injected into leveled lists via a script that only runs once, so no Bashed Patch is required.

This mod uses the power of SkyPatcher to distribute some of the spells to NPCs. Consequently, you might find certain combat encounters a little more challenging...
