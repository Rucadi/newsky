There is no need to troublesomely use or disarm the horse summoning magic, or get off or mount it.
  
  
Activating this ability once will allow you to ride a horse at any time while Sprinting

There are three powers: Shadowmere, Arvak, Drake.
  
  
  
After activating the power you want to use, ~~press the E key for 1 second while Sprinting summon a horse and ride it automatically.~~
  
  
**Pressing the E key while sprinting will summon a horse and mount it automatically.
  
  
Hotkeys can be changed in MCM.**
  
  
  
  
If you stop sprinting, use up all your stamina, fall into water, stagger, or become ragdoll, the summoning will be automatically canceled.
  
  
  
When you gallop on a phantom horse, you can gallop for a long time because stamina consumption is greatly reduced compared to when you normally sprint.
  
  
  
  
~~This also applies to NPCs and followers when they wear the Phantom Horse Ring. However, the difference from the player is that the horse is summoned at the same time as the gallop begins.~~
  
  
  
**Followers wearing the Phantom Horse Ring will ride the Phantom Horse accordingly when the player rides the Phantom Horse.
  
  
To make a follower who missed the ride on time ride the Phantom Horse, simply press the hotkey again.**

Additionally, players can use it in dungeons, indoors, and during battle, ~~but NPCs and followers can only use it outdoors and outside of combat.~~
  
**Followers will also summon Phantom Horses in the same manner as the player, but can also focus on combat during battles.**

If the timing is odd when summoning a horse like above, you need to activate one of the conditions in the sprint animation mod you are using.
  
  
[Dynamic Sprint](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/95561) users can resolve this issue by updating to the latest version.

Please find the animation in question through the OAR log and check "interruptible" to enable it.

I think most other issues you'll encounter are due to not properly installing the required mods or OAR priority issues.
