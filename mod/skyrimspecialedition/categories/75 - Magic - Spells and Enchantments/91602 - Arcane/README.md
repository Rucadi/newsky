* **Arcane Body** - Your attacks deal additional magic damage to health and twice as much to magicka for 10 Magicka. Damage to health is tripled against enemies without magicka.
  
**Notes**
  
** Powers are lesser powers.
Spells that add damage to your attacks have a base damage of 10. Their damage is increased on heavy attacks and is more effective on two-handed weapons than one-handed. The spells do not stack with spells that do the same from my other mods. Only one can be active at the same time. Spells are toggleable.*
  
  
**How to get them**
  
  
New Vedors: Mirailde in the Windperk Inn in Dawnstar and Dryore in the Bee and Barb in Riften.
  
They also get sold by a new Merchant found in the Winterhold The Frozen Hearth in Winterhold with the [Dareni's Spells - Merchants](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/109762) addon.
  
Optional SPID file for items can be found from Warlocks.
  
  
**Requirements:**
  
  
[Scrambled Bugs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43532)﻿ enable: Perk Entry Points: Apply Multiple Spells
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
  
Load before any mod that changes interiors like Lux or other lighting mods.
  
Arcane was created to be used together with Mysticism and Adamant, but they are not mandatory.
