# Mascot's Integrated Creation Club Spells (MICCS) using SPID
- Author: Mascot
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

Ever thought it odd how only the Dragonborn can learn the new Creation Club spells? They're supposed to be lore friendly, some returning from previous games. So why can only one person learn them?
  
  
The idea of this MICCS (Pronounced "mix") is to fix that. Using SPID, it adds the Creation Club spells to NPC's with the appropriate name, so you will see Necromancers summoning anything from Zombies to Bone Colossus, mages casting Elemental Flare, and any other spells I can find and add, based on the NPC's appropriate skill level.
  
  
Any mods that add Creation Club armor to NPC's, or use SPID, shouldn't conflict with this. This is my first mod, so let me know if there are any issues. Because of how I've got it setup, this should work with AE, non-AE and even VR setups where the creations are currently installed. 
  
  
If there are any change's you would like to see, frequency of these spells appearing, please let me know, and I'll try accommodate.
