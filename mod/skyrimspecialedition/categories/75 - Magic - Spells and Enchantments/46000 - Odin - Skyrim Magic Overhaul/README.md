[font=bebas\_neuebook]Improved vanilla spells[/font]
  
  
Odin improves, fixes and rebalances vanilla magic. Changes include:
  
  

  
* Scrolls and staves are no longer weaker than their equivalent spells or missing effects entirely.[/\*]
Scrolls and staves now include the necessary effects to support certain perks.[/\*]
  
* Descriptions are more descriptive and show the actual damage values.[/\*]
Area effects are no longer blocked by small obstacles, other targets, or uneven terrain.[/\*]
  
* Self buffs and conjured minions are no longer erroneously eaten by Spell Absorb.[/\*]
Spells with a level cap still work on targets above their level cap but have a chance to fail based on the difference.[/\*]
  
* Spells have more consistent visuals and sounds.[/\*]
...[/\*]
  

  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]New spells[/font]
  
  
Odin adds new spells that respect the history of the Elder Scrolls series. The new spells are designed to be interesting to use and to look and feel like official content. While some other magic overhauls may add more spells, Odin aims to avoid unnecessary spell clutter. Every spell is designed to be a useful addition to a mage's repertoire.
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Integration into Skyrim[/font]
  
  
Odin is seamlessly integrated into Skyrim. The new spell tomes, scrolls and staves can be bought and looted from the same sources as vanilla equivalents of the same level.
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Full list of spells[/font]
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Alteration[/font]
  
  
In vanilla Skyrim, the School of Alteration offers little more than paralysis and some underwhelming utility. Odin adds a wider selection of disabling spells at lower levels, brings back classic Elder Scrolls debuffs such as elemental and physical weakness, adds spells to weaken locks without making the Lockpicking skill itself irrelevant, greatly improves Telekinesis, and adds numerous utility and quality of life spells that do not directly increase power but make life as a mage a bit more comfortable.

Improvements to vanilla Alteration spells
  

  
* Improved Alteration casting visuals are provided for all buffs including vanilla ones.[/\*]
Armor spells are not directly buffed, because they have perk support and other mods affecting them like Cutting Room Floor, so any change to them is a compatibility conflict waiting to happen. However, Ocato's Spell Trigger eliminates the need to manually cast them, as does Ocato's Preparation in Vokrii and Ocato's Recital in Apocalypse.[/\*]
  
* Light spells are brighter and affect a larger radius.[/\*]
Telekinesis does more damage (2\*Alt level). This is further improved by the telekinesis perks in Vokrii.[/\*]
  
* Telekinesis no longer grants absurd amounts of experience.[/\*]
Equilibrium is replaced with an effect that is not completely useless.[/\*]
  
* ...[/\*]

  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Conjuration[/font]
  
  
Summoned minions now scale with character level, up to 15 levels (10 for novice spells) above their starting level, gaining increased damage, spell magnitude and improved attributes. Reanimation spells are much more effective due to their increased duration, making it easier to carry reanimated minions to the next fight. Dead Thralls are no longer easily lost forever. There are more dremora to choose from with unique roles. There are spirit animals for the shaman in you. Pure summoners are more viable due to the Entropic line of concentration buff spells that make minions more effective at the cost of occupying a hand.

Improvements to vanilla Conjuration spells

Thralls are significantly more powerful than their equivalent Atronachs.[/\*]

Reanimated minions now teleport to the player if they get more than 500ft behind.

This is a Skyrim quirk and there is no script free way to circumvent this. Running a script in the background for something that is only an issue because people are not aware of it is not worth the cost.)[/\*]

Odin gives School of Destruction mages more agency. It adds new elemental spells that trade area of effect or range for damage, allowing players to take more risks in return for higher damage output or vice versa. It also adds new elemental weapon buffs and touch range spells for battlemages. All new spells use custom visuals designed to blend in with vanilla spells and feel satisfying and impactful. Vanilla master spells are significantly improved, and vanilla cloak and wall spells now display the correct amount of damage.

Improvements to vanilla Destruction spells
  

  
* Frost slow is now a fixed value of 50% and no longer affected by fortify effects (preventing it from going over 100% and becoming ineffective).[/\*]
All shock spells now do equal damage to Health and Magicka, instead of some dealing equal damage and some dealing half Magicka damage.[/\*]
  
* All direct damage spells from adept level onwards are viable.[/\*]
Missing expert level scrolls have been added.[/\*]
  
* Cloak and wall spells now display the correct amount of damage.[/\*]
Cloak spells are slightly more effective and dual casting now increases duration instead of range. (Cloaks go through walls, so a massive range gets cheesy.)[/\*]
  
* Wall spells now scale with dual casting.[/\*]
Rune staves are no longer ludicrously expensive to use.[/\*]
  
* Runes are not buffed directly because Ordinator features perks that buff runes and the next Vokrii update will feature a similar perk. Perk support for runes is cleaner than a series of Greater Rune spells that do exactly the same thing as the lesser ones but with more damage.[/\*]
Explosive spells no longer miss targets behind other characters or even small terrain undulations.[/\*]
  
* Experience gain for explosive spells is no longer reduced by an unrealistically severe amount.[/\*]
Master spells now deal damage comparable to dual cast expert spells instead of much less.[/\*]
  
* Blizzard is no longer nerfed by your own frost resistance.[/\*]
Note: Destruction being weak in the late game is due to the lack of scaling, which is an issue with the skill, not the individual spells. Use a magic scaling mod or a perk overhaul like Vokrii or Ordinator to scale Destruction damage.[/\*]
  
* ...[/\*]

  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Illusion[/font]
  
  
The School of Illusion now offers more ways to kill opponents without needing to divert to other schools. To solve the issue where Illusion falls off a cliff once the opponents exceed a certain level, mind affecting spells and effects will now work on targets above their level cap but with a chance to fail that increases based on the difference. The school now also offers anti-magic tools and temporary damage spells from the old mobile Elder Scrolls games.

[font=bebas\_neuebook]Restoration[/font]
  
  
The School of Restoration now offers more potent damaging spells, including a line of poison spells that harm the living. Wards have been improved with lower costs and the ability to scale into the late game. Healing spells now have different effects instead of being simply linear upgrades. The huge number of redundant Turn Undead spells has been reduced, and they now work like Illusion spells in that they can affect targets above their level cap but with a failure chance that increases based on the difference. More self buffs have been added.

Improvements to vanilla Restoration spells
  

  
* Sun spells can now be found as random loot, and in the form of scrolls and staves.[/\*]
Healing in vanilla Skyrim has a very short cast time and therefore very little cost. This makes it almost always the right choice in combat, and in turn makes it mandatory for every mage build. Odin changes the Expert level version to a (subjectively much more satisfying) concentration effect, so there is an actual cost and a reason to choose not to heal. This also offers counterplay to enemy mages healing.[/\*]
  
* The Adept level cast and forget healing spell now applies its effect over a few seconds instead. This eliminates the vanilla Skyrim issue where survival often depends on twitch reflexes and getting heals off before the damage lands, rather than any tactical planning.[/\*]
Healing is slightly more expensive in terms of mana.[/\*]
  
* The Necromantic Healing line of heal undead spells that can be bought from the Volkihar are now Health transfer spells instead of straight healing spells, setting them apart from healing spells for people.[/\*]
There are no longer 8 different ways to make undead flee.[/\*]
  
* Turn Undead spells now use the Repel Undead wave projectile. There was no reason to have both and the wave is a unique feature.[/\*]
Poison Rune has been reskinned to match Enairim poison spells.[/\*]
  
* Poison spells work on dragons.[/\*]
Wards are much cheaper to cast and rapidly regenerate even in combat, but no longer grant an armor bonus.[/\*]
  
* (1.5.0 and later) Wards no longer scale with Restoration perks and bonuses as in earlier versions (this breaks their visuals) but their regeneration rate is increased and does scale, giving them much improved staying power.[/\*]
Wards do not block like shields. This feature cannot be implemented for NPCs and is very script heavy.[/\*]
  
* Note: wards take damage equal to a spell's base damage, so the adept ward can block 4 Incinerate spells or 6 Fireball spells.[/\*]
Circle of Protection now grants experience.[/\*]
  
* Bane of the Undead now burns for its entire duration, and does sun damage instead of fire damage.[/\*]
Vampire's Bane is now a hostile spell.[/\*]
  
* Dawnguard sun spell tomes no longer erroneously look like Destruction tomes.[/\*]

[font=bebas\_neuebook]Compatibility[/font]
  
  
Click [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/2844) for a list of (in)compatible mods.
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Installation[/font]
  
  
This mod can be installed during a playthrough. Once installed, the mod will start adding the new content to your game after 90 seconds. This delay is designed to avoid the script load spike that occurs immediately after game launch if many mods have been installed and are running initialisation scripts simultaneously.
  
  
Vendors will only start selling the new tomes, scrolls and staves once their inventory resets after being left alone for 48 hours. This is a vanilla Skyrim feature and is by design.
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Recommended mods[/font]
  
  
Odin partners with [Apocalypse - Magic of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1090?), which does not change vanilla magic but adds a collection of 175 new spells. Both mods integrate seamlessly with each other and are designed with a similar look and feel.
  
  
My mods include a wide variety of overhauls and expansions for various game systems. See [my profile page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3959191) for a full list.
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]FAQ[/font]
  
  

  
* **Can NPCs use these spells:** No. Modifying a large number of NPCs to use the new spells would cause unacceptable compatibility issues. There is a separate third party mod available: [Odin Spells for NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46877). To add spells from mods to NPCs in general, use [SPID](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869), the Spell Perk Item Distributor.
**Vendors are not selling the spells:** As in vanilla, vendors only sell spells up to your skill level in the magic school, so check for novice spells. If they are not selling them, but are selling vanilla spells, see if you have a mod that modifies the same vendors, which could cause a conflict where the mod that is loaded last wins. If they do not have any vendor dialogue, they may be in a quest where their quest dialogue takes precedence over their vendor dialogue, or they may be trying to sleep (most NPCs do not sell at night).[/\*]
  
* **Concentration spells (like Taldam's Scorcher) stop working:** There is a Skyrim bug where concentration projectile spells can stop working after heavy use. To fix this, reload the game. This bug also affects vanilla concentration spells like Unbounded Flames.[/\*]
**Circle spells (like Circle of Ash) stop working:** There is a Skyrim bug where hazard spells can stop working after heavy use, or even turn against the caster. To fix this, reload the game. This bug also affects vanilla hazard spells like Guardian Circle.[/\*]
  
* **Why does this mod not include a "telekinesis that picks up enemies" spell:** Odin combines naturally with Vokrii - Minimalistic Perks of Skyrim, which features a perk that adds this functionality to any telekinesis spell when dual cast.[/\*]
**Does this mod still have spells that overlap with Apocalypse:** All overlapping spells have been replaced in version 3.x, so there is no longer any overlap with Apocalypse. On the contrary, both mods now augment each other. For example, Odin's Mark and Recall is a lower level variant of Apocalypse's Milestones and Odin's Destroy Living is a higher level variant of Apocalypse's Slay Living.[/\*]
