**Mysticism - A Magic Overhaul**

  
Mysticism is a complete overhaul of Skyrim’s magic system designed to balance existing spells and add powerful new magical effects to the game. Mysticism fixes bugs in Vanilla magic, fills in gaps in the game's skill progression, and adds new spells from previous Elder Scrolls titles. These spells are designed to feel like they belong in the world of Skyrim, both mechanically and aesthetically. By adding new spells and re-balancing existing spells as part of the same project, Mysticism is able to offer users a coherent and balanced magical experience throughout the early, middle, and late game.
  
**Features**
  
  

  
* Hundreds of bug fixes and balance adjustments to Vanilla spells
Expanded lore-friendly archetypes such as poison and sun spells
  
* Gameplay improvements such as one-handed Master spells and adjusted cast times
Almost 200 new spells added to the game’s vendors and loot

\* The game won’t display decimal points in damage numbers on spell tooltips; however, the damage itself works just fine. A spell that does 4.5 damage for 10 seconds will deal a total of 45 damage. I’ve included the actual numbers on this page so you can calculate your damage accurately when making a build.[/color]

[/color]**Staff and Scroll Mechanics**
  
  
In Simonrim, staves and scrolls benefit from the perks in their relevant schools. With the exception of perks for dual casting (which staves and scrolls cannot do), all magic perks work with staves and scrolls. In addition, skill scaling for magic schools reduces the cost of staves by up to 50%. Enchanting provides extra cost reduction and a recharge perks for staves, as well as damage and duration perks for scrolls, which allow them to compete with spells for viability. Using a staff or scroll enchanter grants Enchanting experience. 
  
  
Scrambled Bugs comes with several settings that allow staves and scrolls to generate experience for their relevant school. These settings are: Staff Experience, Scroll Experience, and Staff Experience Ignore Enchantment Cost. For the best results, I recommend turning all three of these values to true.
  
  
**Vendor Changes**Mysticism makes several changes to vendors to support its goals. The most significant change is that all spell vendors should now sell a respectable number of staves and scrolls. Staves and scrolls will be sold based on your skill in the relevant magical skills. Master staves cannot be purchased and must be created at a Staff Enchanter. Since it is not possible to craft scrolls in the Vanilla game, College mages will sell Master scrolls when you complete the appropriate ritual quest.
  
  
In addition to these changes, Mysticism also makes sure that each school of magic has at least one Expert vendor outside of the college. Mysticism also turns Festus Krex and Feran Sadhri into spell vendors. Finally, Mysticism distributes some spells only to specific vendors. For more information, click the spoiler below. 
  
  
Spoiler**Special Vendors:**
  

  
* *Spells that absorb Health, Magicka, and Stamina can be purchased from Feran Sadhri, Festus Krex, or Enthir. Sadhri sells Master spells when you reach 90 in Destruction; Enthir sells Master spells when you finish the Destruction Ritual quest.*
*Conjure Death Hound, Conjure Gargoyle, Conjure Volkihar Hound, and Conjure Gargoyle Brute can only be purchased from Feran Sadhri. Conjure Gargoyle Brute becomes available when you reach 90 in Conjuration.*
  
* *Ash spells (both in Alteration and in Conjuration) are sold by Talvas. Master spells are sold when you reach 90 in Alteration or Conjuration, respectively.*
*Ancestor spells are sold by Talvas. Master spells are sold when you reach 90 in Conjuration.*
  
* *Conjure Boneman, Conjure Mistman, and Conjure Wrathman can only be found in the Soul Cairn.*
*Conjure Seeker and Conjure High Seeker can only be found in Apocrypha.*
  
  
**Mysticism - Jump Spells Addon**
  
  
The Mysticism - Jump Spell Addon adds two new spells to the Alteration spell list, Leap and Springheel. These spells increase your jump height by five and ten times, respectively, and they require powerofthree's tweaks as well as Better Jumping. I added these spells because it's fun to jump over houses, but it is possible to use them to get into some trouble. You can probably jump over the walls of a city and, without Open Cities or a similar mod installed, find yourself in a strange alternate version of the town, or you might skip a trigger box or otherwise sequence break a quest mod. There's very little risk of permanent harm, but please enjoy these spells responsibly. 
  
  
**Compatibility** 
  
  
Mysticism makes extensive edits to Vanilla leveled lists for spells. As with all mods that edit leveled lists, you may need to use a tool such as Wrye Bash to create a patch for your leveled lists, especially if you have more than one mod that edits the leveled lists for spells. 
  
  
Mysticism is compatible with almost all other spell packs, especially mods like Apocalypse and Forgotten Magic Redone. I do not recommend combining Mysticism with Odin and will not offer support for users who try to do this. 
  
  
Mysticism edits a small number of merchant chests in order to distribute spells, staves, and scrolls. Only one NPC is touched (Festus Krex), so Mysticism will not cause black face or any incompatibilities with NPC overhauls. Most of my changes to merchants will be compatible with other spell packs (so if you have both Mysticism and Apocalypse downloaded, Festus will sell Apocalypse spells).
