*Lost Grimoire SSE* is a standalone spell pack mod that adds a variety of new spells, scrolls, and staves to all 5 of the schools of magic.
  
  
**All the new spells are lore-friendly, well-balanced, and highly polished to provide the best VFX and SFX experience.** The new spells were designed to both fill in the gaps left behind by the vanilla spells, and also add new exciting ways to role-play.

* 115+ new spells across each school of magic to compliment and round-out the vanilla spells
Spell tomes are distributed automatically to vendors, including Master ritual spells
  
* All new spells also come in scroll and staff form, which are distributed in the world
Light-weight, no continuously running background scripts
  
* Standalone design, should be compatible with everything!

  

﻿

  
  
For those of you familiar with the [original Lost Grimoire mod for Skyrim LE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60796), this SSE version is a total remake - rebuilt from the ground up using the programming and design skills I have spent a decade honing since the original mod came out. You will find brand new spells alongside some returning favorites, plus greatly improved balance, visuals, and lots of squashed bugs.

[font=Georgia]F. A. Q.[/font]

[color=#6d9eeb]**Q: Does X mod need a patch?**[/color]
  
**A:** Probably not. Most mods won't need a patch at all. Perk overhaul mods might benefit from patches, to allow their new perks to "see" the new spells, but your game won't have any issues if you don't have a patch. 
  
  
**Q: Can you make this mod an ESL?**
  
**A:**I don't like to do that for a big mod; you can't just edit an ESL, you have to un-ESL it, make your changes, then re-compact the form IDs and re-ESL-ify it. It's a lot of hoops to jump through, and I'm always nervous that it's going to break existing saves, especially if I need to remove old stuff. And there's no way I'm going to manually edit form IDs for a mod this big, I'm just not.
  
  
**Q: Can you port this mod to Xbox?**
  
**A:** It's not possible right now, since you can't currently have SKSE on XBox. If that ever changes...
  
  
[color=#6d9eeb]**Q: Spell X from this mod already exists in another mod...**[/color]
  
**A:** Any large spell pack mod is very likely going to have some functionality overlap with other large spell pack mods; there are obvious gaps in the vanilla spell list that need filling (such as Night Vision) and since spells are usually named after what they do, duplicate names are also common. There are no functional problems caused by having 2 spells with the same name; you can stack up as many standalone spell pack mods as you want without issue. 
  
  
**Q: Okay, but why should I use YOUR version of X spell?**
  
**A:** I've invested literal years of effort into making each of my spells the best possible version of itself; for example, I feel that I have created a much improved version of the classic "mark-and-recall" spell in "Dimensional Door", both in terms of its mechanics and its VFX/SFX. Same thing with my Bound gear and tools. I would encourage you to give the spells in Lost Grimoire a try for yourself - you might just find some new favorites. :)
  
  
**Q: The spells in this mod are too weak/too strong!**
  
**A:** I balanced Lost Grimoire around the vanilla difficulty level and existing vanilla spells. If you have a mod that make Skyrim much more difficult overall, the LG spells won't keep pace. In that scenario, I would encourage you to look into making a consistency patch for your particular setup, or find someone to do it for you. I can't tailor LG to fit every player's individual game setup, sorry.
  
  
[color=#6d9eeb]**Q: Where are the necromancy spells?**[/color]
  
**A:** The necromancy spells that I would consider "cannon" for Lost Grimoire are already part of the CC project I created, Necromantic Grimoire. So if you have Skyrim AE, you're all set!
  
  
**Q: Can I use a patch for the LE version of Lost Grimoire with this mod?**
  
**A:** Nope! Any patches or addons for the LE version are completely incompatible; this is a totally different mod under the hood.
