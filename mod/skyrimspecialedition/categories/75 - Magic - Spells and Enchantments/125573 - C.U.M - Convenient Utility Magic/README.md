﻿**New in 1.2:** You may need to save and load for the mod to work properly (just once, will work fine after that)
  
Spoiler
  

  
* Druid's scythe should now be noticeably slower with low alteration, and noticeably faster with high alteration, especially when dualcasting. Refer to the video to see the difference.
Druid's Scythe can now find ingredient from mods without a patch, so long as they are a tree or flora object, activators still need to be patched. (think things like bees, dragonflies, etc)
  
* The mod will now detect if you are using [Shovels Bury Bodies](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52984?tab=files)﻿ and/or [Sweeping Organizes Stuff](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51645?tab=files), and allow for bound versions of those tools to be summoned. Neither are required, my mod will simply ignore those features if those mods aren't present.

  
1. To summon the bound shovel, simply cast the spell while targeting a dead body and not in combat.
To Summon the bound broom, simply cast the spell while targeting one of the items you wish to sweep up and while not in combat. 
  
2. Both have custom models for their respective animations. (the broom's not that good, sorry guys :c)
﻿
  
  
  
You're a mage. So why are you still digging around in the dirt for ingredients like a peasant?
  
  
The souls of Daedra are molded to the form of massive battleaxes and mystical bows at your very whim, so why are you lugging around that pickaxe all the time?
  
  
No more! Now, with the power of C.U.M the tedium of these tasks is once again reserved for the magically impotent. 
  
  
**Druid's Scythe -**
  
An alteration spell which harvests the ingredients around you. Both the radius and speed scale with your alteration skill, and dualcasting doubles the base value of both. Doesn't steal ingredients, if you wanna steal stuff, you're gonna have to do it the old fashion way.
  
  
**Lucky Lorenz' Tool Bag -**
  
Our lucky friend's bag grants the holder the ability to summon a set of bound tools. What's more, it always summons the right tool for the job! 
  
  
A contextual Conjure Bound Tools spell, that detects nearby ore, woodchopping blocks or water and conjures up the appropriate tool. That's why the C in C.U.M stands for 'contextual.' 
  
  
All the tools come with the proper visual effects, summoning animations, and, if you have [Animobject Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/75167), will be used during the appropriate furniture animations (wood chopping, mining ore veins, and even fishing)
  
  

  
* esl
fully compatible with both [Simple Fishing Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/103440)﻿ and [Fish Anywhere With Water](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60915)
  
* Out of the box compatibility with [Shovels Bury Bodies](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52984?tab=files)﻿ and/or [Sweeping Organizes Stuff](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51645?tab=files) (neither are required)
