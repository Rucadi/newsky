Form 44, 1.71, ESL patch for Dibella's Compulsion.
  
  
I also include the source for a modified version of the script that will undress all armor slots, but to avoid making the original mod completely redundant and keep it as a requirement, if you want it you will have to compile yourself. But don't worry, it's extremely easy!
  
  
Here's how, using the Creation Kit (you don't actually have to load any plugin to do it):
  
**[b]N.B.: YOU NEED TO EXTRACT THE SCRIPTS.zip THAT COMES WITH THE CREATION KIT IN [b]Data\Scripts\Source!**
  
MO2 USERS NEED TO MANUALLY PLACE THE .PSC IN THE Data\Scripts\Source FOLDER OR USE [PCA!](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23852)﻿[/b][/b]
