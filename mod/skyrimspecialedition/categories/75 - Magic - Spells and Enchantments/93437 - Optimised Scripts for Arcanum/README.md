*Optimised versions (mostly small micro-optimisations) of some of the scripts used by the Arcanum - A New Age of Magic mod. Requires the original mod. Does not change any functionality except for improving efficiency.*

  
  
[/color]Requirements
  
- The original Arcanum mod. Specifically, I recommend the [Fixed version uploaded by ConfusedEnoch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65221).
  
- SKSE
  
- [powerofthree's Papyrus Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22854)
  
- [PAPER](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73849)﻿ (version 2.1.0 or greater)
  
  
  
Changes made by this patch
  
[color=#ffffff][size=3]- Small micro-optimisations in scripts.
  
- [size=4][size=3]No changes in functionality (aside from possibly some improvements in efficiency). [/size][/size]
  
  
  
[/size][/color]Installation
  
[color=#ffffff][size=3]- Same as any other standard mod, recommend installing using a Mod Manager.
  
- Note that this is not a full mod, just a patch.
  
- Clean saving should not be required, though to be 100% safe, try to create the saved game for which you first install this file in a quiet
  
place with no combat going on (minimising the chances of any major scripted events being currently active).  
  
  
  
[/size][/color](In)compatibilities
  
[color=#ffff00][size=4][color=#ffffff][size=3]- [/size][/color][color=#ffffff][size=3]If you have any other mods that patch/adjust/change/modify Arcanum's scripts, **make sure to load them after and let them overwrite my files in your mod manager**. [/size][/color]**Exception: load the [Fixed version of Arcanum](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65221) before my files, letting mine overwrite**.
