"Behold! The Nested Illusion! With even the lightest touch, the illusion makes way, changes shape, and welcomes the curious into its embrace. An illusion that begets still more illusions!"
  
- Maelmoth's Marvelous Masterpiece By Maelmoth, Master of Illusions, 2nd Era*

  

**INTRODUCTION**

  
This mod adds a series of illusory decoy spells to confuse, distract, and debuff enemies.  Decoys look like exact copies of the player.  But beware, attacking a decoy can cause debilitating secondary effects! Inspired by the Mesmer from Guild Wars 2 and the Illusion spells from Dungeons and Dragons.

﻿"Now there are two of them!"

  
Novice level decoys are mostly just annoying distractions, but higher level spells retaliate with powerful secondary effects when destroyed.  The most powerful illusions can even affect physical reality!

Once you learn the "Toggle Decoy Command" spell, you can toggle whether or not created illusions can be commanded.  When the power is toggled on, created illusions will go wherever you are pointing when you press the "Activate" key (Default: E).  Pressing (Tab) stops commanding the decoy.  Cast the toggle power to disable decoy command, returning newly created decoys to their default behavior.

**ATTRIBUTES OF THE ILLUSORY DECOY**

  

  
* Appearance is identical to the player, including the same face, hair, armor, and weapons (including modded gear!).
Decoys are merely illusions, which means they are dispelled when they take any damage.
  
* When a decoy is destroyed, feedback from dispelling the illusion staggers the attacker and makes them vulnerable to extra damage for a brief moment.
Decoys do not count towards the Conjuration summon limit.  You can have decoys and conjuration summons. However, only one decoy spell can be cast at a time.
  
* When you learn the "Toggle Decoy Command" power, you can command decoys to move to the location of your choosing using the Activate key (default: E).

**Requirements & Installation**

Recommended to install using a mod manager of your choice.
  
  

  
* Requires the latest recommended version of SKSE for your version of Skyrim
Requires SkyPatcher to seamlessly add the spells to the vanilla levelled lists without breaking compatibility or requiring any patches. If you don't care about adding spells to vendors, or you have an alternative way to acquire the spells (e.g. console commands), then SkyPatcher is technically not required.
  
* ESL flagged - doesn't count towards mod limit

  
  
**F. A. Q. and Compatibility**
  
**Q: Is this compatible with magic and perk overhauls?**
  
A: Decoys cast vanilla spells and copy whatever perks the player has. If a spell pack modifies a vanilla spell (e.g. Odin) or perk (e.g Ordinator), the decoys should use the modified perks and modified vanilla spells automatically
  
  
**Q: Is this compatible with custom bodies, weapons, armors, hairs, etc**
  
A: Yes, the decoys are exact copies of the players and their equipment
  
  
**Q: Can NPCs use these spells?**
  
A: No, they are meant to be player only
  
  
**Q: The decoy died, but it didn't cast the effect I expected!**
  
A: Decoys have to aim the spells, just like the player. Sometimes they can miss.
  
  
**Q: Why is a decoy using a weapon I don't want them to use?**
  
A: Decoys will always use a copy of the strongest weapon in your inventory
  
  
**Q: Why isn't a decoy using my staff weapon?**
  
A: Decoys are excluded from making copies of staffs, for balance reasons
  
  
**Q: I thought decoys weren't supposed to do damage?**
  
A: Decoys have a damage multiplier of 0, but skills, perks, and weapon enchantments can cause them to still do some damage
  
  
**KNOWN ISSUES**

  
* **VERSION 1.2:**Killing a decoy by friendly fire can get you expelled from the College of Winterhold, Dark Brotherhood, etc. To fix this issue, just install version 1.4 and overwrite all files.
**ALL VERSIONS:** A user reported that you could receive a letter of inheritance from yourself.  Unfortunately, this is a vanilla bug. You can get letters of inheritance from yourself and even from hostile NPCs like bandits. I probably can't fix this bug, but I also have not yet run into it myself in all my time playing with this mod.
  

  
  
**PERMISSIONS**
  
I consider this mod to be more or less open source. Feel free to make and release your own patches, tweaks, bug fixes, etc.  If you'd like to include these spells in your mod, just let know.  If you'd like to release your own spell pack based on these spells, go for it.  I just ask that you send me a message and give credit, because I like learning what people are creating.  If you find a bug, let me know and I will try to fix it.
