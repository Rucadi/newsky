This mod remodels the helmet meshes from the awesome mod Bound Daeric Armour by Sagittarius22 to fit properly on some of the more neglected races.
  
I used the shape and 3D geometry of Navida1's awesome Improved Close-Faced Helmets and sort of brute-forced the shape and original mesh together.
  
  
Only contains some meshes and an ESP, no scripts.
  
  
With the blessings of Sagittarius22 and Navida1, I have been permitted to upload this here for anyone who may want it.
  
  
Don't forget to endorse the original mods!
  
  
Requires Bound Daedric Armour to work "duh".
  
 The improved Close-Faced Helmets mod is not needed, but still worth the download.
  
  
Why make this? OCD and boredom mainly ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯
