* **Necrotic Fire Body** - Your weapon attacks deal 10 magic damage and reduces enemy weapon damage by 10% for 3 seconds for 10 Magicka.
  
**Notes**
  
** Powers are lesser powers.
Spells that add damage to your attacks have a base damage of 10. Their damage is increased on heavy attacks and is more effective on two-handed weapons than one-handed. The spells do not stack with spells that do the same from my other mods. Only one can be active at the same time. Spells are toggleable.*
  
  
**How to get them**
  
  
A unique sword and a Spell Tome can be found in Halldir's Cairn.
  
They get sold by a new Merchant found in the Moorside Inn in Morthal with the [Dareni's Spells - Merchants](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/109762) addon.
  
Optional SPID file for items can be found from Necromancers.
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
  
Desecration was created to be used together with Mysticism and Adamant, but they are not mandatory.
