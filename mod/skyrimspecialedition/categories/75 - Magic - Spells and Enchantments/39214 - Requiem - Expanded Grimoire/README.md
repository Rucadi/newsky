**Requiem - Expanded Grimoire**

﻿

Requiem - Expanded Grimoire adds two hundred new spells to Requiem - The Roleplaying Overhaul, as well as changing existing spells and the magic perks. It does this by merging other spell mods together, and editing the spells to work with Requiem. Mages in general have also been rebalanced, with far less cost reduction available. All ranked spells have been renamed, so the magic system now feels more unknowable. With about three hundred spells in the Grimoire, no one character can reasonably use or know all spells, so the magic system feels much larger. All spells that previously could only be found in certain places have been merged into leveled lists, to prevent the need for metagaming. Leveling speed has been modded so that each school of magicka levels at the same speed. 
  
  
  
**Balance Changes**
  

  
* Mages in general have been rebalanced.
Half cost perks now decrease costs by less and less as higher perks are taken, from 50% at novice to only 10% at master. This massively nerfs late game mages, roughly doubling their magicka costs. Magic is still overpowered, but far more difficult to use, requiring a specialized build to be a master mage.
  
* An MCM slider has been added if you want magic nerfed further. You can reduce offensive spell magnitude as far as you feel it needs.
Damaging and healing spells now receive a 20% boost in magnitude when you take the next higher level perk. e.g. Firesparks receives a 20% damage boost when apprentice destruction perk is taken. This is so they continue to be viable until the next version of that spell e.g. Fiery Ray is available. Can be toggled of using the MCM.
  
* Fortify Conjuration, Alteration etc. enchantments now don't stack with themselves, although they do with each other. This prevents the player getting spells cost down to 0%.
Fortify Conjuration, Alteration etc. potions now increase magnitude up to 25%, not decrease costs.
  
* All Master Half Cost Spell Perks have been changed to unlock at 90 skill level. This is to bring them in line with Illusion, as well as the Ritual Quests.
The regenerate magicka enchantment has been buffed to match that of College Robes, so you can wear other things for a change.
  
* The free spells you can take when you take a perk have been removed. This can be disabled via the MCM.

  
  
**Elements of Magic**
  
  
Earth, Sun, Poison, Absorb Health, Wind, Soul Trap, Corrosion and Annialation are now fully fleshed out elements of magic, with perk trees and over a dozen spells each. Elements of magic are scaled as below.
