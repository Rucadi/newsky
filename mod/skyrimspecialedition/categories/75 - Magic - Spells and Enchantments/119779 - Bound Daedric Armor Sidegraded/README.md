# Bound Daedric Armor Sidegraded

I wanted a more vanilla experience along with a more traditional style of bound armor spells, but with the fancy new effects skyrim can bring. So, taking inspiration from Leazers Bound Armor for Oldrim I recreated the spells to bring that experience for myself. I hope others can find this mod enjoyable.
  
  
This mod REQUIRES Bound Daedric Armor for their meshes and textures. This mod is meant to overwrite the BoundArmor.esp. This mod modifies the conjuration spell tome leveled lists, and no more atronach forging. If you wear armor underneath the bound armor in a corresponding slot, the armor rating for that piece of armor is reduced to 0 while the bound armor is equipped. You can unequip your bound armor from your inventory screen.
