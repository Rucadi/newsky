〜Immersive Illusion Spells〜

> - In-game skill description for Illusion.

  
  
Illusion always felt very lackluster and not all that exciting when compared to other schools of magic. To make up for this, this mod now adds a bunch of new spells that are actually fun to use, making illusionist playthroughs interesting and more different than ever before.
  
  

  
* **Manipulation of the mind**: The idea is to make illusion let you harness the power of mind manipulation, for beneficial or detrimental effects. Play with their mind, read their thoughts, trick your enemies!
**New Spells**: To make Ilusion more enticing to use, I’ve created 16 additional spells for all tiers that will lead to more interesting gameplay and roleplaying opportunities for illusionists. These spells have some flashy and mind-blowing (ha) effects.
  
  
* **No projectiles:** These Illusion spells do not have magic orb projectiles (like a firebolt that gets shot from your hand with a projectile arc, etc). Instead they are more subtle, sneaky and happen instantaneously. Think of Axii from the Witcher world. Aim at the enemy and cast.
**Where to Find them:** The new spells can be bought from fellow mages or be found in the wild.
  
  
* **Targets:** By default, most of the spells below will only apply to living creatures. With "Master of the Mind", your spells will also affect Undead, Daedra, and Dwarven automatons.

  
  

*Mod Showcase - No, it's not an illusion... or is it?*

  
  
List of Spells:
  
  

  
* **NOVICE**
    
  [list]
**Distraction** - Nearby enemies will think they heard something at the targeted location. (Larger range if dual casted)
  
  

[\*]**APPRENTICE**
  

  
* **Mind Trick** - For 15 seconds, targets feel more inclined to be persuaded or intimidated. (Bigger effect if dual casted, it can also affect prices slightly)
**Insight**: See through the eyes of your target for 15 seconds, revealing resistances and intentions. (30 seconds if dual casted)
  
* **Crawl** - Reduces enemy movement by 25% for 30 seconds. (50% reduced movement if dual casted)
**Blur** - Enemies have a hard time hitting the caster, missing 50% of their physical attacks. (90% if dual casted. This is a concentration spell, so you must actively be casting this - it’s sort of like a ward for physical attacks)
  
  

[\*]**ADEPT**
  

  
* **Tremor** - Targets up to level 15 lose their grip, dropping their weapon to the ground. (Level 30 if dual casted)
**Mirror** - Creates an ethereal illusion of the target, distracting your enemies for 10 seconds.  (20 seconds if dual casted)
  
* **Stumble** - Targets up to level 15 temporarily lose their balance, falling to the ground. (Level 30 if dual casted)
**Masquerade** - Disguise yourself as a humanoid target for 15 seconds. Can be casted on both dead and alive enemies to steal their faces. Entering combat or jumping dispels the illusion. (30 seconds if dual casted)
  
  

[\*]**EXPERT**
  

  
* **Brain Fog** - Drains the target's Magicka by 10 points per second for 10 seconds. (20 seconds if dual casted)
**Weariness** - Drains the target's Stamina by 10 points per second for 10 seconds. (20 seconds if dual casted)
  
* **Mind Thorn** - For 30 seconds, each time the target attacks with a weapon or bow, they take 10 damage. (60 seconds if dual casted)
**Mirage** - Creates 2 ethereal mirror illusions of the caster for 30 seconds. (60 seconds if dual casted)
  
 
[\*]**MASTER**
  

  
* **Mind Fracture** - Creates an illusion of the target for 15 seconds. The target can be hurt by the illusion. (30  seconds if dual casted)
**Delirium** - Humanoid targets up to level 25 are pacified and compelled to dance for 30 seconds within a large radius. (Level 50 if dual casted)
  
* **Mind Control** - Take full control of targets up to level 25 for 30 seconds.(Master Spell - Level 50 if dual casted - You can actually control the body of the target as if you were that character and make them jump off a cliff or make them attack their friends - Just be careful, as your actual body can still be hurt while possessing the target. To cancel, press the jump key)

[/list]
  
  
**NON-ILLUSION CHANGES (OPTIONAL AND DISABLED BY DEFAULT)**
  
These changes are optional and disabled by default. You can enable them by selecting them in the fomod.
  
  

  
* **Blink (Expert Alteration Spell)** - Allows the caster to rapidly traverse mid-sized distances in an instant. (Inspired by the ability in Dishonored - Dual cast to traverse a bigger distance)
**Cure Poison (Adept Restoration Spell)** - Stops the effects of any poisons affecting the caster. (Dual cast to affect nearby NPCs if using the Mysticism addon)
  
* **Throw Voice (AKA: "Hey Skeever-Brain" Shout)** - Since this shout becomes pretty useless with the inclusion of "Distraction", I've modified the original shout so that the second and third word now also blind enemies that are distracted by the sound, making it easier to sneak past them.

**ESL flagged? Safe to install mid-save?**Yes and yes.
  
  
**How are the items distributed in the world? Any conflicts?**The mod is injecting the book tome records into the leveled lists the first time you launch the game, which in layman terms means: No conflicts at all. However, if you are an advanced user and you wish to disable the injection and do your own thing for whatever reason, you can disable the injection using the globals inside the mod.
  
  
**What's the difference between this version and the one you published under the GTS resource page?**Fixed a few small bugs and enhanced compatibility for this new version. The old one will be hidden. The non illusion spells are now optional.
  
  
**I was using the old version. Can I upgrade to this one mid-save?**Yes.
  
  
**Why did you upload the mod in your resource page first instead of making a mod page for it?**
  
Making and maintaining a mod page takes time. Time is a finite resource I try to invest wisely. Or as wisely as possible for someone making mods for a 13 year old game.
  
  
**How do the NPCs react to the illusion spells in your video?**The mod pairs well with "[NPCs React to Frenzy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/107492)", by SayJerpa, my archnemesis.
  
  
**Other mods have done these spells before!**Well, good! This is my take on them. Variety is the spice of life. 
  
  
**You haven't streamed or published mods in a while. Are you alive?**I've been busy working on the next update of Gate to Sovngarde. 3 months of work... Barely any sleep... Already 50 freaking A4 pages of changes... It's going to kick ass!
  
  
**Is this compatible with X?**Probably! Magic overhauls should be compatible, but some spells might be similar to these ones.
