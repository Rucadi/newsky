There are two types of rare spells. Some are rare because they're closely guarded screts only the most powerful of mages could unlock. Others are rare because no one bothered to learn them.
  
  
This mods adds 11 "rare" spells in the later catagory. There is only a single tome of each of them in Skyrim. But that doesn't mean they're good. Though some are defiantly more useless then others. I'll add more spells later.
