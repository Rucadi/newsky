# Colorful Magic (Bosses)
- Author: Sethiroth
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/125049


DESCRIPTION

  
  
I have ported 46 of the bosses from the LE version of Colorful Magic, into Skyrim SE. Each boss and their loot has been tested in my personal load order without any CTDs. A few of the enchantments aren't working, but we can tackle those later, once I'm sure the bosses are as stable and as compatible as possible.
  
  
This mod does NOT contain vendors, as that service is covered in my other mod, "Vendors for Colorful Magic (Fixed)". 
  
  
There is an optional plugin for this mod, "Colorful Magic (Bosses) - Passive" which makes most of these bosses unaggressive. This file will allow you to walk right passed these bosses during your early game without getting attacked. I'm looking at you, Forest Guardian! Please note, they will still protect themselves if provoked. Don't poke these bears until you're sure you can take them on! This plugin is an ESL flagged ESP file. You're welcome.
  
  
I've also uploaded a separate mod, "Colorful Magic (Bosses) - MCM", which allows the player to disable / enable any of these bosses at will. This is a great way to circumvent any bugs or conflicts which come up in your load order. If a boss crashes your game, you can report the bug, disable that particular boss, and continue on enjoying the rest of the bosses. No need to avoid an entire area because of a buggy boss or restart your game to tweak your load order. Just disable the buggy boss and keep on playing :)
  
  
Unfortunately, this mod will take up an ESP slot, but the optional file(s) and MCM related to it will be ESL-Flagged ESP files. Best I could do.
  
Please consult the F.A.Q. section below, before asking any questions in the POSTS section.
  
  

INSTALLATION GUIDE

  
Install through any typical mod manager. Make sure to load this mod above "Colorful Magic (Fixed)", so those changes can still do their thing. Mithras666 saved me a LOT of time and effort with that mod. 
  
  

LOAD ORDER

  
The optimal load order for these colorful magic mods are as follows:
  
1) "Colorful Magic (Bosses)"
  
2) "Colorful Magic Spells (Fixed)"
  
3) "Vendors for Colorful Magic Spells (Fixed)"
  
4) "Colorful Magic (Bosses) - MCM (Optional)"
  
5) "Colorful Magic (Bosses) - Passive Patch (Optional)"
  
  

CURRENT BOSS LOCATIONS

  
Each of these bosses and their loot was successfully tested on my 600+ mod load order without a CTD. They are intended for the end game stage of your playthrough. Their loot, however, is also end game level in power. Be cautious :)

DISABLED BOSSES

  
  
The following bosses are disabled because of their notorious risk of CTDs. I will work on salvaging these bosses later, once I'm sure the others are working smoothly:
  
 ﻿- Ghost of Blades
  
 ﻿- Loki
  
 ﻿- Meteor Dragon
  
 ﻿- Snow Ghost
  
  

F.A.Q.

  
  
Q - "Are these disabled bosses gone forever?"
  
A - "Nope, once I'm confident these bosses, their loot and the vendors are working smoothly, I'll return to fix and enable these bosses."
  
  
Q - "I installed this mod, but a bunch of the spells and boss attacks have weird green shapes attached to them."
  
A - "That's because you didn't load "Colorful Magic (Fixes)" right after this mod. Those fixes are absolutely necessary."
  
  
Q - "This (boss-spell-weapon) isn't exactly like it was in the original mod."
  
A - "True. In order to clean up some of these bugs, we were forced to remove some spells / items / attacks. In time I'll look into re-implementing some of them, once I'm sure our currently deployment is working well."
  
  
Q - "None of these Colorful Magic mods you've shown in the load order above have the shouts or crafting elements from the original mod."
  
A - "Correct, we're updating and fixing Colorful Magic in modular increments. My next task is to give my vendors their own interior cell, so they can show off all their wares without conflicting with every Whiterun Overhaul on the Nexus. From there, I'll work on Crafting and the shouts."
