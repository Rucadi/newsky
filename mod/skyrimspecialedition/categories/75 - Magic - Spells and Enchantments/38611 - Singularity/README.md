Singularity - Power: Compress space into volatile matter that slows, staggers, and deals massive Fire damage (+small Shock damage and irresistible damage) to targets in the vicinity.
  
  
You will get the power after defeating Alduin (in Sovngarde)
  
Spell tome and scrolls can be obtained with console/additemmenu. Even though spell is technically an Alteration spell, it is located in Destruction category.
  
This is also another one of my unfinished concepts(Back when I was making The Final Cataclysm) getting a separate release.
