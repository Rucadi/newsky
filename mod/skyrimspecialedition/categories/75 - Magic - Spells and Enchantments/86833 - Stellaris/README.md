Spoiler

**Notes**
  
** Powers are lesser powers.
Spells that add damage to your attacks have a base damage of 10. Their damage is increased on heavy attacks and is more effective on two-handed weapons than one-handed. The spells do not stack with spells that do the same from my other mods. Only one can be active at the same time. Spells are toggleable.*
  
  
**How to get them**
  
  
They get sold by a new Merchant found in the Temple of Mara with the [Dareni's Spells - Merchants](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/109762) addon.
  
Optional SPID file for items can be found from Khajiits.
  
  
**Requirements:**
  
  
[Scrambled Bugs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43532)﻿ enable: Perk Entry Points: Apply Multiple Spells
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
  
Stellaris was created to be used together with Mysticism and Adamant, but they are not mandatory.
  
SPID file included to enable certain spells for npcs. It does not distribute spells and is not required when the spells are not added to npcs.
