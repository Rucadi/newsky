# Necromantic Grimoire - Mysticism Rebalance
- Author: MichaelDawn

This mod is an overhaul of the Necromantic Grimoire Creation to make it compatible with [Mysticism - A Magic Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839) and the rest of [SimonMagus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/67410746)' overhauls. Similar to my [Arcane Accessories Rebalance Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61559), care is taken to try to preserve any unique visuals or ideas that don't clash directly with Mysticism or its sister mods, but some features are cut in the interest of balance and consistency. Unlike my Arcane Accessories Rebalance, this mod only has a Mysticism version, with no vanilla alternative. Mysticism 2.0 introduced a fairly consistent progression for summon spells that is completely absent in vanilla Skyrim. This made it much easier to determine how to fit these spells into it's ecosystem compared to vanilla. 
  
  
**General Changes:**
  

  
* *Base stats, weapons, spells, and perks of all summons are rebalanced based on their rank and class according to the closest Mysticism equivalents.*
*All summon spells have the standard 60-second duration set by Mysticism*
  
* *Aside from Soul Split, any spells or effects that provide multiple summons or allow summons to summon additional summons have been summarily removed to preserve the summon limit balance intended by Adamant, Aetherius, and SimonMagus' other overhauls.*
*All summons benefit from Conjuration perks that affect "summoned creatures".*
  
* *NG summons no longer benefit from the vanilla Dark Souls perk. The Soul Cairn summons added in Dawnguard were not affected by this perk, so it was weird they did that in NG.*
*Some spells have been removed from distribution due to conflicting with Mysticism spells, but I've preserved most of them and reworked them to fit within Mysticism's spell list*
  
* *Most of the new NG spell tomes are only available as static loot from necromancer dungeons, like they were in the original creation. This makes them unique rewards for conquering those dungeons rather than just more clutter in vendor inventories.*
*The Necromancer Robes added by NG have been renamed to "Revenant Robes", given a unique tiered enchantment that gives higher magicka and magicka regen than standard robes at the cost of health and health regen (like the Necromancer's Amulet). An optional file is available to tweak these values for use with [Thaumaturgy - An Enchanting Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57138)﻿.*
  
* *These robes are distributed to all leveled Necromancer Boss enemies, as well as a couple named Necromancers (see details below).*

  
**Spell Changelog:**
  
Spoiler
  

  
* **Conjure Skeleton Minion** - Removed in favor of Mysticism's Skeletons
**Conjure Skeleton Marksman** - Removed in favor of Mysticism's Skeletons
  
* **Conjure Skeleton Champion** - Removed in favor of Mysticism's Skeletons
**Conjure Skeleton Warlock** - Removed in favor of Mysticism's Skeletons
  
* **Conjure Bone Colossus** - Replaces Mysticism's Skeleton Champion, rebalanced to same stats

  

  
* **Conjure Undying Ghost** - Now requires a full magicka bar to cast.
**Conjure Haunting Spirit -> Conjure Haunting Ghost** - Replaced Haunting Curse effect with Frost Explosion, similar to Flaming Familiar or Mysticism's Dwarven Spider. Adept Rank. 
  
* **Conjure Tomb Guardian -> Conjure Haunted Headsman** - Removed shade summon effect. Now deals frost damage with axe and deals bonus damage to enemies below half health. Expert Rank.
**Conjure Cursed Spectre -> Conjure Wraith** - Renamed based on internal references to Oblivion wraiths. Removed poison cloak, still attacks with an Absorb Health and Magicka spell. Expert Rank
  
* **Conjure Ancient Deathpriest -> Conjure Gloom Wraith** - Master-rank version of Conjure Wraith. Converted to unused visuals that look more similar to the Cursed Spectre/Wraith. Now uses a strong Absorb Health and Magicka spell. Staff and other spells removed.

  

  
* **Banish Undead** - Removed. Conflicts design-wise with the many Sun Damage and Turn Undead spells added by Mysticism and supported by Adamant perks.
**Necromancer's Ritual** - Absorbs 10 Health per second from friendly summoned or reanimated minions. Allows you to use your summons as a cheap source of Health or, with the use of Equilibrium, Magicka. Mysticism summons are a good bit tougher than vanilla Skyrim, so relying on summons dying for restoration is inefficient. The new spell is intended to provide a more active playstyle, and scales well with multiple summons. *(subject to tweaking)*
  
* **Soul Split** - Rebalanced spell cost and summon stats for Mysticism. Fixed so that it only allows you to summon one extra over your standard summon limit, rather than getting BOTH shades without using a summon slot.

  
  
**Spell Tome Locations:**
  
Spoiler
  

  
* **Conjure Wraith** - Available to purchase with other Expert Conjuration spells
**Conjure Gloom Wraith** - Available to purchase after Conjuration Ritual quest
  
* **Conjure Bone Colossus** - Available to purchase after Conjuration Ritual quest, replaces Skeleton Champion

  

  
* **Conjure Undying Ghost** - Hillgrund's Tomb (moved from Ritual Stone, too easy to get to)

* **Conjure Haunted Headsman** - Rannveig's Fast
**Necromancer's Ritual** - Wolf Skull Cave (unchanged)
  
* **Soul Split** - Ilinalta's Deep (unchanged)

  
  
**Necromancer's Robes:**
  
Necromantic Grimoire added two new sets of robes and hoods for necromancer enemies. However, most of the enchanted variants added simply use the generic "Fortify Magicka Regeneration" effect found on half the other mage robes in the game. The two highest-level variants had unique enchantments, but were locked behind a 50% chance to spawn on the highest-level necromancer enemies. In addition, these high-level variants also increase your summon limit, which has significant effects on Mysticism's balance.
  
  
Instead, I have reworked all of these robes based on the vanilla Necromancer's Amulet. The hoods and robes are now renamed to "Revenant Hood/Robes" and provide bonus Magicka (hoods) or Magicka Regen (robes) per tier at the cost of Health or Health Regen, respectively. 
  
  
An optional file is available for those using Thaumaturgy or another enchanting overhaul that reduces the triple-digit Magicka Regen values of vanilla mage robes.
  
  
**NPC Changes:**The new Revenant Robes are distributed to all leveled Necromancer boss enemies, as well as some named Necromancer bosses like Arondil and the Ritual Master.
  
Spells are no longer distributed to generic necromancers, in favor of letting necromancer enemies use their reanimation spells instead. Many necromancer encounters include dead bodies for this purpose, and IMO it feels more necromantic that way.
  
  
**Compatibility:**Changes from the Unofficial Creation Club Content Patch are already forwarded, so the patch should not be used with this mod.
  
  
NPC changes are made "manually" in the .esp and may require a merged or bashed patch if using an enemy or NPC overhaul that affects those particular NPCs. I'm trying to get the outfit changes to work with the latest version of SPID, but it appears SPID still has some issues with leveled NPCs. Will have a SPID version once I can figure that out.
