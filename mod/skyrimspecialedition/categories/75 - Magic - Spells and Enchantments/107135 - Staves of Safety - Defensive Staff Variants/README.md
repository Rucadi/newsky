Description
  
  
Remember Gandalf fighting the Balrog in LoTR? If you want to play that in Skyrim, this mod is for you!
  
Spoiler
  
This mod adds new staves to match the defensive spells in Skyrim. So far, it covers:
  
  

  
* Ward spells - Lesser Ward, Steadfast Ward, Greater Ward
Healing spells - Healing, Fast Healing, Close Wounds, Grand Healing
  
* Armor spells - Oakflesh, Stoneflesh, Ironflesh, Ebonyflesh

  
All new staves can be crafted at Staff Enchanters (like the one in Solstheim) with the usual Heart Stone recipes.
  
  
These new staves are also added to the appropriate leveled lists. If you have other mods that add new staves, a bashed patch is recommended.
  
  
  
Requirements & Compatibility
  
  
All mods in the Requirements section are optional!
  
  
Compatible with **all Skyrim SE/AE versions**. Flagged as **ESP-FE** for your modding pleasure.
  
  
**Highly recommended** - Use either one of [Staves On Self Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89075) or [Self-targeting Staff Animation Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92993) to enable support for self-targeted staves. Otherwise the new staves will look glitchy and weird.
  
  
Additional patches are provided to add support for spells from other mods:
  
  
Mysticism
  
This patch adds new staves for the spells in [Mysticism - A Magic Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839) by SimonMagus. Magic effects and values are updated to match the changes from Mysticism. Additional staves include:
  
  

  
* Ward spells - Grand Ward, Spelldrinker
Healing spells - Greater Healing, Mara's Embrace, Close Greater Wounds, Breath of Life, Stendarr's Mercy
  
* Armor spells - Dragonhide

Note: These staves currently don't benefit from Adamant perks. I'll make an Adamant/H2H patch in the near future.
  
  
Sorcerer
  
This patch adds support for crafting the new staves using [Sorcerer - A Staff and Scroll Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/95196) by SimonMagus.
  
  
Skyrim Unbound Reborn
  
This patch adds the new staves to the starting options when using [Skyrim Unbound Reborn (Alternate Start)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27962) by lilebonymace.
