This mod simply makes it so that the Slow time shout will not slow the player down. The way this is implemented ensures that this will not mess up other enemies that use time manipulation spells (and edit the player game speed through a hidden perk) from other mods.
  
Slow Time shout magnitude has also been adjusted to match the new player speed.
  
  
Penguin wants a new mod so I had to upload something!
