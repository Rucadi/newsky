**Ever wanted to use that spell Festus Krex talks about at the beginning of the dark brotherhood quest?**

  
**[b]Festus Krex**[/b]:  *"Ah, the young and stupid. Always mocking the experienced and brilliant. My contract went very well, I'll have you know. Tried a new spell. Little something I've been working on in my spare time. Came "this" close to turning that priest inside out. Damned messy."*
  
  
  
When I first played Skyrim going through the dark brotherhood quest, I wondered if that spell was real in the game, alas, it is not. Now that just won't do it for me. [I did something about it back on LE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59818?tab=description)  (Would not recommend this version)
  
  
  

***SOMETHING*** had to be done about this wonderful piece of lore and bring it to **LIFE!**
  
 Introducing the

A powerful master level destruction spell that will displace your poor victims bones beside themselves. Yes. You heard that right. You can literally put some poor fool beside themselves. Neat, *lootable* pile of naked bones and chunks.
  
  
***....Does this change the game rating?***
  
  
With me getting back into making mods for Skyrim™, I decided to not just do a simple port of this mod from LE to SSE. I already saw that someone did, and I didn't even know about it until I started filling out the mod details. Oh well, either way, that version is *inferior* now because I've made some changes and improved everything from textures, meshes, particles, as well as the function of the spell.

It looks better, functions better, and it is no longer automatically added into your inventory, it now has a spell tome that can be found at the Sanctuary next to Falkreath, next to the bed Festus sleeps on, on top of the chest next to it. HARD to miss.

This spell now comes with it's own custom spell tome, textures to the chunks and bones have been improved, added an additional custom effect to the left over bones from the unfortunate victim, and reworked the projectile, cast body effect, and ALL without the "permanent" red glow goof I made with the original. Essential NPC's, Animal's, & creatures wont get turned inside out, however it will put them into a bleed out state.
  
  
Magicka cost is roughly the same as master level spells such as "Firestorm" (1400ish), after all, it IS a master level spell. When play testing, I used [Vokrii](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26176) & maxed out destruction, allotted most points to Magicka & the cost comes down to 400ish Magicka ***BEFORE*** enchantments. With the right enchantments, you could get to a point that you can almost spam the spell, but you have to *work for it.*
