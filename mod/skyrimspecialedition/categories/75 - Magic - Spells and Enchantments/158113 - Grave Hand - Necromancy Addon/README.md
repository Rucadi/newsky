Behold, new necromantic power from beyond the grave!

  
  
Grave Hand - Necromancy Addon provides a new spell called Grave Hand, which sends forth a chill hand to siphon life from the target and transfer it to the caster.
  
  
The new spell is also available via a custom staff, representing a foul necromantic fusion of flesh, metal, and wood.
  
  
Both the spell tome and the staff can be found at **Falkreath Watchtower**, but beware! Whilst the resident necromancer has left their research notes downstairs, the staff remains close at hand, and they might just use it against you should you invade their lair...
  
  
An optional [Spell Perk Item Distributor (SPID)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869) distribution file is available. Optional integration for [Grave Digging - Necromancy Addon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/129204) is provided so you can craft the staff using exhumed remains.
  
  
The ESP is flagged as ESL. Grave Hand was created using an updated Creation Kit which produced an ESP with file header version 1.71, so [Backported Extended ESL Support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441) may be needed for older game versions older than 1.6.1130.
