Most users were having issues with crashes when casting certain spells, so what I did was:
  
  

  
* Forwarded some USSEP changes
Removed "Ageless Insight" spell from all leveled lists, deleted relevant magic effects and spell tome
  
* Deleted unused spell Dream's Grip
Fixed "Unresolved FormID" with a certain Ritual Hazard spell that referenced the wrong MGEF
  
* Audio issues with Lightning Bolt and Fire Bolt mentioned by some users should be fixed
Removed buggy "Conjure Putrid Imp" spell because the imp doesn't actually fight
  
* Fixed "Distortion Flux"  not having a proper description
Changed Crystallize Soul to have a flat 50% chance to trigger "Spawn Empty Soul Gem" instead of 5%, increased magicka cost significantly to compensate.

Here is a better version of the original mod's description: ***Years in the making, Arcanum is a massive spell mod that aims to combine unique gameplay with visual effects of a quality never attempted before in Skyrim. With 200 spells complete, 300+ spells planned, and inspired by everything from Dragon's Dogma to Planescape, Arcanum may be the most ambitious magic mod ever made.***
  
**Destruction**
  
  
When designing the destruction spells, I split the school into three distinct styles along the elements. Each has a different playstyle, strengths, weaknesses, and players may choose either to focus and go all in on one element, or use the others to help mitigate their element's weaknesses. All playstyles will be rewarded with unique combos and payoffs. 
  
  
> * Fire
>
> Fire spells in Arcanum are meant to be spammed. They have short cast times, high damage, and reasonable magicka costs. Many spells, like *Blazing Soul*, were specifically designed to reward the player for casting as many spells as quickly as possible. Fire spells tend to be the most straightforward playstyles of the bunch, but that doesn't mean there's no nuance. For example, fire has a slight healing theme, with spells like *Radiant Helix* and *Cauterize*. It's a good way to survive, but when you add *Punishing Fire* into the mix, all of a sudden these healing spells become absurd sources of damage.

>   
> * Frost
>
>   
> Frost magic has traditionally gotten the short end of the stick. Stamina drain isn't very useful, and most enemies in Skyrim are Nords, with natural frost resistance. Frost in Arcanum is focused on area control and debuffs. Cover the ground with cheap spells like *Icy Vortex* and *Gelid Gale*, slowing enemies and reducing their resistances. Weaken them with *Crippling Chill* and*Icy Cannonade*. Finish them with *Frozen Maelstrom* and *Crystal Spear*, difficult to aim spells that take advantage of slow, weakened enemies. 
>

>   
> * Shock
>
>   
> Shock magic has the ability to deal unmitigated percent health damage, which the other elements cannot. Shock spells also have various unique utilities, the ability to boost power at the cost of health, and spells that can trigger one another in loops. In exchange, however, shock spells cost more magicka, and lack as many good area of effect options as Fire and Frost. However, it does have access to one of the best enablers for other area spells in *Twisting Tempest*.

  
  
*Combine Fire and Frost, and hold them in place with Gelid Gales while hitting them with fireballs.*
  
*Combine Frost and Shock, and use frost's ability to reduce resistances to further increase shock damage.*
  
*Combine Fire and Shock, and use fire's healing to offset shock's health loss while hitting them with giant balls of fire and lightning*
  
  
  
**Restoration**
  
  
How many spell mods have had restoration spells as just a bunch of uninventive heals and plague spells? Arcanum's take on restoration is different. You won't find any overpowered "Fast Healings" in here. God knows there's enough out there - and the vanilla spells aren't bad for healing yourself. No, Restoration in Arcanum takes a different approach. Turn your allies into gods as a battle cleric, protect the weak by sacrificing your own life, or become a dark doctor that turns healing itself into harm. To help guide my design, I divided Restoration into three sub-categories
  
  
> ﻿
>
>   
> * Regeneration
>
>   
> My take on generic healing is instead all about the manipulation of your life force. Spells like *Martyrdom* and *Transfusion* ask you to give up your life for bonus effects, while Spells like *Avenging Blaze* and*Vital Surge* have bonus effects when the caster is at low health. Your health itself is as much a resource as magicka. How low are you willing to go? Are you confident you can survive to amp up your damage? Are you willing to hurt yourself to help your allies? 
>   
>   
>
>   
> * Reinforcement
>
>   
> It's not about strengthening yourself, the art of restoration is bolstering your allies and functioning as a team. Whether that's putting buffs like *Daybreak Coronet*and *Guardian Shield*on allies, turning them into unstoppable crusaders, or with spells like *Unbreakable Formation*and *Aedric Wind*, which reward you for sticking close to your friends and dishing out the pain together. Some of these spells can be a little tricky. Is *Detention Sphere*a tool to save your allies, or a way to control your enemies? You decide.
>   
>   
>
>   
> * Malfeasance
>
>   
> But through your careful study of healing magics, you've come to learn just how fragile life really is. And now you can turn that to your advantage. Malfeasance is a collection of spells that twist the meaning of healing. That pervert the idea of restoration, and have both offensive and defensive applications. Pretend you're their friend through *Torrid Therapy*and *False Promise*, then make them pay for their ignorance with *Malpractice*and *Mortify.* Give them hope, then laugh while you steal their life away through *Abrogate*. Unleash devastating diseases that can single-handedly collapse entire armies.

  
  
Illusion
  
  
Illusion always gets the short end of the stick in Vanilla, doesn't it? Fear, Frenzy, and Calm spells simply don't scale all that well, do very little against bosses or dragons or difficult enemies, and it's almost always something you ignore, or take for the occasional utility. Spell mods like Apocalypse go out of their way to ignore vanilla mechanics, and perk mods like Ordinator turn it into a mishmash of random stuff. I say, no more. There's real potential in Illusion. Arcanum gives renewed purpose to vanilla illusion spells with special synergies, and really lets you fulfill that fantasy of playing as a deadly, deceitful, mind mage. There's also plenty of spells that support spellthief, spellsword, and even magicka archer playstyles, and some mage characters might even find it more useful to spec into illusion than restoration, since it provides a lot of support functions and a teeny amount of healing.
  
  
> ﻿
>
>   
> * Psychosis
>
>   
> These are spells that play with Vanilla mechanics of fear, frenzy, and calm. Spells like*Mental Vapors* and*Psychosomatic Manifestation*give strong early-game payoffs for applying influence spells to enemies, while *Grisly Spectacle, Fervid Visions,*and *Unbroken Focus* let you affect enemies that are stronger than you and break the game's caps of Illusion level. This section also includes powerful debuffs like *Hymn of Anguish* that further augment the playstyle, and *Ceaseless Torment*is scarily effective if you can manage to frenzy enemies.

> * Mentalism
>
>   
> Illusion, as a school, might lack the raw power of Destruction and Conjuration, but being master of the mind has its perks. You're unparalleled when it comes to fighting other mages, counteracting their spells while augmenting your own. Early on, spells like *Spell Pierce* and *Damping Matrix* can really hamper opposing spellcasters, while *Ignite Memories* makes short work of anyone trying to cast their own spells. Later on, you can use your massive brain to spark fireworks. Spells like *Clash of Wills, Overwhelming Intellect,*and *Spark of the Master*flaunt your intelligence in the form of devastating, magicka-based damage.

>   
> * Deception
>
>   
> But pride goeth before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall. Why fight out in the open when you remain hidden, and strike when the enemy's guard is down? Deception is all about incapacitating the target, and attacking from the unseen. Spells like *Attrition* and *Shroud of Shadow*bolster an assassin's arsenal, even at low levels of Illusion, While *Delusive Smokescreen*and *Flash Step* let you jump in and out of invisibility mid-combat. If you prefer to strike from afar, *Spellshot Repeater* and *Spotter's Strix* test your accuracy, and reward skilled snipers with chunky headshot damage.

  
Conjuration
  
  
With the conjuration update, I aimed to tackle a few features I thought were really bad about Conjuration in the base game, and in a lot of other mods I saw. Necromancy is historically underpowered, summons are quite boring and tend to involve little to no activity from the player, and bound weapons and soul trapping seem isolated in their own corner, without anything linking them to the rest of the school. With a bevy of powerful summons in the base game AND other mods, instead, Arcanum Conjuration aims to offer more utility and incentivizes the player not to hide in a corner while their summon does the work.
  
  
> * Atromancy
>
>   
> These are the summons, unique summons with unique abilities. I think the core idea going in for me was to make these summons situationally powerful, or very powerful only in certain spots, or with great costs. They encourage players to play around them and build around them. *Conjure Putrid Imp*summons a weak imp that increases the damage you deal to a target. *Death's shadow* gets stronger the lower health you have, and prevents you from healing altogether. *Soulforge Sculptor*copies your right-hand weapon, and beats your enemies in concert with you. *Howlpack Alpha* summons a wolf for every nearby enemy when you conjure it, allowing you to instantly turn the tides of a fight. Then there are a multitude of spells that allow you to enhance or manipulate your summons, using them in more strategic ways. *Oblivion Rift* teleports your summons back to you, providing much needed utility. *Ritualist's Circle* allows you to inscribe a magic glyph into the earth, enhancing your summons within. Finally, the most experienced of Atromancers might find themselves with the power to meld two generic elemental atronachs into something much much more, or open a portal to Oblivion itself and watch the chaos ensue.
>   
>   
>
>   
> * Necromancy
>
>   
> Necromancy has always been traditionally underpowered, so I sought out more ways to reward players for going through the arduous task of finding available dead bodies. Arcanum provides a slew of ways to empower your zombies, making them far more damaging than daedric summons. *Essence Extraction* allows you to transfer the Racial powers of one corpse to a zombie. *Vigor Mortis* heals and empowers an undead unit at the cost of your own health, and *Army of Darkness* can exponentially increase the size of your undead horde.

> I wanted to create more creative options for bound weapons, so this was perhaps the most experimental school. *Bound Tomahawk* creates a one handed bound axe that can be thrown as a ranged weapon. *Kynreeve Swordstorm* summons sentient bound swords that strike down enemies around you. *Bound Demonblade*grants you both a dashing attack and massive magical damage, at the cost of your own health - it cannot be sheathed until it has tasted blood. Finally, with full control over the vast armory of bound weapons, why even bother to wield them when you can hurl them at your enemies as projectiles?
