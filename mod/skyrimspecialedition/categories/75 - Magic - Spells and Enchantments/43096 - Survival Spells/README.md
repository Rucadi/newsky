*"As a mage, your greatest adversary is Skyrim itself. Unrelenting cold, harsh wilderness, famine and fatigue - do you have the strength to endure?"*
  
  
**This mod requires the Survival Mode Creation Club add-on.** 
  
  
Survival Spells add two new spells to help you survive the cold of Skyrim when using the Survival Mode Creation Club add-on. Fortify Warmth is an Alteration spell providing the protection of warmth to the caster. Restore Cold is a Restoration spell that removes cold damage from the caster. Both are apprentice level spells. General Alteration and Restoration perks, including dual casting, will apply.
  
  
Together these two spells are the rough equivalent of eating a bowl of hot soup. The fire salts ingredient for hot soups is rare, so these spells provide a convenient alternative for mages who are using the Survival Mode add-on.
  
  
The spells can be purchased from any merchant selling apprentice level Alteration or Restoration spells.
  
  
**Notes**
  
    \* Restore Cold provides no Restoration experience. This is a side effect of Survival Mode.
