Improvements to vanilla enchantments
  
  
Summermyst includes several improvements and bugfixes to vanilla enchantments. Here is a short list:
  
  

  
* The "Restoration Loop" has been fixed: Fortify Restoration no longer buffs enchantments.[/\*]
Descriptions and names have been fixed where necessary.[/\*]
  
* Inventory images have been fixed.[/\*]
Weapon enchantments are now properly animated.[/\*]
  
* Names and descriptions have been standardised to match the rest of the game.[/\*]
Disenchanting Drainspell Bow no longer grants a duplicate Absorb Magicka enchantment.[/\*]
  
* Disenchanting Drainheart Sword no longer grants a duplicate Absorb Stamina enchantment.[/\*]
Disenchanting Shield of Solitude no longer grants a duplicate Resist Magic enchantment.[/\*]
  
* Articulation no longer raises your skill level, but is a percentage bonus to speechcraft effectiveness as per the description.[/\*]
Articulation is no longer erroneously keyworded as a Fortify Sneak effect.[/\*]
  
* Fear missing keywords fixed to correctly identify this as a mind affecting fear effect.[/\*]
Fear no longer erroneously has Turn Undead visuals.[/\*]
  
* The spell school and regeneration combo enchantments for robes (Fortify School & Magicka Regen) have been removed from the game; disenchanting a robe now yields the regular Fortify School enchantment, which is more effective because enchantments with more than one effect do not scale as intended.[/\*]
Fortify [Light/Heavy] Armor now increases the armor rating of equipped armor pieces instead of giving skill levels, bringing this enchantment in line with every other Fortify [Skill] enchantment.[/\*]
  
* Fortify One-Handed now correctly affects daggers.[/\*]
Fortify Unarmed Damage is no longer erroneously considered an Alteration effect.[/\*]
  
* Fortify Unarmed Damage now uses a different magic effect because the original was used by Werewolf claws and various NPC creatures. This keeps the enchantment safe from other mods.[/\*]
Frost Damage slow now kicks in (and wears off) when it should and not just when the target performs a different animation, making it much more effective. To compensate, the slow no longer scales with enchantment power and no longer stacks with itself. The same fix has been propagated to frost spell slows and slowing elixirs.[/\*]
  
* Resist Magic is no longer affected by alchemy bonuses instead of enchanting bonuses.[/\*]
Stamina Damage is no longer erroneously considered a fire attack.[/\*]
  
* ...[/\*]

  
The following improvements were made to preset enchantments:
  
  

  
* Briarheart Geis: Fixed a condition bug that made this enchantment not work against any targets; Magicka cost is no longer 0; The enchantment now counts as non-elemental damage; Changed damage type to untyped.[/\*]
Huntsman's Prowess The enchantment now counts as non-elemental damage; Changed damage type to untyped (it was set to a broken version of physical damage that treats armor as resistance, meaning the enchantment deals 0 damage against targets with 100 or more armor).[/\*]
  
* Keening's Sting: Now has a realistic charge cost instead of 1; The weapon Keening was fixed so it has an actual charge level instead of 0, which caused the enchantment to stop working after one hit and then not allow recharging.[/\*]
Notched Pickaxe: The Smithing skill bonus now works; The Smithing skill bonus is no longer affected by Alteration elixirs.[/\*]
  
* Shadowthrive, Shadowsight, Shadowstrike, Shadowstrength: Enchantments can now be applied to custom items.[/\*]
Silent Moons Enchant: Now actually works.[/\*]
  

  
An optional patch is available on the download page to revert Fortify Skill enchantments to their old powerful self and bring back the Restoration Loop.
  
  
FAQ
  
  
Compatibility notes
  
  
See [here](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/116/?) for a list of (in)compatible mods.
  
  
Troubleshooting
  
  
[\*]**Can I upgrade from Summermyst 3.x to 4.x:** Possibly. The mods are very different under the hood due to necessary reworks to support an alchemy overhaul and integrate with Futhark. In many cases an upgrade will be possible, but you should unequip all items first and keep a backup.[/\*]
  
[\*]**Does this mod need a reproccer or patcher:** No. While Wintermyst had a reproccer, 95% of those who used it didn't need it but were confused and thought they did, and the results were not very good anyway.[/\*]
  
[\*]**Some enchantments are much stronger than listed**/**An immortal Wraith King appears at my side even with no relevant items equipped:** Summermyst repurposes a large number of unused actor values (AVs) to implement scaling enchantments: many enchantments modify an unused AV, which is then read by a hidden perk or script. If some of these unused AVs are also used by another mod in your load order, Summermyst will accordingly grant you their effects. This is a compatibility conflict and you may want to not use the affected enchantments or uninstall one or the other mod. The Readme contains a list of all unused actor values.[/\*]
  
[\*]**Does this mod replace the spell cost reduction enchantments with spell effectiveness enchantments:** Summermyst includes both spell cost reduction enchantments ("Fortify <School>") *and* spell effectiveness enchantments ("Amplify <School>").[/\*]
  
[\*]**Some armor enchantments do not work for followers or other NPCs:** This is unfortunately inevitable, but also applies to the vanilla game where almost none of the Fortify <Skill> enchantments work for NPCs. Any armor enchantment that does not increase an actor value (such as "speed" or "health") or affect targets within a radius of the wearer will not work when worn by NPCs, but almost all weapon enchantments will work when wielded by NPCs. Other enchantment overhauls as well as the vanilla game have the same issue.[/\*]
  
[\*]**Everyone resists my weapon enchantment:** As in the vanilla game (Paralyze enchantment), chance or condition based enchantments such as Steal Weapons will display a resist message if the dice roll or condition is not met. This is not a bug.[/\*]
