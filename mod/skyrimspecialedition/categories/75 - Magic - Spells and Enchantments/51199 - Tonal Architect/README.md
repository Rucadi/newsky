[font=bebas\_neuebook]Features[/font]
  
  

  
* Tonal Architect adds Dwemer themed spells to the game, which are built instead of bought.[/\*]
Strong Dwemer theme revolving around devices and makeshift staves with custom models.[/\*]
  
* Follows the "three schools per class, 15 spells per class" style of [Triumvirate](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39170).[/\*]

  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]The tonal architect[/font]
  
  
*The Tonal Architect builds devices and automatons like the Dwemer in whose footsteps he walks.*
  
  
Tonal Architects have little in the way of direct damage, but have an array of disabling and offensive devices. Their attacks take the form of traps and the makeshift staves they build via the Manufacture spell. They can also build automatons, which they can upgrade with weapon charge. Several of their spells require Scrap (the various dwemer clutter items such as Decorative Struts and Cogs) to cast.
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Destruction[/font]
  
  

  
* *(Novice)* **Scald**: A brief steam release for **10** fire damage per second. Automatons gain **100**% speed for **10** seconds.[/\*]
*(Apprentice)* **Arc Mine**: Mine that casts lightning arcs at random targets for **15** shock damage to Health and Magicka.[/\*]
  
* *(Adept)* **Compression Blast**: Releases steam around the caster for **40** fire damage. Automatons gain **100**% speed for **10** seconds.[/\*]
*(Expert)* **Piston Mine**: Mine that ejects incendiary projectiles upwards for **100** fire damage. Targets on fire take extra damage.[/\*]
  
* *(Master)* **Radio Bomb**: Spend **Scrap** to place a remote change and equip a detonator. Using more **Scrap** increases its power.[/\*]

  
Mines have unlimited duration, but self destruct when the caster leaves their immediate area. They attack indiscriminately, but deal no damage to the caster. An upgrade exists to make them buff the caster instead.

The Supercharger upgrade also improves the gun damage of your teammates within range of the bongo and recharges your Tesla faster.
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]How to get the spells[/font]
  
  
The spells are built out of dwemer resources at any Forge.
  
  
Novice spells are available from the start of the game, but higher level spells only become available when your skill level in the school reaches 25, 50, 75 or 100. Master spells additionally require completion of the Dwarven Research quest that is started by using the spells.
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Installation[/font]
  
  
This mod can be installed during a playthrough.
  
  
Note that there need to be 3 uncleared dwemer dungeons to be able to start the Dwarven Research quest and obtain its rewards.
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]FAQ[/font]
  
  

  
* **How long is the typical dwemer beard:** Roughly 10^35 Planck lengths.[/\*]
**Are there any secrets in this mod:** The scientific method encourages experimentation in order to reject the null hypothesis.[/\*]
  
* **Is this compatible with Dwemertech:** All of the third party ports of Dwemertech to SSE seem to be broken at the moment, so no.[/\*]
