# Fearsome Fists - Hand to Hand Patch
- Author: MichaelDawn

This mod replaces the Fortify Unarmed Damage enchantment of the Fearsome Fists gloves with a unique perk that increases the base unarmed damage of non-beast races by 5, allowing humans and elves to have the same unarmed damage as Khajit and Argonians when used with SimonMagus616's [Hand to Hand](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59790) addon for Adamant. The bonus is based on [Aetherius](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26686)' racial bonuses for Khajiit and Argonians.
  
  
The unarmed damage effect is treated as "base" unarmed damage, and should scale appropriately with Hand to Hand's perk tree.
  
  
This effect is handled by a scripted perk, the same as the Silver Sword's bonus damage. This means all Brawler's gloves are also enchantable, allowing you to add your own Fortify Unarmed enchantments on top. I suggest this is best used in combination with [Thaumaturgy](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57138).
  
  
**Compatibility**Incompatible with GreyMatter90's [Fearsome Fists - Thaumaturgy Compatibility Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59989), as they are both attempts to essentially fix the same issue. Pick the one you like best.
  
  
Incompatible with any other mods that edit the Brawler's gloves stats or enchantments, but textures and model replacers that don't use a plugin should be perfectly compatible.
