[color=#ff8844]**Overview**[/color]
  
The ENB Extender adds various features to ENB that improve the overall user experience. Ranging from (external) shader caching, to extensions of both the DirectX compiler and shader GUI.
  
It now also features a custom ENB Helper, so you only need to download a single file.
  
  
  
[color=#ff8844]**Preset Overlays**[/color]
  
A powerful feature for both ENB users and preset authors that allows for extensive and non-destructive editing/layering of parameters.
  
Can be used to save (relative) custom tweaks or pre-load your ENB with various optional configurations.
  
  
[color=#ff8844]**Input blocking**[/color]
  
Blocks input for mouse and keyboard (and optionally gamepads) while the UI is open.
  
  
[color=#ff8844]Automatic **backups**[/color]
  
Never lose your edits again with this feature. Backups are done before saving and/or on an interval (every x seconds the UI is open) or triggered manually.
  
  
[color=#ff8844]**Per weather** everything[/color]
  
Enables you to add weather separation to any external shader variable you desire with a simple annotation.
  
  
[color=#ff8844]**Auto time of day**[/color]
  
Automatically computes the correct times for ENB's time of day system from the current climate and keeps them up-to-date.
  
  
[color=#ff8844]All about that **cache**[/color]
  
Implementing the missing link to ENBs own caching system.
  
Allowing all (external) shaders that were previously recompiled everytime to now be cached.
  
  
[color=#ff8844]**Quality of life** improvements[/color]
  
Adds a "Save and Apply" button that does, well, both operation with a single click of a button.
  
No more forgetting to save if you want to refresh your ENB.
  
  
[color=#ff8844]Evolution of the **GUI**[/color]
  
Tons of features have been added that allow you to design and tweak the GUI of your shaders just the way you want to.
  
Custom grouping, free re-ordering, fixed and improved string support, parameter binding and much more.
  
Make your GUI your own.
  
  
[color=#ff8844]**Compile time** GUI[/color]
  
In addition to the other GUI changes, the extender now allows shader developers to include preprocessor defines into the GUI and configs.
  
Meaning even more customization possibilities without unnecessary FPS sacrifices.
  
  
[color=#ff8844]**Additional data**[/color]
  
Supplies a few more variables to allow for more advanced post processing effects.
