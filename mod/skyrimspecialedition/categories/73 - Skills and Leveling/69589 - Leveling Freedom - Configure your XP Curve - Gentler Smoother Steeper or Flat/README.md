Welcome to **Leveling Freedom**, or:
  
  

**---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
LEVELING UNLEASHED:
  
TOPPLE THE MOUNTAIN AND ASCEND TO GODHOOD IN A LIMOUSINE
  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

(We agree, that title is a bit much. There's not even a real Limousine.)
  
  
**What does this do?**
  
  
This mod gives you control over the shape of the leveling curve in the game. You can adjust how quickly levels come at first, and how much more they cost as you level up - if more at all. Configurations are also saved with you character, so you can have multiple different characters at once.
  
**What does this change?**
  
  
**fXPLevelUpBase:**
  
  
This is the base amount of XP required for each level. In vanilla, this is 75 XP, which is completely insignificant.
  
  
**fXPLevelUpMult:**
  
  
This is the additional amount of XP required to level up, which stacks with each additional level. In the base game, this is 25, which causes the curve to increase very sharply.

This mod does not touch Skill Leveling for two reasons: To maximize compatibility, and because the difference it makes isn't very significant.
  
**Why do I want this?**
  
  
You could have your own reasons, but I made this mod since the leveling in Skyrim is extremely drastic, going from very shallow to very steep around level 30. If you're anything like me, you want to start a new character once you reach that point, which means **you never get to see late-game content.** This mod allows for your character to progress more smoothly into higher levels to encourage you to continue to invest in a character for longer.
  
  
**Why is this an MCM?**
  
  

  
* An MCM allows you to configure it how you want.
Settings are saved with a character (save game), allows for multiple characters.
  
* One mod file is easier both for users and me.
No "boot & pray", information and confirmation in-game, in realtime.
  

  
**Technical Details**
  
  
**Installation** can be done at any time, but it is recommended to use this with a new character just for consistency. 
  
  
**Configuration** is very easy. Simply open the MCM and select your desired values at any time. The values are retrieved from the game when the MCM is opened, and therefore act as an easy way to confirm that the settings are correctly applied.
  
  
**Previous Levels** are not afffected. If you make a change, it applies to your current and future levels only. There's no good way to award or retract previously earned levels. This is why it is recommended to install this very early in your playthrough and configure it once, but you don't have to.
  
  
**Performance** impact is practically zero. This mod only has one MCM script. Everything is done in real-time in MCM or briefly on loading a save. During gameplay, the mod is asleep.
  
  
**Uninstallation** can be safely performed at any time. There are no permanent edits.
  
  
**Compatibility and Recommended Mods**
  
This mod is compatible with everything... except for [Skyrim Configuration Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85707), which forces all its values and is not recommended for use.
  
  
[Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751) is recommended, and in fact this mod was made specifically with it in mind. The recommended preset remains the same whether you are using it or not.
  
  
Yes, Skyrim SE and AE are both compatible. 
  
  
**The Origins of This Mod**
  
This mod is inspired by [Evildavo's](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/11075813) [Gentler Leveling Curve](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54759/) mod for Legendary Edition. The existence of that mod and other for SLE is also the reason I will not make a version of this mod for SLE. I "stole" some of the numbers from his presets since they made sense.
