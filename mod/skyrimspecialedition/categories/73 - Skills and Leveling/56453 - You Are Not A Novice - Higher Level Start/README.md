Do you think it's odd that the Dragonborn has barely learned any skill before coming to Skyrim?
  
  
Do you find the early game tedious and would like to skip to the fun part?
  
  
Are you itching to try out that new quest mod, but it requires a high level and a fresh start?
  
  
Then this mod is for you!

Description[/font]**
  
  
After entering Helgen Keep and getting your bindings removed, the mod will activate and you will be presented with a series of menus. You will be asked to pick a class and a level of proficiency, and after confirming your choices some of your skills will be increased. Alternatively, choosing "I am a novice" at the start will close the menu and allow you to remain at level 1 and continue the game normally.
  
  
There are twelve classes to choose from, broken down into three specialties. Each class has three major skills and three minor skills. All class skills receive an increase, with major skills being increased more than minor skills. Additionally, class with magic skills also receive appropriate spells. See details below for each class.
  
  
There are four proficiency levels to choose from, from apprentice to master. This determines how much major and minor skills are increased, and, for spellcasters, how many spells are learned. See details below.
  
  
The skill increases will make your character level up, exactly as if the skills had been increased through normal gameplay. So the final step is to open the skills menu and pick your attributes and perks. Note that because of the way character experience works, how many levels you gain will depend on how much your class skills match your racial skill bonuses. An altmer mage, for example, will gain a few more levels than a nord thief for the same proficiency level.

Installation & Update[/font]**
  
  
Installation is straightforward. Use your mod manager of choice, or simply extract the archive in your Data folder. All plugins are ESL-flagged, so they won't take a full slot. [SKSE](https://skse.silverlock.org/) is required.
  
  
An optional file is available for an alternate way of starting the mod. A book called "You Are Not a Novice" will be added to your inventory at the start of the game. Read it to activate the mod and pick your class and proficiency. The book will be removed from your inventory after reading it, or when gaining a level the normal way for the first time. This option is recommended if other mods need to initialize before YANAN, see below.
  
  
Updating the mod on an existing character should be safe. It will NOT change the skills and spells of the character, however. Only new characters will be affected.

Performance & Compatibility[/font]**
  
  
This mod contains only one script that runs once, at the start of the game, and never again, so performance impact should be minimal. It does not modify any records and it increases skills and level through the regular leveling system, so it should be compatible with pretty much anything unless otherwise noted.
  
  
**Alternate start mods** are compatible as long as character creation happens *before* control is given to the player (which is when this mod triggers). Changing the race of an already leveled character is likely to screw up the skills.Tested and confirmed to be compatible with:
  

  
* [Alternate Start - Live Another Life](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/272)
[Skyrim Unbound Reborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27962)
  
* [Alternate Perspective](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50307) (thanks to Rhypon)

  
**Mods that modify starting skills** such as [Character Creation Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2725) or [Classic Classes and Birthsigns](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2725) are compatible (if perhaps redundant), but should probably go first. In case of doubt, use the "Book Start" optional file.
  
  
**Mods that drastically alter how leveling works** may cause YANAN to not work correctly, or may not work correctly. Combine at your own risk.

Recommendations[/font]**
  
  
[WHO HA BEGONE:](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37806) gaining many levels at the same time will make the level up chant play on a loop for several minutes. Use this to suppress it if you don't want to wait it out or save & reload.
  
  
[Optional Starting Spells:](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1300) so that you only start with the spells granted by your class, if any.
  
  
[Timing is Everything:](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25464) delay the start of level-locked quests so they don't all trigger at the same time.
