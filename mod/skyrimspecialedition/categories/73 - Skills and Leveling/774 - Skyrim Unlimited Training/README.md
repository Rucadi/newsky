You can now train as much was you want without waiting to level up. All you need is the gold for training. It makes training more like Morrowind. This mod goes well with my [Skyrim True Master Trainers](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/772/?) since it allows you to train your skills up to 100 with a master trainer.
  
  
Also of you have Oblivion check out my [Oblivion Unlimited Training](http://oblivion.nexusmods.com/mods/44392//?).
