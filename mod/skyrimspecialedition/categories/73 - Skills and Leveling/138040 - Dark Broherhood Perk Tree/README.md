This mod adds a new Perk Tree for the Dark Brotherhood. You spend normal perk points to unlock the perks. What perks you can unlock depends on what quests you've completed for your dark family.
  
  
  
***Perks:***
  
**Worthy Targets:**You deal 10% more damage to and take 10% less damage from miners, beggers, and lumberjacks.
  
  
**Hit and Run:**
  
You are 10% harder to detect and move 10% faster while sneaking.
  
**Babettes lessons:**
  
Rank 1: Poisons applied to weapons last for an additional hit and you gain 25% poison resistance:
  
Rank 2: Poisons applied to weapons last for two additional hits. And Poisons you mix are 10% more effective.
  
  
**A Crushing Objection:**Your sneak attacks do 20% more damage and your stamina regenerates 10% faster.
  
  
**Singed Combat Veteran:**Your weapons and destruction spells do 5% more damage and your fire resistance is increased by 10%
  
  
***Dancing with the Void:***You grow stronger when you're under 50% health. While your foes grow weaker when they're under 50% health.
  
  
(To elaborate how this one works. If the person you're attacking has under 50% health your attacks will do 10% more damage and bypass 50% of their armor rating. If you have under 50% health. Your power attacks cost 20% less stamina and your armor rating is increased by 20%.)
