Firmament** adds three new skills to Skyrim, fully integrated to the game with their corresponding potions, enchantments, trainers and more! These new skills are: **Horseman**, **Exploration** and **Philosophy**.
  
**Horseman** and **Exploration** consolidate already existing mechanics - mounted combat and survival - while **Philosophy** brings back perks from Daggerfall and encourages an original, less combat-focused playstyle. With this mod, my hope is to enable the creation of new fun builds for your characters, and fresh ways to play through the game.
  
  
This mod was designed as an add-on to the excellent [Constellations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/117352), which gave us **Hand-to-hand**, **Athletics** and **Sorcery**. Together with **Firmament**, this brings the total number of skills in Skyrim to 24.
