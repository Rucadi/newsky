A simple mod with 4 perks allowing you to get up to 80% magic resistance. It requires Alteration, and uses vanilla perks to be unlocked. if you wanted to roleplay someone who doesn't use any magic, alchemy, or enchanting you could take these perks to help out. 
  
Perks
  
Resist Magic I- 20% Magic Resistance 
  
Resist Magic II- 20% Magic Resistance 
  
Resist Magic III- 20% Magic Resistance 
  
Resist Magic IV- 20% Magic Resistance 
  
  
I may make a version that requires heavy armor to unlock the perks if you guys want it. If you truly wanted to play some type of anti mage that can resist magic.
