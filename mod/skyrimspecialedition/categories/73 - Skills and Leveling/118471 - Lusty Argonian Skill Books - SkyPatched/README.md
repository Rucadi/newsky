# Lusty Argonian Skill Books - SkyPatched
- Author: Brayven
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/118471


Basically a SkyPatched version of [this](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29709) mod.
  
  
Differences from original mod:
  

  
* The Sultry Argonian Bard teaches lockpicking instead of one handed

  
Recommendation
  
  
For a truly immersive experience, I recommend [The Real Lusty Argonian Maid](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30327)﻿, which this mod is compatible with, thanks to SkyPatcher. You probably also want [Reading is Good](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42026)﻿, so you can actually read the book without feeling bad for wasting a skill point.
