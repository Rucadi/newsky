This is the English translation of Vicn's [new perk tree﻿ mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46425?)﻿ - Hand to Hand (renamed Pugilist in this translation). 
  
  
There are two ways to access the perk tree (with update 1.1.0).
  
  
Travel to the Shrine of the Pugilist and commune with the **Diamond of the Grand Champion**.

[size=3]Or, if you always want to have acces to the perk tree and don't mind some additional clutter in your inventory, simply buy the item called **[Perk] Pugilist** from the merchant at the shrine (you can also buy perk potions, a manual and fist weapons from him if you have the gold to spare).[/size]

Simply activate the Diamond of the Grand Champion in front of the statue or click on the Pugilist statuette in your inventory and the skill tree will open.
