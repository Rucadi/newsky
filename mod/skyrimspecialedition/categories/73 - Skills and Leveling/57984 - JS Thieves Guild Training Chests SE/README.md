**About this mod:** 
  
  
By default, the Training Chests in the Thieves Guild are set to reset every 10 game days, assuming that you have not entered the Cistern. This makes them impossible to train lockpicking on.
  
  
**Training Chests now:**
  
  
• Instantly reset when picked
  
• Provide an EXP reward to Lockpicking, which is further increased by Rested Bonuses & The Thief Stone
  
• Contain a small Gold reward relative to lockpicking difficulty (Novice: 2, Apprentice: 3, Adept: 5, Expert: 7, Master: 10)
  
• Are owned by the Player, to prevent unwanted Bounty from Thieves Guild members
  
  
**Note:**These chests cannot be used for storage, your items will be lost. You can however use these chests to delete any items you don't want in your game.

1) Is this compatible with any existing or future Thieves Guild overhauls?
  
• Providing that mod author does not delete the original Training Chests, there shouldn't be any issue.
