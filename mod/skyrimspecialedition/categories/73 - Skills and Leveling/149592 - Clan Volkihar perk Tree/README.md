This mod Adds a perk tree tied to the Clan Volkihar faction. What perks you can unlock depend on what quests you've completed for them. You use normal perk points to unlock perks. Clan Volkihar was the last major faction I hadn't made a perk tree for. So I thought I would wrap up my faction perk tree series of mods before moving on to more story driven mods. This will be my last perk tree for the foreseeable future. But I may update old ones.
  
  
***Perks:
  
  
One with the blood:***Vampire Servant, seduction, and embrace Shadows last 3 times as long and are more powerful. While at stage 4 of vampirism or in vampire lord form your health is increased by 50.***One with the Dead:***Your Necromancy spells have 40% greater duration. In Vampire lord form you may summon or raise two additional undead or Gargoyle servants.
  
  
***Night Stalker:***You're 25% harder to detect and do 25% more sneak damage while in dark places. Your unarmed attacks in vampire lord form do 10 additional points of damage.
  
  
***Free from the sun******:***
  
Your attacks and offensive spells do 25% more damage at night, in interiors or when the sun is obscured by blood cursed arrows.
  
  
***Strength from purity:***Your Stamina and Magicka regenerate 10% faster per stage of vampirism in both human and Vampire lord form.
  
  
***Vampire Royalty:***People always seem to do what you tell them to do. Illusion spells are 20% more effective. Buying and selling prices are 5% better and Intimidation attempts are 10% more likely to succeed.
