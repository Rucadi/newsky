This is the English translation of Vicn's [new perk tree﻿ mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45120)﻿ for GLENMORIL. That's all there is to it, really. :)
  
  
With version 2.0.0, there is now only one way to access the perk tree: add the [Perk] Insight item via console or AddItemMenu (location based activation of the perk tree may come with Glenmoril update).

  

**List of all perks in the Insight tree:**

  
  

  
* **TBD** (they were changed in version 2.0.0)

**How to install:**

  

  
* make sure you meet all the requirements
download Custom Skills - GLENMORIL
  
* install with your mod manager of choice or manually unzip the files to your Skyrim Data folder
let it overwrite existing Perk-Glenmoril.esp (you need to do this, otherwise you won't get the translated text and you'll end up with the dreaded rectangles everywhere)
  
* activate the mod and sort your load order with LOOT or manually if you know what you're doing
play
