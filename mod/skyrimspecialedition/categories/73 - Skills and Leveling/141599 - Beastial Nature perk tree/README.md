I've had this one laying around for a while. But kept not publishing it because I wasn't really happy with it. But believe it or not it just sitting there didn't make it any better. On the up side I have tested the perks quite a bit so at the very least they should be bug free. Which of my mods I think are good and what are popular often don't go hand in hand. So who knows maybe people will like it more then I do. Anyways. Here's a perk tree.
