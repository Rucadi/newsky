This is the English translation of Vicn's [new perk tree﻿ mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45026)﻿ for VIGILANT. That's all there is to it, really. :)
  
  
There are two ways to access the perk tree (with update 1.1.0).
  
  
Travel to the Shrine of Stendarr and commune with the Horn of Stendarr.

[size=3]Or, if you always want to have acces to the perk tree and don't mind some additional clutter in your inventory, use console commands or mod like [AddItemMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17563)﻿ to add the Idol of Stendarr to your inventory. Or simply buy it from the Argonian merchant at the shrine (you can also buy perk potions from him if you have the gold to spare).[/size]

Simply activate the Horn of Stendarr in front of the statue or click on the Idol of Stendarr in your inventory and the skill tree will open.
