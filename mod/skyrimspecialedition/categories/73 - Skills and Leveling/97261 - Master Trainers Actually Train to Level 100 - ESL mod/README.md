This mod sets the max training level to be level 100 with Master Trainers, also editing their dialogue topics' conditions so that you won't be refused training once you're at level 90 and exit out of the training window. ESL mod, won't take up a plugin slot.
  
  
There are 2 versions, one for vanilla and one for those using the USSEP. Use 1 or the other, not both.
  
  
The unofficial patch has since been updated since the USSEP version of this mod was, [this is the version of the USSEP that this mod was originally made for.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266?tab=files&file_id=392477)
  
  
If the latest version of the USSEP doesn't work with this, that's the last version that definitely does work with it.
  
  
  
I've also added an optional file for anyone using [The Forgotten City mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1179), which enables Gaia to train you to 100 in Speechcraft. That addon requires a main file. Flagged as ESL.
  
  
Added another optional file for [Vilja's](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6722) mom, Idegun, which enables her to train you to 100 in Alchemy. Flagged as ESL.
