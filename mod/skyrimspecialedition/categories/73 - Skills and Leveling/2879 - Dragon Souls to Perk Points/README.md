[heading]NEW 3.0 UPDATE[/heading]
  
Thank you all for hanging in there for so long! I've finally gotten around to rewriting the mod and added a lot of requested features. Check the update section further down for more details but basically you can customize a lot more now in the settings!
  
  
A lot has changed so please let me know if you find any bugs. Sending me a private message on the Nexus forums with your load order will also be greatly appreciated!
  
  
~~I stayed up way to late finishing this and will be posting updated screenshots soon(ish)~~! - Done now!
  
  
All screenshots show the default settings after first installing the mod. Out of the box it's the same as the previous version. (Costs 5 souls to exchange for 1 perk point, with new features not enabled)
  
  
For clarity: the mod file itself is a .esp file but flagged as esl so it won't count against your load order.
  
  
**Default settings:**Spoiler
  
Souls per exchange = 5
  
Perk points per exchange = 1
  
  
Increase souls cost per exchange = disabled
  
Amount to increase by = 1
  
  
Perks received per exchange increase/decrease/disabled = disabled

~~01/19/2025~~ 01/21/2025:
  
 ﻿~~3.1~~ 3.2 Release.
  
 ﻿Fixed invalid ESL flag. (For anyone interested and for future reference: I needed to remove the ESL flag and save, then go through the process to make it an ESL again.)
  
 ﻿Deleted and replaced spell books in same locations to hopefully fix issues with the books not appearing for some players.
  
 ﻿If anyone still has issues with the books not showing up in High Hrothgar or at The Throat of the World, please let me know and also provide your load order/mod list/collection so I can troubleshoot further. Thank you!!

[heading]Description:[/heading]
  
Adds a spell tome to the Throat of the World and the shrine at the entrance inside High Hrothgar that
  
will teach you a spell to convert your extra dragon souls to perk
  
points.
  
  
I mainly made this as an intro to papyrus... however I decided to upload
  
it because there's not a mod that does the same thing available yet for
  
SSE, and I'm not sure if or when the authors of similar mods will
  
reupload them for SSE.
  
  
I'll be honest... I'm terrible at spelling, so please give me any feedback and suggestions!
  
  
Thanks guys!
