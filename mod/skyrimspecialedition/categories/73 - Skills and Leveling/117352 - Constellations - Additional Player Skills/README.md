*Constellations* expands the selection of skills in Skyrim to bring the total count of skills from 18 to 21. The new skills come with corresponding skill trees and are designed to complement the vanilla skills and perks. The three new skills are as follows:
  

  
* **Hand-to-hand** - The skill governing unarmed combat. This skill was inspired by the Hand-to-hand skill from Morrowind and Oblivion.
**Athletics** - The skill governing movement speed. This skill was inspired by the Athletics skill from Morrowind and Oblivion.
  
* **Sorcery** - The skill governing staves and scrolls. This skill was inspired by the Sorcerer class from Daggerfall and Morrowind, and incorporates elements of the Enchant and Mysticism skills from Morrowind.

This mod was made to showcase the new features in **Custom Skills Framework** v3.
