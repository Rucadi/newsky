You unlock the perk by completing great major acomplishments as the dragonborn and spending normal perk points. While each perk has it's own unique requirments. None of them require any of the previous perks. What perks you can unlock is entirely determined by what quests you have completed.

***Future Plans:***Add a perk for killing Karstaag. Maybe add a perk for the Thieves guild and the Dark Brotherhood? I don't know what do you think would they fit this perk tree? Add perks for quest mods (as an optional patch so they don't become requirments).
