wayward knight is a modular, female only heavy armor set themed after an informal breton knight; a full set of plate armor paired with a casual miniskirt and croptop
  
  
my aesthetic targets a stylized dimorphic look but without compromising on practicality(much) or the cool factor
  
  
the set features a full casual outfit you can wear on its own as a out of combat style, with a few more variant items where applicable, like less armored or pulled up versions !!

![](https://files.catbox.moe/xs5twe.png)[left]mod features 4 main slot items (armor, gauntlets, boots and helm) and 8 accessory items (skirt, innerwear, pauldrons, couters, rerebraces, tassets, legguards and helmet tail) each with their own variants.
  
  
the mod is modular, but **intended only to be worn with itself:** the body slot items are the core, and stuff is added onto it afterwards.
  
the mod is barely sfw when the set items or innerwear & base armor/top are equipped, but very susceptible to upskirts without adjusting the skirt length in bodyslide. there are also dedicated nsfw items in the pulled variants[/left][size=6]
  
item legend:
  
B = variant, generally less armor or shorter
  
Set = variant with innerwear included for skin indentation effect
  
Pulled = pulled aside for innerwear, pulled up for top and skirt. on Set, Pulledx2 means both the top and innerwear are pulled
  
S = less armored variant
  
0, 1, 2, 3, 4 = cloth color variants for main slot items, respectively red, green, purple, white and black.
  
![](https://files.catbox.moe/9xbvps.png)[/size][size=3]items are not craftable but found near the entrance to [Cracked Tusk Keep](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Cracked_Tusk_Keep)﻿ tucked in a little crevice in a nearby mountain with the hunter tent & bear cave poi. (check last image of this mod page, or the videos tab here)
  
  
a variant chest next to the main chest contains color variants. use these as alternatives
  
  
items have steel plate stats and main slot items (body, hands, head, feet) can be tempered with the steel plate perk and steel ingots. [/size]

**WHAT ARE THE SET ITEMS ???**
  
  
items prefixed with set include the innerwear onto the body so i can add a skin indentation effect via the slider "-b skindent inner".
  
this is unfortunately pretty fragile and can clip a lot with bigger body presets, so make sure to use the adj sliders "-a adj inner sides" & "-a adj inner" when building these if you notice the mesh digging too much into the skin.
  
  
normal items do not include underwear nor [size=3]underwear skin indents for use with standalone underwear items
  
  
[/size]set items include underwear & underwear skin indents for use without standalone underwear items
  
  
  
**WHY AREN'T SOCKS SEPARATE!!**
  
  
this is so i can add a skin indentation effect via the sliders "-b skindent stock overflow", "-b skindent stock press" and "-b skindent stock press radial". for this i needed to do custom geometry for the body meshes, and after some testing i couldn't get a good result on the regular and custom body meshes at the same time
  
  
**WHY ARE THERE WEIRD BODY SLIDERS???**
  
  
they're inherited from how i did support for the 3BA UBEA body. **these are not supported so don't touch anything that's not already in your 3ba preset!!**
  
they're just in there because idk how to 100% optimize bs projects yet. the two prefixed with ahz are custom sliders i built to imitate uunp shapes.
  
your preset won't have these sliders so they won't do anything on their own. you should not touch them or they'll cause disparities with the rest of your outfits that don't have these sliders
