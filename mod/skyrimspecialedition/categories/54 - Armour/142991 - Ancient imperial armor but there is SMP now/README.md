# Ancient imperial armor but there is SMP now

I started putting this together before I realized this is a pain in the ass. The close vicinity of the metal plate on the right thigh makes me want to cry. Also the fact that there are two separate pieces that are supposed to move independently of each other in the front and back and they are so close together.
  
  
This adds SMP to the chainmail skirt, the three leather flaps in the front and back, the two dangly cloth pieces on the chest, and the hanging bit of leather on the back of the armor.
  
  
This mostly works but there's a lot of subtle clipping just because all the meshes are so close together, it's practically impossible to fix all of it.
  
  
Someone else can feel free to carry on the torch and make it better if they want?
  
  
These are bodyslide files using [urbon's conversion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/142700) as the base for HIMBO and BHUNP; [pentapox](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/142702) for 3BA. Get the rest of the bodyslide files for gloves and boots there if you'd like.
  
  
Requires the original mod, bodyslide, and some modding acumen like knowing how to install FSMP and everything related to it. This just provides the bodyslide files, rigged and weighted meshes, and the xml.
