Moon Monk's Robes, manually refitted and converted to CBBE 3BA with no breast or butt physics (Unless I missed something) and support for Khajiit and Argonian females. You can find any of my bodyslide conversions under '[pentapox]' in the Bodyslide outfit filter.
  
  
Requires the original file, the CBBE patch by Ousnius and Caliente and all requirements for CBBE 3BA.
  
  
  
**As with all my conversions, I must stress that I do not take requests for personal conversions or for 'skimpy' or 'daring' versions of outfits, nor will I do HDT-SMP for outfits that did not already have it.**Credit goes to [miliyx](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/64756896) for all the above screenshots :)
