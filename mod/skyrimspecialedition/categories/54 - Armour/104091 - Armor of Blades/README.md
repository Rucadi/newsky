This mod adds a standalone heavy armor set and one handed sword inspired by Jack of Blades and his iconic Sword of Aeons from Fable!
  
  
The armor and one handed sword all share the exact same stats and recipes as vanilla Daedric armor, which means you craft them at a forge under the Daedric section! (Or use console commands/[AddItemMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17563))
  
  
Armor in game is named ''[Armor Piece] of Blades''. Weapon is ''Sword of Aeons''.
  
  
No HDT SMP on this mod, Males and Females have custom meshes. Textures are all 4K Resolution!
  
  
There are 3 main files for this mod. The ***Chapters Version*** will make your armor appear how it does in the screenshots titled ***Chapters Version***. The ***Render version*** will make the armor how it appears in the screenshots titled **Render Version**. The ***Royal Version***was a request to make the armor cloth purple. The only visual difference between the **Chapters**, **Royal and** ***Render*** versions are the textures.
  
**[b][color=#00ffff]There are multiple versions of some armor pieces for visual differences.**
