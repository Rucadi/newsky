Many people may remember this, it was originally an [Oldrim armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49953) by comrade1280. There's a couple of SSE conversions of ebony valkyrie out there, but this is my take of it.
  
  
Here it has been converted to CBBE 3BAv2, BHUNPv4, and HIMBO with various mesh adjustments and repainted weights. The pieces have also been separated out for mix and match.
  
  
There are new heels variants on top of the original boots, and the helmet also has a new version added with hair. There's also a couple of zap sliders added. Overall the gauntlets and boots should also have a slimmer/narrower profile which I think looks better.
  
  
Pieces:
  
- Boots (three versions, boots and two heels variants)
  
- Chestplate
  
- Cuisse
  
- Elbowguard
  
- Gloves
  
- Helmet (with hair or without hair)
  
- Pauldrons
  
- Poleyns
  
- Vambraces
