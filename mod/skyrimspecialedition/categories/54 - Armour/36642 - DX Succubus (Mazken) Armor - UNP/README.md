Sheogorath, the Daedric Prince of Madness, abandoned the Shivering Isles to wander Tamriel and cause mischief.
  
Before going back to his realm, he had his Dark Seducers travel to Whiterun and steal Andurs' amulet of Arkay.
  
They placed it inside the catacombs in the Hall of the Dead to cause him, of course, some trouble.
  
However, one of the Dark Seducers accidentally dropped the ancient recipe of her
  
powerful armor before returning to her master ...

• Every single mesh was made from scratch and it's unique to Skyrim.

• The outfit was made using Photoshop, Crazy Bump, Blender, Outfit Studio and Nifscope.
  
  
  
• All the recipes will only be available as long as you carry the crafting manual in your inventory.
  
When you are done crafting store the manual and your crafting interface will be free again.

You can use assets of this armor inside Skyrim SE Nexus as long as you credit our work in the comments and you
  
don't make an almost duplicate of this mod. Meaning, this armor can be used to dress followers or be part of
  
a bigger project and assets like parts of this armor can be used to supplement your own armor creations.
  
  
Please don't copy the textures if you are making a conversion.
