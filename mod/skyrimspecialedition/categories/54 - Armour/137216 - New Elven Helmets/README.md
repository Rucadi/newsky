Nothing too fancy, just a few helmets I threw together in blender, while drafting a concept for a personal-use armor mashup. Uploaded here as a modder's resource but also as a playable mod.
  
  
They are balanced with the vanilla elven helmet, and craftable with the elven smithing perk. Also they will use whatever textures you have installed, and were built with compatibility for Xavbio's textures.
  
  
They can be acquired through crafting or found in console.
  
  
Helmet names:
  
  
-Elven Decorated Helmet
  
-Elven Simple Helmet
  
-Elven Visor Helmet
