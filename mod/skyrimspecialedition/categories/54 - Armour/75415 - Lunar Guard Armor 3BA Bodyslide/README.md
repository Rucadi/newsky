Same rules as my other conversions - no physics and no demands. I've lowered breast slider power as the chest piece is distorted otherwise. There should be no clipping whatsoever.
  
  
Huge credit for Deydranos for what is honestly the highest quality armor for Skyrim released in months.
  
  
Requires 3BA.
