**Info:**
  
 A new craftable armor with many variations. Four different type of dresses, many types of socks, stocking, trousers, etc. It comes with a new bow "The Eclipse" and also new type of arrows and quiver to match the armor.
  
You can find the Armor parts under the Dragonscale category and the bow and arrows under the Daedric.
  
All items are very powerful and the requirements to craft them are equally high.

**Notes:**
  
 This is the seventh armor of a series that will hopefully reach twenty four armors. I came up with the idea when I saw the Minidresses Collection mod by Tiwa44 who did an awesome job converting some of the long dresses to mini versions. So I started experimenting with his meshes to see if it's possible to convert them into armors and I came up with some very creative results.
  
  
 These armors will not offer any protection in real life so don't use them at home!
  
  
**A big THANK YOU to all of you guys that donate, endorse, comment or just play with this or any of my previous mods!**

If you want to avoid gathering the materials (because they are many, I know :),
  
there are enough materials inside the bag of crafting supplies to create each of the recipes once.
