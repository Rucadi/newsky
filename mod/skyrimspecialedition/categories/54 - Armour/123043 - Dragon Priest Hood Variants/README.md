**DESCRIPTION**
  
  
As some of you may know, dragon priests, and especially their masks, are my favorite part of Vanilla Skyrim. And even though I am really proud of my [Dragon Priests Retexture](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/101101), one thing I've always struggled with is to figure out what to wear these masks with, as the hoods clip with pretty much everything. One of the solution is to use something like [Armory of the dragon cult](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/94244), which adds robes specifically meant to go with the hoods, but this still didn't really fix the issue. Instead, my friend [Delta](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Delta/about-me?gameId=1704) and I had the idea to let you convert your masks into different variants (visuals only, no stats change). All the different variants leave the mask untouched but swap the hood. The vanilla masks are untouched by this mod, so you can still use them normally.
  
  
The goal of this mod is to add more visual variety and let you use these masks also looking good! At launch, we cover the 2 masks added by [King priest](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59652) and the mask added by [wyrmstooth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45565). We also have patches for [Artificer - An artifact overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99619), [Reliquary of Myth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31612) and [Constructible Object Custom Keyword System](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81409).
  
  
[Dragon Priest Retexture SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/101101) will be the only hard requirement, as all the textures here match the ones I made for this mod and the mask meshes use my mesh settings from this mod as well. I also recommend using my [robes retexture](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/110655) so the hoods fit with the vanilla hoods, but it is not required.
  
  
Mesh and Textures do by myself, Plugins done by Delta.
  
  
**HOW TO GET THE VARIANTS**
  
  
You can swap between variants by going to any tanning rack. The variant options will only show up if you have the specific vanilla mask in your inventory (so if you have Krosis only, you will see the krosis variants but not the other masks'). Changing variant is free and you can always swap back to the vanilla version, at any time. The only variant that has a requirement is the archmage hood one. You will need to have completed the college of winterhold's questline to be able to craft those. All variants can also be used at the altar in Bromjunaar Sanctuary to get konahrik.

This is the only variant added to Miraak, as we found the other ones did not fit the mask well enough.
  
  
  
**Variant 5 - optional - CC necromantic Grimoire required**![](https://i.imgur.com/VwJCDaO.png)
  
  
This 5th variant is optional, as it requires the CC Necromantic Grimoire to use. FOMOD lets you decide to use it or not.
  
  
**MOROKEI AND NAHKRIIN OPTIONS**
  
  
Just like my dragon priests retexture, this mod will let you pick between blue or gold morokei and black & silver, black & gold or silver & white nahkriin. It is very important that you choose the same options you chose in dragon priests Retexture SE's FOMOD.
  
  
**Morokei Blue Gem
