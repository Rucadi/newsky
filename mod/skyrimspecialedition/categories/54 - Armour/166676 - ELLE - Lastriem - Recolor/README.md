# ELLE - Lastriem - Recolor
- Author: Ellxe and ghostofhelgen
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/166676


This was initially a private mod to have an additional all-black set for my own game, however I decided to add additional colors for the top, while the extras in black. There are no additional pants.
  
  
The new armors will use the same meshes you have already built when you installed [ELLE] Lastriem.
  
  
Same crafting requirements as [ELLE] Lastriem.
  
  
What's in the mod:
  
  
Top: Jacket in Black, Blue, Green, Red and Yellow. Corset in Black.
  
Everything else but the pants: Black
  
  
Additional Requirement:
  
  
On top of Ellxe's requirement, B.E.E.S will need to be installed due to differing version of Creation Kit.
