What is this?
  
Inspired by Sfozinda's fantastic [Variations texture and armour mod](https://sforzmods.tumblr.com/sse_variations)﻿, I always thought I wanted sleeved versions of the vanilla armours but after using Variations I realized I missed the charm of a large half naked man running at me. So I thought "Why not both?"
  
  
Using Sforzinda's meshes, I've added sleeved variants for the following standard armours
  

  
* All 3 Fur Armours
Hide
  
* Studded
Scaled
  
* Leather
Iron
  
* Banded Iron
Steel A
  
* Steel B

I've now added a separate file that covers Imperial armours 
  

  
* Light
Studded
  
* Heavy

  
These all are simply titled "Warm \*X\*" in-game, can be found throughout the world(including enchantments) and can be crafted with the original armour plus a piece of leather. At the moment they are evenly distributed with the normal versions of the armours.
  
  
FAQ
  
Why do my textures look different to the ones in your screenshots?
  
Well that's because outside of 2 or 3 of the female armours, Sforzinda's models use entirely vanilla textures and meshes or whatever texture replacer you're using eg the white sleeves for Leather Armour in my screenshots come from [Frankly HD Thieves Guild Armour](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19953)﻿.
  
  
Can you make a patch for \*X\* mod?
  
Honestly? No idea. This is the first mod I've made. Thing like Morrowloot and Summermyst are a bit out of my pay grade atm but if you make one feel free to share it! I'm happy to host the patch here if someone sends me it
  
  
Recommendations
  
These'll probably all need patches but I'll get to work on it ASAP
  
[Sleeves for Guards](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18077)﻿ (Highly recommended, works out the box)- This essentially covers what I want to do with Guards, with the added benefit of built-in chance distribution. I highly recommend anyone who wants Sleeved Guards updated to use this
  
[Cloaks of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6369)﻿ (Highly recommended, works out the box)- For additional warmth in the cold depths of Skyrim
  
[Fashions of the 4th Era](https://sforzmods.tumblr.com/sse_fashions)﻿ - A fantastic pack of new clothes and armours scattered throughout the world by the creator of the meshes in this mod
  
  
To-Do
  

  
* Add sleeves for ~~Imperials~~(Done), ~~Stormcloaks~~(Use Sleeves for Guards), Forsworn and anything else that interests me from Variations. Most of those will probably be separate .esps due to them being faction aligned and people might have separate mods for them
Implement [Dynamic Items for Everyone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40370)﻿ patch﻿
  
* Add optional .esp for Warmth values for Survival/FF players (I recommend [Survival Control Panel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41891)﻿ in the meantime)
A FOMOD to pick n choose once more armours have been implemented
