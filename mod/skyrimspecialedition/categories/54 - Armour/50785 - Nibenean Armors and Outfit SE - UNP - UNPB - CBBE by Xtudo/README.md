An armored leather fur cape, with or without hood (light armor and clothing).
  
* An armored leather choker (light armor).
A circlet (clothing).
  
* All outfits/armors fits perfectly UNP, UNPB and CBBE.

  
All items are craftable (no requirements), and you can temper them too.
  
The stats are the same that the vanilla Scaled Armor (light armors), and Nord Plate (heavy armors).
  
The mod is fully standalone.

**Optional downloads:**
  

  
* **Dynamic Lowered Hoods patch.**
**4K Textures** version for the main outfit/armor.
  
* **No dagger.**
**High level player version.** Intended for high level players (40+) with 100 blacksmith. The armor stats are the same than the Dragonplate, and you will need the same materials to craft them. And you can also temper all the armored items. 
  
The v1.1 of this file adds armored circlets and a heavy armored hood.
  
**I made it for my game and now I'm sharing it, I hope you like it.**
