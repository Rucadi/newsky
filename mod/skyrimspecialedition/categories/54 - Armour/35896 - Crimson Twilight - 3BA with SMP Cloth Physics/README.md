Changelog

  
2.0: Changed to 3BA, a more up-to-date body based on CBBE SMP. Greatly improved weighting for *realism and immersion™* (bits covered by metal don't bounce, uncovered bits do)
  
1.3: Fixed a small bone weight problem that was present in the original bodyslide conversion.
  
1.2: Similarly for the coat
  
1.1: Now includes an option for the older style of breast physics. Build "Crimson Twilight - Armor SMP BBP" in Bodyslide to use it.
  
1.0: Initial release
