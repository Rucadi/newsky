If you already have all the Requirements.
  
  
Install this armor using Vortex or Mod Organizer 2

(must look like this)
  
  
or
  
  
*maybe you can just use the manual method,
  
  
by extracting all the files in the Main File
  
into The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition / Data
  
but in my opinion using Mod Manager is much easier
  
and even MO2 doesn't contaminate
  
your game data folder*
  
after that,
  

  
* Open Bodyslide
Check Build Morph﻿﻿
  
* Hit batch build!
You will see the list ﻿
