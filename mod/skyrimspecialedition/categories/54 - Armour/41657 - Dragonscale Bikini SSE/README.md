**//////////ABOUT THE MOD\\\\\\\\\\**
  
  
Available for your modding pleasure and for the first time in THREE EFFIN' YEARS (at least until *[these guys](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41585)*﻿ stole my thunder!)\*\* is a brand new bikini armor: The Dragonscale Bikini Armor set. Conceived completely by yours truly with the vain hope of grabbing NiseTanaka's (the OG creator of the bikini armors) attention so that I can at last reconnect with someone who I consider my buddy. That and maybe get a few bottomless tributes in the process as well, I mean why not?
  
  
The bikini set sports over 30 new pieces of gear with Bodyslide files also available with HDT-SMP variants included!
  
  
  
\*\*The following quip was just a good natured ribbing will no genuine ill will intended.
  
Seriously I wish this guys good luck and you really should check them out.
  
  
**//////////IN GAME ACQUISITION\\\\\\\\\\**
  
  
The book for armor can be found at [Bonestrewn Crest](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Bonestrewn_Crest_(Skyrim))﻿, lying right next to a treasure chest, which itself is next to the word wall.
  
  
Once the book is in your possession, you'll need the "Dragonsmithing" perk to actually forge the armors.

Q. You actually learned how to make a bikini mod JUST to get Nise-kun attention?!
  
  
...yeah. I did.
  
  
  
Q. Why didn't you add this to Tawoba?
  
  
As proud as I am that I was able to pull this off, I don't think it belongs in Tawoba. I kinda see my bikini as a "bootleg" of sorts compared to his quality, if that makes any sense.
  
  
  
 Q. For once this isn't the most shameless thing you've done but its still well up there.
  
  
That's... not really a question but yeah. I'm kinda shocked.
  
  
  
  
Q. No 3ba version?
  
  
A. ~~I could never get it to work for my Skyrim so nah. I do allow for open permissions to make your own conversions. =)~~Yeah scratch that its a thing now.
