Welcome to the first mod of a new series of mods and collaborations designed to expand my storytelling world and share my stories through mods for Skyrim. This isn't the same as my old ColdSun's World replacers (now obsolete). In the future when you see the above ColdSun's World logo, you will know its part of this new mod series. They won't be followers or replacers either. Expect armor mods, armor re-textures, and other special ideas for mods I'm not ready to talk about yet but that should make playing with my followers more fun.
  
  
This mod is designed to be the official uniform for my Heartbow Rangers. These followers include Kayle, Solvi, and Samandriel. Expect a SPID assignment mod by [Gonzeh](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/38227690) to be released for these followers to wear this outfit soon. I'll be releasing a Visions version of Kayle soon!
  
  
A big thank you to [Ashtoreth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/108345998) for converting this outfit from the Daz store. She did a fantastic job. Make sure you [check out all of her wonderful work](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/108345998?tab=user+files). Because this mod is a Daz store conversion, we will not be collecting any DP. I paid for the entire thing out of my own pocket to share with the community and I plan to do more like this in the future.
