You can find the outfit and the crafting manual in Solstheim at the end of "The Winds of Change" dungeon.
  
  
To start your adventure enter the Raven Rock Mine and check what's bothering Crescius Caerellius.
  
You have a long journey ahead so come prepared. When you reach the end you will find the black
  
book named "The Winds of Change" that will teleport you to your final destination.
  
  
If you've already cleared the location you can teleport back at any time by reading the black book.
  
  
Also if for any reason you can't find the items, exit the dungeon normally, save and quit.
  
Make sure the mod is activated and restart the game. From any outdoors location in
  
Solstheim read the black book to teleport back to the location and collect. :)

A new mage outfit with emphasis on conjuring and poison damage with many customization options.
  
  
  
  
Has no armor stats but offers nice bonuses for mages.
  
The masks give 25 more points of speechcraft and 50 mana.
  
The tentacles make conjuration spells cost 25% less mana,
  
give 150 extra mana and provide immunity to poison damage.
  
Also they apply poison damage to any enemy that comes near
  
with a [cool visual effect](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/4482/4482-1563039167-561941793.png)﻿ when you enter combat.
  
  
You will still get damage from the pools in Apocrypha because that's water damage
  
for some reason and there is no countering it. \*looks at Bethesda\* >.>
  
  
You can craft it with the crafting manual or loot it at the end of the
  
dungeon along with the Seeker Summoning spell.

This outfit offers two ways to acquire it. Besides the crafting manual you can loot it
  
whole from a chest. I did this because it takes so long to reach it and I figured a reward
  
at the end is fitting. You can also craft it later if you want to replace the enchantments or
  
give it to followers etc.
  
  
The reason the initial version is 1.1 is because after seeing the screenshots and the video I
  
wasn't entirely happy with the textures and did a complete overall. Now the outfit has much
  
more details, depth and more refined textures. ^.^

The inspiration for this and most of my outfit mods came from [Minidresses Collection mod by Tiwa44](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/47376/) who did an
  
awesome job converting some of the long dresses to mini versions.
