Welcome to the next outfit that I commissioned from Ashtoreth. This is another light armor. It is licensed from the Daz Store and will not be collecting Donation Points. Any conversions must also forego collecting donation points.

* Light Armor a little better than Elven Armor. There are 4 pieces for the outfit: Bolero, Corset, Pants, and Boots.
Can be crafted and improved. Those who want the armor right away can use Additemenu to get it quickly.
  
* The outfit comes in 5 different color variations.
ESPFE plugin to save a slot in your load order.
  
* 3BA Only - conversions must follower the rule of not collecting donation points.
Includes the *Survival\_ArmorWarm* keyword to keep you warm in the cold Survival mode.

* Install this mod with your mod manager (or manually).
Run bodyslide with your chosen body preset to generate the meshes. The mod comes with a group file to slide all pieces at once.
  
* To update this mod, download the newer version and replace it (do not merge). It is completely safe to update mid-game.

As mentioned in the comment policy, support is limited on this mod page and its comment section. Head over to our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/JrpPh6F2tu) if you have problems. Most issues can be resolved by load order adjustment, or re-downloading assets or mod if the download has been corrupted (yes - it happens).

Want to get an inside look at my current and future projects before anyone else? Do you like seeing screenshots of my creations as I work on them through iterations? Well, you can see those things and more if you join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/JrpPh6F2tu) in the #coldsuns-corner channel. I'm usually hanging around and even like to hear ideas and suggestions from the community.
