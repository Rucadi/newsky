# Elle Bifrost Armor - Optimized and Upscaled Textures
- Author: Ellxe - XilaMonstrr
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

The original textures were uncompressed and mostly in 2K.
  
I have upscaled them using [chaiNNer](https://github.com/chaiNNer-org) and [ESRGAN models](https://upscale.wiki/wiki/Model_Database) to a max of 8K resolution and re-compressed all textures in [modern BC7 format](https://www.reedbeta.com/blog/understanding-bcn-texture-compression-formats/) with full mipmaps. I have also downscaled the textures to provide a variety of resolution options.
  
  
I will most likely be doing some alternate color versions of this armor, but I'm very busy with other projects right now, so I wanted to get this out for you to enjoy. If you want to see other colors, please track this mod, and if you have ideas I invite you to post them in the comments. Thanks!

We know from experience that modding is an extremely addictive past-time and can be a slippery slope from creating a simple load order to porting mods to going full boat and attempting to rebuild Skyrim from the ground up. That's why we believe in a community that integrates Xbox and PC gamers along with porting noobs and experienced mod authors. We all have more to learn, and modding Skyrim to its extreme is a community effort to say the least.
