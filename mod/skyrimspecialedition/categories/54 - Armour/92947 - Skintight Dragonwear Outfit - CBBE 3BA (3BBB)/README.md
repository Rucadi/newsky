This mod is a [CBBE 3BA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30174) port of [lostdaywalker](https://www.nexusmods.com/Users/4099314)'s [Skintight Dragonwear Outfit for LE from Loverslab](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/229-ldws-crimson-closet-for-unp-slim-unp-unp-and-unpb/). It includes a light armor outfit and a heavy armor outfit in several colors. In order to get the items in-game, you can make them at a forge, use a mod such as [AddItemMenu - NG](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71409) to add them to your inventory, or simply add them to your inventory using the [console](https://skyrimcommands.com/).
  
  
If you are not familiar with how to use Bodyslide to generate meshes for outfits to match a body preset, then check out the documentation for [Bodyslide and Outfit Studio](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/201) as well as any tutorials that it links to. This mod does not include any default meshes, so Bodyslide needs to be used for it to work.
  
  
I did make some tweaks to the original mod aside from converting it to SE and CBBE 3BA:
  
  

  
1. Blue, gold, green, purple, and red variants of each outfit have been added.
The outfit conforms more closely to the body than was originally the case. This might cause some clipping under the breasts with extreme presets but otherwise looks better. The meshes have also been cleaned up in general.
  
2. The esp has been converted to an ESPFE and renamed, so it will be considered a different mod from any other version of this mod, and it
     
   has different record IDs. And, of course, as an ESPFE, it won't take up one of your plugin slots.

Requirements:
  
\* [CBBE 3BA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30174)
  
\* [Bodyslide and Outfit Studio](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/201)
  
\* [RaceMenu High Heels](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18045) (if you don't want the heels to sink into the ground)
