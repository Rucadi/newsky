# Vampire King's Armor
- Author: Chakra SSE
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/105620


This mod adds a standalone armor set and one handed sword inspired by Volkihar Vampires.
  
  
You could call this a remake of my [Harkon's Battle Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49369) mod.
  
  
The armor and sword all share similar stats and recipes as vanilla Ebony armor, which means you craft them at a forge under the Ebony section! (Or use console commands/[AddItemMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17563))
  
  
Armor in game is named ''Vampire King's [Armor Piece]''. Weapon is ''Vampire King's Blade''.
  
  
No HDT SMP on this mod, Males and Females have custom meshes. Textures are all between 512x512 to 2K Resolution! If anyone wants there to be a HDT SMP version, **message me and we can discuss!**
  
  
There are 2 main files for this mod. The *Monarch* will make your armor appear how it does in the screenshots. The *Vanilla version* will make the armor use your own retextures. (Amidianborn, xavbio ect)
  
  
Any other versions you'd like to see? Ask!
  
  
Optional plugin file will remove the Load Screen.
  
  
**Read credits and permissions please.**
