**Features**
  
  
**Zap Sliders**
  
  
Almost every outfit piece comes with Zap Sliders for more customization options.
  
- The combined piece (Regalia of the Scorned) can be customized to the same extend as the individual pieces.
  
- What are Zap Sliders and how do I use them?: 
  
Spoiler
  
Zap Sliders can be used in BodySlide to hide specific parts of an outfit. For example you don't want a vambrace on the left arm, just click on the slider box and it won't show in game.

**Choose your color**
  
 
  
The Outfit comes in 7 slight color variations. (Default, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue and Purple).
  
- Can be selected in the fomod installer.
  
  
**Combined outfit**
  
  
The outfit comes in 13 pieces. You have the option to combine them to reduce the item count to 3 pieces (boots, cuirass, gloves basically).
  
- Go to a forge and craft 'Regalia of the Scorned'. It requires 11 of the outfit pieces.
  
- You will end up with 'Regalia of the Scorned', 'Scorned Arms' and 'Scorned Heels'.

**Crafting Tool**
  
  
It is a item which you must have in your inventory to see all the outfit pieces in your crafting/smithing list. The idea is to keep your crafting/smithing list clean once you've crafted the outfit. Just put the tool in a box or your house and the pieces will be hidden.
  
- The tool is optional. You can choose the 'without tool esp' in the fomod if you don't want that feature.
  
- It can be found alongside the armor (see **'Location'** section further down in the description).

**Location**
  
Note 1: If you don't want to get it the hard way you can use [Additem Menu](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17563) or console commands.
  
SpoilerType in the console 'help scorned' and it should appear a list with all items and their ID. Now type in 'player.additem xxxxxxxx 1'. Instead of the 'xxxxxxxx', type in the ID of the item. It should look like this (just an made up example)
  
player.additem D18DF9E1 1 
  
Note 2: The tool and the outfit are at the same spot.
  
  
**Hint (if you want to find it yourself)**
  
  
Look for the Deathbells in Folgunthur. A Nord Ruin between Morthal and Solitude.
  
  
**Detailed description (if you want to know exactly where to find the armor)**
  
  
Spoiler
  
Travel to Folgunthur and enter the ruin

Progress through the dungeon until you find a dead mage next to a dragon claw - keyhole﻿. Loot the mage for the dragon claw and activate the keyhole.

Progress further until you reach a gate with 4 levers in front of it. Activate the front left and back right lever to open all 4 gates.

Progress further until you reach this room. There are 2 thrones with a lever next to them. Activate either one of the two levers and enter the left room.
  
There you should see 3 puzzle pillars. From left to right, the combination should be: "Bird","Fish","Snake".
  
Now go back to the room with the 2 thrones, activate the chain and go down the stairs.

Now you will reach the crypt. When you enter it you should see some deathbells peeking through to your left. Go up and you should find a coffin covered with ivy.
  
The armor is in the coffin and the crafting tool (if you installed the defult esp) lies on top of it.
