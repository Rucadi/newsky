# HDT-SMP Yaldabaoth Armor Patch

**Added cloth physics to the skirt and cloak of the armor.
  
Only some meshes files.**
  
  
Chakra SSE made the weight change files for the armor, but he did not enable the weight slider in the armor addon of the esp file.
  
I'm not sure why, but if he changes the esp file, this physical patch also supports body shape changes.
  
  
  
**Require HDT-SMP (Skinned Mesh Physics) OR FSMP - Faster HDT-SMP.
  
Also require original mod.
  
Then use this patch to cover it.
