Added male weight sliders to [Wind Ruler Armor SE - hdt-SMP Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63036?tab=description). Before you had to choose either physics from that, or weight sliders from [Wind Ruler Armor - My patches SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60893?tab=description). Now you can have both. Male only for now. 
  
  
Requires original hdt-smp version. Overwrite with my meshes after instaling it.
  
  
  
Known issues :
  
  
Some slight clipping on the shoulders while walking and running which came from the original mod. SMP version has it too and I couldn't fix it atm.
