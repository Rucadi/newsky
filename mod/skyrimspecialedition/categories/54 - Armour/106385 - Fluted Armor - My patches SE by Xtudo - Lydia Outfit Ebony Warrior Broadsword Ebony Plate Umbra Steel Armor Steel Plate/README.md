**My patches by Xtudo**

**Description**
  
**My edits for this wonderful armor made by 4thUnknown.**Only the **Miscellaneous Files** are 100% compatible with the HDT-SMP Fluted Armor Patch. Installation instructions below.
  
  
**Fixes/tweaks v2**

  
* **It will work with any Skyrim version, but you'll need a clean save if you already installed it in the last 1.6.1130 version.**
Carried on the Unofficial Skyrim fixes.
  
* Added the "Warm" keyword to all the armor pieces, for the Survival mode.
Removed the PerkFistsSteelPlate and ArmorGauntlets keywords from the Pauldron and Scarf.
  
* Optimized the cubemap texture.
Created facegen files for the Wanderer NPC, to avoid the black face bug.
  
* Fixed female boots record, which had the male boots assigned.
Removed footstep sound from the cuirass record.
  
* Proper weight sliders added.
Fixed missing arms in 1st person mode, if you're only wearing the gauntlets. This will conflict with BodySlide mods, like BHUNP or HIMBO, please install their patches too.
  
* Full beast races support.
Changed Pauldron's bodyslot to "shoulder", to avoid conflict with backpack or similar mods.
  
* **Even if you have the last Skyrim version I recommend you to install my patch, as it has other improvements/fixes. And it will be compatible with my future upgrades to this mod.**

  
**Optional files**
  

  
* **Lydia Outfit SPID patch.** It will give the armor to Lydia. Standalone. It only requires the original meshes and textures. But you can use both plugins without any problem.
**Ebony Warrior Outfit SPID patch**. Armor stats and effects matching the ones from the Vanilla one. Standalone. It only requires the original meshes and textures. But you can use both plugins without any problem.
  
* **New Shield and Broadsword replacer.** It will replace the Vanilla Dwarven Shield and Sword located next to the dead Wanderer. They can be enchanted and tempered. Two versions, one for the Main file ESL, and other for the ESP, install only one.
**3BA, BHUNP and HIMBO patches**. Fixed the missing items for the BodySlide versions made by pentapox and Urbon.
  
* **CC Ebony Plate replacer**. Requires one of the Main files installed first.
**CC Umbra replacer.** Requires one of the Main files installed first.
  
* **Vanilla Steel Armor Replacer**. Requires only the textures from the original mod. It will perfectly work together with the Fluted Armor or Steel Plate Replacer, so there's no problem to install both.
**Vanilla Steel Plate Armor Replacer**. Requires only the textures from the original mod. It will perfectly work together with the Fluted Armor or Steel Armor Replacer, so there's no problem to install both.
  
* **Vanilla Ebony Armor Replacer.** Requires only the textures from the original mod. It will perfectly work together with other Replacer patches.
