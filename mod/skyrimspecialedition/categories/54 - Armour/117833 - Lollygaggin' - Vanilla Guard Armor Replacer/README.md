**(\*ᴗ͈ˬᴗ͈) Please do take the time to read the Mod description first if you have any questions! [size=3][b](\*ᴗ͈ˬᴗ͈)**[/b][/size]
  
  
To people **who are very kind to showcase the mod in their videos** - please understand that it may create confusion if you don't keep the vanilla helmets on in the videos. This is based upon NordwarUA's work from Sons of Skyrim, Guards Armor Replacer and Vanilla Armor Replacer.
  
  
I have a bit of anxiety (not a bit, but severe lmao), so exposure like this is very new to me and can get a bit hazardous - so please clarify that the **meshes/textures are again created by NordwarUA** and are based on the mods above, just with vanilla helmets. I just simply created a plugin that replaced them with what I personally used as a mashup before [font=Trebuchet MS]❤️[/font] *Thank you again regardless!*

*I might be in the minority of liking the Vanilla Guard Helmets...* I like the vibes of anonymous soliders who steals your sweetrolls, yet gaslights you for believing someone else stole it. However, I've been a big fan of [NordwarUA's](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/NordwarUA/about-me?_gl=1*3h1zw1*_ga*MTIyMzYzNzQxLjE2OTkyODg0NjA.*_ga_N0TELNQ37M*MTcxNDE3MjI4NS4zODEuMS4xNzE0MTg0MzA1LjAuMC4w) armors over time - especially the works of [Sons of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68656), [Vanilla Armor Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31679) (ported by [JDJ3](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/49262898)) and [Guards Armor Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22671) (ported by [DanielUA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/7067238)), so why not mash 'em up together?
  
I've kept this mod for my own personal use for some time, and wanted to share it with anyone who'd be interested! ❤️
  
  
  
**⁀➴****⚔️ L O L L Y G A G G I N '** attempts to secure the feel of the Vanilla guards, yet have a diversity of unique armors across the holds. This is done in *not the most conflict-friendly way*, but its build was made to be as lightweight as possible!
  
  
***All credits for the meshes and textures goes to the talented [NordwarUA](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/NordwarUA/about-me?_gl=1*1czl6uo*_ga*MTIyMzYzNzQxLjE2OTkyODg0NjA.*_ga_N0TELNQ37M*MTcxNDE3MjI4NS4zODEuMS4xNzE0MTc3NTY2LjAuMC4w)!**Note: [I used Xtudo's desaturated textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/104126) for the screenshots, however the files include the original textures (2K) from the OG mods which are still great!*[/font][font=Trebuchet MS]

1.[/size][/size][size=3] ***Mid-save Installations can cause some issues!*** ⋆˙⟡♡[/size]
  
All my mods get tested on New Saves - as it's not always the best practice to uninstall/install mods mid-save![size=3]
  
 ﻿- The mod **may or may not cause naked guards** if installing this mid-save. [/size]*(I've had some mixed reports)*[size=3]
  
 ﻿- This may also be caused by **uninstalling previous replacers** mid-save - or anything that touched the outfit records for the guards[/size] *(via SPID, script or just outfit records)*[size=3].
  
  
To alleviate this (*if you really insist on installing this mid-save*):
  
Open the console - and type the console command '**resetinventory**' on the guards that are being lewd!
  
**Apologies again for not being more clear about this! [font=Trebuchet MS][b]❤️**[/font]

✅You are allowed to modify the mod, and then upload it as your own as long as you credit me - (publicly and privately).
  
***❗IF YOU'RE ONLY REPLACING SOME OF THE ARMOR MESHES - Consider to include my plugin, or don't, it's mainly for ease of use.***
  
✅You are allowed to create patches! (SkyPatch it, SPID it, up to you!)
  
**❌Please do not include any of my mods in paid modlists.
  
  
*I used NordWarUA's assets, so please credit appropriately and read their permission usage beforehand!*****❤️Feel free to reverse-mod my plugin if you want to make your own Guard Replacer!**
  
  
  
[size=3][size=3][size=2]**⁀➴**[/size][/size][/size] I'm not open for edits, in the case of using another mesh for a certain Guard Armor - **this is my own personal choice**. You can configure it on your own if you wish to!

**Finally,**
  
I'm a person who enjoys modding Skyrim on her freetime, along with training to become [big buff Nord](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53264)﻿ at the gym with a 9-5 job. Therefore, I might be very bad at replying at once! *Sorry about that!* ( • ᴖ • ｡)

> ﻿[color=#ead1dc][i]The comments are locked waaah, sorry**([size=2]not really mwahah*!)*.
  
I kinda couldn't separate a specific nasty part of the Skyrim modding community from the actual Skyrim game itself, and it made the game just rotten to me for some reason, so I kinda stopped playing it.**I decided to just lock comments + just not have comments enabled in my* *maybe(?)* *future mods, in order to just have a peace of mind* *(and to kind of prevent weirdos from entering my PMs hmm...)**.**I kinda want to just focus on having fun modding and playing other games without overlooking mods I just randomly share whenever I feel like it.
  
  
If I do publish mods in the future, I will make absolutely sure that things work --* *at least for the load order I have heh**e*, *+ add an FAQ(?) so hopefully Bug Reports aren't needed! and troubleshooting on your own is much easier!*
