[size=4]I have created bodyslide files for the hood and all wig variants. They now support both physics and bodyshape.
  
Fixed some clipping issues, such as those on the Corset and Chest belt.
  
Redone the bodyslide file for the gloves. The wrist size can now adjust according to the bodyshape.
  
**I have also merged the Dark Brotherhood armor into the esp file. Players can wear the black and red armor set just like any other color variant.**

I have added physics to many armor parts.
  
If you want to disable the physics for a specific part, you can refer to this diagram to find the name of the corresponding part and remove that armor component in BodySlide.
