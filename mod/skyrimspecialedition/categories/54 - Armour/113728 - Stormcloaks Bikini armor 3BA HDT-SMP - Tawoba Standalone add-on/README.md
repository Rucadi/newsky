﻿
  
  
**Installation:**1. Install with your mod manager.
  
2. Use group:*TIWOBA Storm All,* and batch build*.*
  
  
Done.

﻿
  
3. (optional and recommended) Build items with extra sliders and zaps.
  
4. Use group:*TIWOBA Storm Extra Sliders* and build one by one.
  
  
Done.
  
  
  
**Tips for building:**Spoiler
  
After doing the *Basic Installation Main* above:
  
  
- In Bodyslide select group:
  
*TIWOBA Storm Extra Sliders*
  
  
- Go thru items in it one by one, customize to your liking, and build one by one.
  
  
Done.
  
  
**Tips:**
  
As a side note, adjust sliders for both weights, 0 and 100.
  
Press T to hide textures, W will enable wireframe overlay.
  
You can go above 100 or even negative values if you type them in.

**Once you are happy with the sliders, you can save them to your body Preset.**All of the extra sliders and zaps have unique names, so when you open the
  
outfit in Bodyslide next time, it will have the options selected as you
  
saved them. this applies to batch building too.
  
  
You can also build items while in-game (after building once game not running), just re-equip them to see changes.

**Enviromental map textures, metallic cubemap reflections, aka potential mod conflicts.**Spoiler
  
  
**tldr:**
  
**Only** potential mod conflict is your Stormcloak texture replacer, **IF** it adds the env map textures also, that are missing from vanilla game.
  
  
**If it does, let your texture replacer overwrite the env map textures in this one.**
  
----
  
  
xml (physics config files) files are same as some other mods, but they are
  
assigned to own folder, so they won't overlap with original mods.
  
Check Credits tab for more info which mods.
  
  
----
  
  
**Extra info on the env maps that this mod adds:**
  
  
- Based on vanilla diffuse texture.
  
- They do nothing on their own, For *models outside this mod*, [need to be edited to use them](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/9553)﻿.
  
- If assigned to a model, will control metallic reflections.
  
- BC1 compression (very light textures)
  
  
- I assigned: textures\cubemaps\shinydull\_e.dds, as the cubemap for all models.
  
-> If you use non dynamic cubemaps, that is the reflection
  
-> If you use dynamic cubemaps (enb or CS vanilla replacers),
  
you will get dynamic cubemaps in game.
  
  
  
For more info on cubemaps check [this article](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/6392)﻿.
  
  
Only other textures added by this mod, are for the crafting book, same files as in the Officer version of this mod.
  
  
  
  
**How To acquire in-game, CID, BOS, crafting.**
  
  
Spoiler
  
  
At the time of release, there is some SPID or so mods,
  
for example [this one adds these to containers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/155193)﻿,
  
but I won't be making one myself.
  
  
You can add these via console, or various mods that let you add modded content for your character.
  
  
Also, **this mod comes with Crafting book**.
  
As long as you have the book in your inventory, and you have smithing perk for Stormcloak armors,
  
Pieces from this mod show up when crafting. Without book, they don't show up/clutter the crafting menu.
  
  
You can temper the items without the book.
  
  
**To acquire the book in game, I have provided two optional files:**
  
  
**[BoS](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805)﻿ file:**
  
  
Replaces generic book in Palace of Kings, upstairs.

﻿﻿
  
Take note if another mod removes etc these books, they might not be there.
  
  
You can also edit the BOS file yourself;
  
just change the ref id to something else in the BOS ini, select item you
  
want in-game with console, type down the ref id, and the source of it
  
(Skyrim.esm etc), and change the first part of the line in the ini with
  
notepad.
  
  
Edit *TIWOBAStormbook\_SWAP.ini* to make own changes to this.
  
  
**[CID](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99486) file:**
  
  
Distributes the books to various merchants.
  
  
Edit *TAWOBA\_guards\_addon\_CID.ini* to make own changes to this.
  
  
﻿
  
[size=2]**Adding the book without BOS or CID files:**
  
  
The book is called:
  
"Stormcloak Bikini Armor Crafting Guide"
  
  
  
in console, search for example this:
  
*help "Stormcloak Heavy Bikini" 4*
  
will give the id you need.
  
  
If the id is for example FE0018C9 then just use command:
  
player.additem FE0018C9 1
  
  
It will add it to your inventory.
  
  
There is also various mods that let you easily take/explore items from mods, I personally use this:
  
<https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64653>[/size]
  
  
  
  
**Helmet Toggle 2 Support:**
  
  
Spoiler
  
(gif for another mod, but works same way here)
  
![](https://i.postimg.cc/52XVhqkK/The-Elder-Scrolls-VSkyrim-Special-Edition-2025-09-27-15-51-ezgif-com-optimize.gif)﻿
  
  
Automatic support for half helmets (circlets), and masks.
  
  
Masks have own lowered models for HT2,
  
that you can not directly equip in game (not inventory items).
  
  
Beast races are included.
  
  
  
  
**IER, ORF, Baka, Sos and Modesty Support:**
  
  
Spoiler
  
  
Adds own ini for Modesty keywords.
  
Adds own ini for Item equip restrictor, that prevents males trying to wear these.
  
Adds own ini for Outfit Recognition Framework keywords.
  
Adds own ini for BakaFactory SLA keywords.
  
Adds own ini for Schlongs of Skyrim keywords, I recommend using TNG over SoS.
  
  
  
  
**Extra ramblings:**
  
  
Esl is called TAWOBA\_guards\_addon, this started as **quard replacer**,
  
but after starting this I realized the hold guards can be made with texture sets **as add on for this,
  
that I propably will do.**
  
  
**Armor rating/gold value** I tried to balance to what it would be if wearing vanilla Stormcloak set.
  
Boots, gloves, and head piece have same values as vanilla, rest of the modular pieces come close to what vanilla torso is.
  
  
Can be crafted at forge (Requires crafting book in inventory), tempered at armor bench.
  
  
  
As stated above, this uses Stormcloak textures you have installed, for reference to my preview pictures, I'm using [Guards and Stormcloaks Armors Retexture SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98115?tab=files)﻿, and [Simply Better Guard Helmets - 2k](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44772?tab=files)﻿.
