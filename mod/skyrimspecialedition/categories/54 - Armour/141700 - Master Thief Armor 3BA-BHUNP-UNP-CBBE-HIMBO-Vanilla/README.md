[font=Verdana]Fun fact: my modding journey for Skyrim started back in 2014, and one of my first projects was a retexture of the Thieves Guild armor. And now, 10 years later, I'm returning to this faction once again to make something more monumental. And I want to thank right at the beginning all the folks who tested and shot this mod. You are absolutely magicians and made incredible pics, and that means a lot to me ❤
  
  
This mod features a new armor that is completely lore-friendly and suitable for both male and female characters. It's easy to guess that I made an optional replacer of the vanilla Thieves Guild armor in addition to the standalone version.[/font]

[font=Verdana]Armor can be crafted at **Skyforge**. There is no secret meaning to this, I just like having all my mods in one place.  Also, to say it again, you can always install the optional version with the vanilla armor replacer and get it the classic way (by joining the Thieves Guild).
  
  

**The outfit is divided into several parts:**
  
Armor
  
Gauntlets
  
Boots
  
Hood
  
Shoulder Armor (58 slot)
  
Misc Hip Accessories (52 slot)
  
Scabbard on back (57 slot)

[font=Verdana]**Installation**[/font]

  
[font=Verdana]I think that a little explanation will be necessary here. The mod has three main versions: 3BA-CBBE, BHUNP-UNP and Vanilla. All main versions come in 4k. Choose the version to install specifically on the female body, because vanilla male version of armor is already initially included in the main file.
  
  
If you are using the HIMBO body for male characters, install any main version of the mod and download the HIMBO files from the **Optional** section.
  
  
In the same section you can find the Thieves Guild armor replacer and textures with 2k resolution. The armor has only one texture set for all parts, so in fact the 4k version is 2k for each item, and the 2k version of the textures will look like 1k. Choose this setting based on your preferences and PC performance. 
  
  
In the **Miscellaneous** section you can find optional armor files where the leather is more shiny. The authors of the screenshots took pictures of different versions, you can see the whole showcase and decide which version you like better. The basic version comes without a strong shine.
