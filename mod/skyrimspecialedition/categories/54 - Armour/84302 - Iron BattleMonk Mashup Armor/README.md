New version 10/04/2023 with : red robes, improved 1st person and helmet texture 
  
Sorry, but i'm a shitty modder, SMP hood doesn't work 
  
  
  
For ladies (CBBE only) and gentlemen : A new mashup with the Creation Club iron armor. 
  
Perfect (I hope) for Stendarr, Talos and Boethiah followers
  
  
2 armors : with or without iron skirt ; 1 boots ; 1 glove and 3 hoods : no helmet, open helmet and full helmet if your mustache or nose clip.
  
The hood is for the armor only, you can try with something else but it's ugly.
  
4 colors for armor and hood. it use your textures.
  
  
Craftable and temperable, classic iron and banded armor.
  
  
CBBE slider for bodyslide, be gentle with the boobs sliders or you will play with two cocking pot weld on your armor.
  
Base mesh is vanilla CBBE.
  
  
No skimpy zap..... I'm not this sort of guy.......(it's just useless, [Skimped - Iron](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59449) is ten time better)
  
  
Certainly full of bugs, tested only on my computer and data compacted with a beer in hand, so....... 
  
If buggy, I will try to correct as soon as possible.
  
  
ESL
  
  
A big thanks to [Imperial2000](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/7993973) for the super usefull skimped set and permission to use it.
  
  
YOU NEED the CREATION CLUB armor only for textures 
  
  
Some Black Area if you use [Iron Armors and Weapons Retexture](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/84978) Not super nice
