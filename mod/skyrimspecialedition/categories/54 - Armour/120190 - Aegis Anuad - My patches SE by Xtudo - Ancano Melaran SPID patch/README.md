**AEGIS ANUAD**

**My patches by Xtudo**

**Description**
  
**My patches for this amazing mod.**
  

  
* ESPFE that works with any Skyrim version. It's fine to install/update mid-game, you won't loose any already crafted item.
Fully compatible with [RMB SPIDified - Aegis Anuad](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99692).
  
* **Optional 2K and 1K optimized textures.** 2K file is smaller because it has less optimized textures than 1K.
**Non-HDT version.** You can switch between versions without any problem. Standalone. Install only one Main file. I had to remove the cape from the Leather armor as it didn't work fine without HDT. 
  
* **Optional Ancano and Melaran SPID patches**. With and without hat versions available.
**Optional Male Altmeri Glass Cuirass - No Skirt patch**. Based on the Non-HDT version.
