Pulcharmsolis' Breton-themed light armour converted to 3BA with working HDT-SMP as per the original. There should be relatively no clipping and I made sure to reduce warping where possible, but more dramatic breast sliders will break the outfit's shape entirely.
  
  
Requires the original mod and Faster HDT-SMP. Not compatible with mods that replace the .nifs. Not sure if beasts are compatible.
