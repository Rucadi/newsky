DRAUGR WARRIOR
  
Author Chucacu - My patches by Xtudo****Description**
  
**My patches for the amazing armor mod made by Chucacu.**
  

  
* Added female version.
Added unarmored cloak version.
  
* Added clothing pickup and putdown sounds to the cloak.
Added proper 1st person models.
  
* Fixed one typo.
Improved/fixed weapon adjust.
  
* Changed footsteps sounds from light to heavy armor.
Fixed clipping on the gauntlets.
  
* Concealed amulets.
Fixed back of the pauldrons and sleeves of the armors.
  
* Added transparency to the chainmail of the skirt.
Improved bones of the pauldrons, completely reducing deformation.
  
* Adjusted the cape to avoid clipping with the pauldrons.
Adjusted the neck area to better fit beast races, thus removing bad clipping.
  
* Added proper mipmaps to the original 4K textures.
Flagged as ESL the ESP version (ESPFE). It's fine to update mid-game. Activate only one plugin (ESP or ESL).
  
* **Important:** Some item enchantments may appear as 0%. This is a minor bug in Skyrim. The text is too long for the dialog box. But don't worry, the enchantment works fine.
**Integration:** There is an amazing Legendary version buried somewhere in Skyrim. A Solitude guard will sometimes remark, *"The road to Whiterun's not safe these days. Lots of travelers just... disappear, south of Dragon Bridge. Can't find a trace of them.".* [Check out the map](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/110/images/119682/119682-1738784456-255985702.jpeg)﻿﻿﻿ and happy adventure!
