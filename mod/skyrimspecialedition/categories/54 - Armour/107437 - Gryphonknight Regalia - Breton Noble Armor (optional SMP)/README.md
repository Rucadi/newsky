Author's note:
  
  
> As a big fan of [Beyond Reach](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3008), for my second playtrough I wanted to wear some suitable armor. Something formidable enough to be worn by a knight, that would speak of valor and prestige, but still would look like something adventurer would wear.
>   
> So I've took one of my personal character models, fitted it to skyrim character (and it clearly can be better) and started adding more content. Helmet, sword. I've learned much on this journey and I hope you will enjoy playing with it as much as I enjoyed making it.
