[font=Verdana]Here, the same things from the brief description will be repeated. Sellsword is a light armor for female characters, adjusted for most popular body replacers. 
  
  
Armor crafting is located in the Skyforge (because it's convenient for me). You can get it there, or use the console or any ESP explorer of your choice. 
  
  

**The armor consists of**
  
  
Basic Outfit
  
Gloves
  
Pouches (52 slots)
  
Shoulder pads (57 slot)

  
  
Note that the torso and legs are combined into one piece. However, this piece has compensated armor and weight specs, and also this piece of armor contains all the keywords needed for perks to work, so you should have everything working when wearing a full set of light armor. By the way, the shoulder pads use the keywords of the helmet, so your perk will also work when wearing the full Sellsword set.

[/font][font=Verdana]**FAQ**[/font][font=Verdana]Q: Can I use it with vanilla body?
  
A: Nope.
  
  
Q: Can I make a conversion for [BodySlide-name] or [Body-name]?
  
A: Yup, it's just that your patch should require mandatory installation of the original mod and contain only the modified files.
  
  
Q: Can I make a [patch-name]/[addon-name] for the armor?
  
A: Yup, all terms and conditions stated above.
  
  
Q: What is the name of the preset/hair in the screenshot?
  
A: Which one? The author is indicated under each screenshot. Please specify the screenshot number and the author's name at once in questions like this. If the author reads comments and considers it necessary, they will answer your question about the preset or other modifications used. I can't help you here.
  
  
Q: More colors?
  
A: Make 'em yourself. You can find an **RGB** mask in the Miscellaneous section to create your own recolors. If you don't know what an RGB mask is and how to use it, you definitely don't need it.  ![](https://i.imgur.com/i7aMYYU.png)
  
  
Q: I don't like this, can you redo that?
