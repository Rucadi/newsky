[size=5]This is a faithful port of the original mod by [Patobek](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/2670579/?)﻿,
  
who gave open permissions to update and support the mod on SSE.
  
  
Some of you may be wondering why I made this port when there exists already [an SSE port](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10084)﻿ of the mod.
  
To answer that question, I have fixed various issues with it, made quality of life improvements,
  
added more options for the heavy armor, added certain missing keywords,
  
tweaked recipes and armor values to better reflect the external appearence of the armor
  
and finally packed all this in an all-in-one FOMOD installer to pick and choose what you want.
  
  
Many hours have gone into testing and adjusting meshes, textures and the plugin itself,
  
to ensure that there is no clipping, missing keywords or other inconsistencies.
  
For a more detailed break down of the changes, please have a look at the changelog.
  
  
**This is now the official supported version of this mod on SE.
  
The old port is no longer supported and made obsolete by this version.**

Install with the mod manager of your choice and pick and choose your preferred options in the installer.
  
If you were using other versions of the mod, be sure to completely uninstall them before installing this version.
  
  
[/size]Compatibility
  
This is a standalone armor so it doesn't conflict with any other mod, however,
  
 the various addons like bags and satchels use quite a lot of your body slots that other mods may be using too.
  
example of such a mod would be [size=3][Bandolier - Bags and Pouches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2417)﻿.

**Some users reported an incompatibility with SOS.
  
If you want to use them together, don't equip the Intrigue pouches, or the armor will disappear.**

Most of the armour parts can be crafted at a forge with the steel smithing perk,
  
while the rest (bags,pouches and satchels) can be crafted at a tanning rack with no perk requirements.
  
  
All of the addons of the armour can be used with any other armour but they will look weird, 
  
floating or clipping, so I suggest that you stick to using them only on this set. 
  
All of the addons are usable for both the Light and Heavy variants.
  
All of the addons have enchanted and unenchanted versions available for crafting.

Huge thanks to [Patobek](https://skyrim.nexusmods.com/users/2670579)﻿ and everyone who contributed to the original mod.
  
Also huge thanks to [NordwarUA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/53732701)﻿ for making the models used for the gloves and boots
  
of the alternate heavy set, and giving open permission to use them.
  
Kudos to Dimitrisgrr for the first port and for letting me rework the mod and upload it as a standalone.
