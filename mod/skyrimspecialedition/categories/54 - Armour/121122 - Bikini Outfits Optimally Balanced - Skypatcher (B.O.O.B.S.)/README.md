**Balance**
  
B.O.O.B.S. makes all of the listed bikini armors in line with vanilla dynamically. For the purpose of this description i will be using the term "Accessory Slot Items" and "Main Body Slot Items". 
  
  
All Accessory Slot Items have been reduced to Zero Armor Rating. These items include, Shoulder pieces, Tassets, Abs, Thighs, Etc. These items originally had Armor Rating assigned to them that quickly gave you more armor rating then was in line with whatever scaling you were using. Complete Vanilla Steel Armor would be at 150 Armor rating  but if you wore the Bikini Armor Equivalent, the Accessory items would jump you to like 165 armor rating for instance. Making the accessory slot items zero armor rating also allows you to use them as extra piece freely without risk of being OP in other armor mash ups. More flexibility. No Downsides. I've' also removed the ability to add enchantments to these Accessory Slot Items. All done via Skypatcher. No Patches. No fuss
  
  
All Main Body Slot like, Chest, Gauntlets, Feet and Helmets have been rebalanced to be in line with **YOUR GAMES** vanilla equivalent. That's right, they are in line with **YOUR GAME**. Not with Vanilla ( I mean unless of course your game is vanilla scaling!). So Steel Bikini Bra IV = Steel Armor Chest. The Same goes with helmets, gauntlets, and feet pieces. This is done by tasking SkyPatcher with the operation to match the damage resist of your mod lists Steel Armor. No matter what mods you've used to alter it.
  
  
What this means is that A full set of Steel Bikini Armor should have the same exact armor rating as a full set of regular Steel Armor. The Magic of B.O.O.B.S. powered by SkyPatcher.
  
  
**TL:DR of B.O.O.B.S**
  

  
1. Makes all accessory pieces' armor rating zero
Disallows enchanting on all accessory pieces
  
2. Rebalances bikini helmets, chests, gauntlets, and boots to be inline with mod users vanilla armors
