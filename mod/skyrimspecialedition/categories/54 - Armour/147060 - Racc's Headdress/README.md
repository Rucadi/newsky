* Improved Forsworn fur-headdress *(the helmet, as the game calls it)* that remains true to its original design.
Rounded eye openings that don't look like Minecraft.
  
* Redone to fit both male and female characters.
More natural looking antlers.
  
* Inner padding to fix gaps and baldness issues the original has.
Compatible with anything that doesn't edit Skyrim's fur-headdress meshes.
  
* *People in comments keep telling me it makes fighting Forsworn harder as they can see out of their helmets now. \*While through the power of placebo this may actually be true, I'm highly doubtful about these claims as it's just a mesh replacer but you never know. :D\**

  
  
**Installation**
  

  
* Use your mod manager to install the mod.

  
* **For female Forsworn to wear these** instead of their regular horned hair, use **“Forsworn wear Fur Headdress”** in optional downloads. It can be used on its own and is ESL-flagged.

  
  
**Improvements**
  
The following mods can improve the look of your Forsworn textures.

My Discord for instead of being reasonable and saying: “**Racc, No!**”, they said “**Racc, Yes!**” and in the process my entire month became this project.
  
You.
