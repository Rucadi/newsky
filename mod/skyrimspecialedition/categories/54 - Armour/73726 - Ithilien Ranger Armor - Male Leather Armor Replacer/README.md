Got bored by the old leather armor in the base game?
  
You want to play as a stealth archer, an assasin or a lightly armored warrior? This armor might suit you just fine.
  
  
I always thought the leather armor in the base game was just not on par with other armors in the game visually (take a look at the daedric armor, dragonbone armor etc. for example)
  
  
So i want to be the change i want and collaborated with a friend to offer you this armor. This is the first armor i upload to Nexus so any constructive criticism is welcome. This armor is deliberately kept on low size, so do not expect 8K textures or anything.
  
  
**I have used the name Ithilien Ranger Armor. It does not use assets, logos etc. from LOTD. It is just a fitting name for this armor.**
  
  
Compatible with everything, if you have multiple leather armor replacers the latest one will be used by your mod manager though.
  
  
It is only for males right now. Does not have a bodyslide or SMP currently (All of these will be added in future)
