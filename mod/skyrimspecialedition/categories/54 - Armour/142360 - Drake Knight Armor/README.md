This mod adds a standalone Dragon themed heavy armor set and one handed swords.
  
  
The armor and sword all share the exact same stats and recipes as vanilla Dragonscale/Dragonplate armor, which means you craft them at a forge under the Ebony section! (Or use console commands/[AddItemMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17563))
  
  
Armor in game is named ''Drake Knight [Armor Piece]''. Weapons are ''Drake Knight Sword''/''Drake Knight Backblade''.
  
  
No HDT SMP on this mod, Males and Females have custom meshes. Textures are all 4K Resolution! **If anyone wants there to be a HDT SMP version, message me and we can discuss!
  
  
There are 2 main files for this mod. One is the Drake Knight Armor (Craft everything). The other adds the Fallen Dragonborn boss to Skytemple Ruins which you have to defeat to obtain the armor.**
  
  
**If you want the Glow Variant when using the Drake Knight version, replace the meshes in the ''DrakeKnight'' folders with the meshes from the ''Glow'' folders.**
  
**Read credits and permissions please.**
