Updating this mod now that I'm not sleepy (over a year later lol). Be sure to delete the old version and make a clean save before updating! 
  
  
This mod adds a standalone 4 piece light armor to Skyrim!
  
  
The armor shares the same stats and crafting recipe as Ebony armor, but you can only obtain it by crafting it under the Ebony section of a forge.
  
  
Male and Female supported. Vanilla Weight slider supported for both genders. No Bodyslide file included.
  
  
Textures are vanilla, but vertex colours were used.
  
  
No light/cloth version.
  
  
Plugin is ESL. (Won't take mod slot)
  
  
Bugs fixed:
  

  
* [size=5]Armor is now spelled correctly in game
  
Armor now has custom ground models
  
- Armor isn't just called Ebony
Female Version correctly added

All assets belong to Bethesda, I only modified them for this mod.

Note on Collections: I would ask that you don't include these mods of mine in collections without at least asking first, as of right now there is no system that I'm aware of that allows me to make sure people don't. Thanks :)
