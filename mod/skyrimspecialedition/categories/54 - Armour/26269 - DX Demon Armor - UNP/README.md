You can craft the armor at any forge. For the recipes to appear you need the crafting
  
manual in your inventory, you can find it north of college of Winterhold at Septimus' Outpost.
  
The High Heels Racemenu is optional, the difference in height is very small.

[i][font=Times New Roman]A new heavy Daedric armor with a unique shield and war axe.
  
  
  
  
[/font]*The armor has similar stats to Daedric armor but is much lighter.
  
The shield sets enemies on fire when bashing and can't be enchanted.
  
You can enchant the cloak with the shield enchants for your convenience.
  
  
The shield and war axe can be used by both female and male
  
characters in case you just want to use one of the these.

This armor started as Orcish and then I added spikes, then horns, then skulls and then it was too bad ass to be Orcish
  
any more. I would have named it 'Daedric something' but since I have already done that, Demon sounded cooler. :)
  
Like Daedric Reaper this armor is also based on a wonderful design by [tiwa44](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3347902)﻿ from his [UNP Spice Gear collection](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68028/?)﻿.
