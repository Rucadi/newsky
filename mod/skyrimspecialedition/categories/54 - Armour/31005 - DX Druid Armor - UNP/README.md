A new craftable Elven armor, bow and arrows suitable for druid characters.
  
  
The armor has similar stats with Elven armor but has a lot more parts you can upgrade to make it powerful.
  
The bow is almost as good as daedric and very fast.
  
The arrows are similar to daedric arrows.
  
  
There are two skirts to choose from, one long and one short.
  
And three types of underwear, Undies, Leggings and Straps.

Every single texture on this outfit from the color to the height maps was hand painted in Photoshop.
  
The outfit was made using Photoshop, Crazy Bump, Outfit Studio and Nifscope.
  
  
  
All the recipes will only be available as long as you carry the crafting manual in your inventory.
  
When you are done crafting store the manual and your crafting interface will be free again.
