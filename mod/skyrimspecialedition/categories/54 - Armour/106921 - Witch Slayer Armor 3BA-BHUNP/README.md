[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]Witch Slayer - set of light leather armor and a Witchbane sword (*it might even be silver*). In order for the mod to function, you naturally need to install either the **3BA** or **BHUNP** body. And all the recommendations for them, of course. 
  
  
All can be crafted in Skyforge. Why? I dunno, I like it that way. But in the same way nobody forbids you to get it through **Additem Menu**. You are big, grown ups and you know how to do everything without my tips ![](https://i.imgur.com/n2UH7O6.png)
  
  
I recommend installing the retexture on vanilla cubemaps for a better perfomance. You can use whichever one you like, but my choice is [SC - Cubemaps](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38760).

The main outift is available in 6 colors: base (brown), black, blue, green, red, silver.

[/font][font=Lucida Sans Unicode]In the BodySlide files, you can also find a version of the outfit that has the postscript 'Low'. Under this label is the version of the jacket with the collar down. Perfect for characters with long hair. The files built in BoySlide are interchangeable, allowing you to create a high collar version in one color and a low collar version in another.

FAQ[/font]

  
  
Q[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]: Cool, can I have the [color name] version of the vest?[/font]
  
A[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]: You can, but you'll have to make it yourself[/font]
  
  
Q[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]: Can I have a [body type name] version?[/font]
  
A[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]: I made a mod for the two most popular bodies, but do you want something else? Unbelievable. But in general, if someone wants to make a conversion for some other body, you have my permission. Naturally, this conversion should contain only conversion files and require installation of the original mod
  
  
Q[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]: Body is clipping through clothes on large presets[/font]
  
A[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]: Sad. If you use presets with sliders above 100%, you can fix the outfit yourself in OS, all files are attached to the mod[/font][/font]
  
  
Q[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]: I don't like the boots/other part of the clothes[/font]
  
A[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]: No one is stopping you from replacing it with something else in-game or in OutfitStudio
