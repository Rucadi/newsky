Ancestral Tombs are incredibly important to Dunmeri Culture. Traditionally, they were protected by the reanimated spirits of the ancestors. Because of the taboo nature of necromancy to protect their tombs, some Redoran take a sacred oath to become a Tombwarden. These warriors stand watch over the resting dead, ensuring that the tombs remain undisturbed by graverobbers, blasphemers, and foul necromancers. Some Tombwardens possess such a strong connection to their Ancestors that they can even call upon them to help in battle.

This mod adds a collection of Redoran themed armors, clothes, and weapons.
  
  
The heavy set and weapons are on par with ebony while the light set is on par with glass. To get the armor, you can craft it after completing the March of the Dead quest and advanced armors perk. The clothing can be crafted at the tanning rack after completing the quest as well.
  
  
Alternatively, you can find an armor set, sword, and shield by exploring a long lost cave outside of Raven Rock

  

Spoiler
  
A long dead Tombwarden can be found inside Coldcinder Cave, on a rock island surrounded by Netches.

The armor and weapons can also be found on three new Tombwarden Guards that stand watch outside of the three Ancestral Tombs in Raven Rock. If you use SPID, Adril Arano, Cindiri Arano, and Lleril Morvayn should wear the new Redoran clothing added by the mod.

Please don't ask me to add HDT Physics, my laptop can't run skyrim at the moment.﻿
  
* The mod adds new furniture and decoration to the bottom of the Raven Rock Temple, but as far as I'm aware, it shouldn't conflict with things.
