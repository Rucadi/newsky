This mod introduces naming consistency between the original [Wayward Knight Set](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/112793) armors and the ones from [Wayward Knight Set - Addon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/119509), by adding their color as a suffix so it's easier to distinguish which armor set is which.
  
  
I've also included crafting recipes for all of the armors.
  
  
Crafting recipes were taken from lautasantenni's [Wayward Knight Set - Craft Only](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/118351)﻿ mod. Their permissions are open so I decided to include them.
  
  
**All crafting recipes require the Advanced Armors perk.**
  
  
The reason I included these is that it makes more sense to have the crafting recipes as a standalone addon, instead of replacing the original mod's esp(which is what the Craft Only mod does) since if the [original Wayward Knight mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/112793) ever gets updated the crafting mod would then invalidate any future updates.
  
  
I was planning on making crafting recipes for [Wayward Knight Set - Addon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/119509) also, but after tediously going through and renaming all of the armors in the original mod, then seeing that there were 121 new items included by the addon, I really did not feel like doing this.
  
  
 If anyone else decides to do so, please leave a comment and I will leave a link to your mod in this description to help people find it.
