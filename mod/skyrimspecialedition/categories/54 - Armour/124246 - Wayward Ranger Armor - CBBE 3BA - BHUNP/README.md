How to Acquire
  

  
* **Option 1:** Buy the journal at Warmaidens in Whiterun. Keep the journal in your inventory when you want to craft the armor at the forge or tanning rack. Crafting these requires the base game perks, Steel Smithing and Advanced Armors.
**Option 2:** Use a mod like AddItemMenu to spawn in the items.
  
* **Option 3:** In the console, type [font=Courier New]help "Wayward Ranger"[/font] to look up the armor parts and add with the [font=Courier New]player.additem[/font] command.

  
FAQ
  
Spoiler
  

  
* **The tassets are invisible! Help! :(**
    
  This appears to be a bug in the engine and affects other armors/slots. The armor partitions and priorities are set up correctly, but typically on load, the main part of the outfit still overrides the higher priority tassets, rendering them invisible. **Drop the tassets, pick them up, then equip them.**
**The satchel clips a lot with the unarmored outfit!**
  
The shape of the breastplate is too different from the corset to find a happy medium. Permissions are open if you'd like to have a go.
  
* **It's asymmetric! >:(**
    
  I put zaps in the bodyslide for the left pauldron. Build in BodySlide as you please. *I'm not*, however, going to do mesh edits to the pants to make it symmetric. Permissions are left open for that reason.
**Boob plate!**
  
First of all, *this armor's got nothing on **vanilla steel plate***. Secondly, if you look at the corset underneath, the original Wayward Knight plate's shape looks... uncomfortable, when worn at the same time; I tried to meet in the middle here. Thirdly, if you happen to want *more* boob plate, use BodySlide.
  
* **I want different colors!**
    
  Permissions are open. I recommend toying with cubemaps first and diffuse second.
**Male/HIMBO/BHUNP/UBE version!**
  
Permissions are open. This requires more effort than I am personally willing to commit.
