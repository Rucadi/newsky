You can find the crafting manual in Markath inside the Dwemer Musem.
  
Perhaps it's better to find Calselmo and obtain the key by solving his problem.
  
If you force your way in, the guards will attack you on sight.

A new light dwarven armor.
  
  
  
  
Has similar stats with its heavy counterpart but it's much lighter.
  
You can craft four variations with different transparency levels.
  
Wearing the wings is optional like any other armor piece.
  
It requires Mithril ingots which can be obtained by combining
  
steel, dwarven and silver ingots at any smelter as long as
  
you carry the crafting manual.

For this outfit my main idea was to make an armor looking like a jewelry by itself.
  
Also wanted to play with metals and transparencies to see where would that lead me.
  
I'm so very happy with the results and I hope you will like it as well.
  
On a personal note I can't get enough of wearing it while I play,
  
all the reflections and transparencies really do it for me! :D

The inspiration for this and most of my outfit mods came from [Minidresses Collection mod by Tiwa44](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/47376/) who did an
  
awesome job converting some of the long dresses to mini versions.
