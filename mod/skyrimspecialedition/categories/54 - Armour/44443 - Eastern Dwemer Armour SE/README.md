Feel free to share the mod/assets however you wish.
  
  
Here it is: a set of dwemer armour that somewhat resembles the Morrowind armour's style.
  
  
There's also optional downloads to make the [Morrowind Inspired Dwemer Helmet](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39702) better match this set of armour, and another to replace the vanilla dwarven set.
