HIMBO and CBBE 3BA Refits for [Woodland Wizard Robes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/147529?tab=description) by [Pulcharmsolis](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Pulcharmsolis?gameId=1704).
  
  
- Includes pre-built zeroed meshes and bodyslide files for customization.
  
- Fully compatible with [Woodland Wizard Robes - My patches SE by Xtudo](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/148172?tab=files) (let my refits load after).- Plugin is a light plugin and each Refit has one (however, they are identical, so it does not matter which Refit loads first).

**The base mod is required and the refits have to load after!
