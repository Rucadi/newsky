Masque of Clavicus Vile - Replacer
  
  
Male and female versions
  
I also recommend using this [mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60097)﻿ , because mask looks like the one statue is holding.
  
**Now available as standalone version made by [Xtudo](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/452087) , kudos and thanks to him.﻿ If you want vanilla Clavicus mask, m[b]ake sure you uninstalled replacer mod, before you install standalone version**

p.p.s. There won't be no hood version, to avoid clipping issues with races, hairs and etc.
