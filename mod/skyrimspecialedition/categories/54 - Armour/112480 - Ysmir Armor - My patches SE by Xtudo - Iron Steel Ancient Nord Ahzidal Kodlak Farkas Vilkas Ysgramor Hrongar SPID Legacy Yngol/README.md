**My patches by Xtudo**

**Description**
  
**My edits for this wonderful armor made by 4thUnknown.****About the compatibility with the HDT-SMP mod:**

  
* **[Version .1]﻿ HDT-SMP Ysmir Armor Patch**: All my files are 100% compatible.
**[Version .2]﻿ HDT-SMP Ysmir Armor Patch (Fix)**: Install all my files after it, and let them overwrite all.
  
* **﻿[Version .3]﻿ HDT-SMP Ysmir Armor Patch (for CBBE 3BA)**: Install my Fixes (Fixes, Companions, Crafting, etc.) after it, but don't overwrite the mesh files. My other Optional files like Helmets with Hair, Ysgramor, Kodlak, Steel, Ahzidal, etc, install them last, and let them overwrite all.

  
**Fixes/tweaks**

  
* Carried-on Unofficial Skyrim Patch fixes.
Added support for beast races.
  
* One typo fixed.
Fixed 1st person models.
  
* ESL and ESP files that will work with any Skyrim version.
It's fine to install mid-game, there's no need to do a clean install. It will replace the original 1YsmirArmorSE.esl/.esp file.
  
* All my Fixes files (Default, Crafting, Companions, etc.) are 100% with BodySlide mods, like [BHUNP and HIMBO by Urbon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/112519)﻿ or [3BA by LoRDFeniXXX](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/112539)﻿ for example.
