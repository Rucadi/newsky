**DESCRIPTION﻿**

*Find the body of a long-forgotten Thane of Dawnstar Hold and claim his extravagant armour for yourself! It only smells a little...*
  
  
This mod adds a new heavy armour mash-up to the game, meant to fit into the aesthetic of NordwarUA's armour sets. It is a mashup with a few meshes from the Witcher 3 I ported over. It has the armour rating of steel plate making it a nice mid-tier set.
  
The sash can be equipped or unequipped at will occupying slot 46, same as most cloaks. One can also change the look of the helmet at any forge. Beast races only get one variant of the helmet though, sorry :(
  
The armour is ~~male-only for now~~ for male and female as of 2.0!.
  
Drsemmel made a true HIMBO refit with bodyslide files [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/127575)﻿
  
  
**LOCATION**I'm not gonna tell you >:) I'll give you a hint though:
  
"*Nurelion isn't the first and won't be the last to quest after the legendary phial*"
  
Or you can just use AdditemMenu, but I think it's more memorable if you take it from the previous owner!
