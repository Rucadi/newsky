This is what I call "Silvered Steel" or Barbarian Armor. It comes in both heavy and light versions. The armor's base values are almost as good as Nordic Carved (Heavy) and Stalhrim (Light). This will be my last armor commission for a while as I need to get back to voiced follower work. I hope all of you enjoy!

* 4 Pieces on both the Heavy and Light Armor - Helmet, Boots, Gauntlets, and Armor.
Can be crafted and improved. Those who want the armor right away can use Additemenu to get it quickly.
  
* The outfit comes in 3 different color variations for both heavy and light (a total of 6 outfits).
SMP Physics on the skirt
  
* 2 ESPFE plugins (one for heavy and one for light) to save a slot in your load order. I used two plugins for folks who may not want one or the other.
3BA Only - conversions must follow the rule of not collecting donation points.
  
* Includes the *Survival\_ArmorWarm* keyword to keep you warm in the cold Survival mode.
