﻿The Royal Vanguard armor is the definitive equipment of the queens personal guard.
  
Only the bravest and fiercest women can call themself Royal Vanguards.
  
  
A manual to forge the armor and its weapon are rumoured to be found somewhere in the Blue Palace in Solitude

This plugin has been created with the most recent version of the creation kit, if you are on a game version earlier than 1.6.1130 I recommend you use [BEES](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441) otherwise your game will crash/or wont start. If you dont wanna use that mod you have to set the version of the .esp in SSEdit from 1.71 to 1.70.
  
Install using your favourite mod manager.
  
  
Optional **Complex Material** support.
  
Requirements: ENB
  
Set EnableComplexMaterial=true and EnableDynamicCubemap=true.
  
If these are greyed out in your ingame ENB control panel you have to set them manually in your enbseries.ini located in your Skyrim folder.
  
  
Optional **PBR** support.
  
Requirements: [Community Shaders](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86492).
  
  
Default meshes are 3BA with zeroed sliders. Body slide files for different bodies are included and selectable in the installer.
  
  
Safe to install mid-save.
  
  
Default texture resolution is 2k, higher resolutions are found under optional files. I personally recommend 4k.

Heavy armor set with a matching shield and weapon.
  
Stats are based on Ebony tier.
  
Esl flagged .esp, load early.
  
Immersive physics, the Breastplate will disable SMP physics while being equipped. Done by overriding Slot 50 in the Armor Addon, physics resume when unequipping the Breastplate.
  
Only the Helmet, Cuirass, Gauntlets and Sabatons are temperable to retain balance.
  
Keywords for inventory icons using [B.O.O.B.I.E.S](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89241)﻿ included (optional).
