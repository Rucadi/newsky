Did a quick Upscale on all things Falmer to try and make them look less like a Potato.
  
  
Uses 2K Textures on pretty much everything, 4K Textures for some larger things.
  
  
Their also darkened abit to try and make them look less flat, and more aggressive.
  
  
Added Glow to make the Armor and Weapons look amazing in the Dark, For Player and NPC's.
