[Warmonger Armory](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/50459) (LE) is one of my all time favorite armor mod. Thanks Duckzilla for uploading the [updated version](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17809) to SSE. 
  
Though it is not compatible with [Armor and Clothing Extension](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19002) and many loot mods. The original mod was fine in 2014 when loot mod was not a thing but now it has many conflicts with those loot mods. So I tried to address this issue and end up editing many aspects of the mod to be even more lore-friendly to my taste and some quality of life changes.
  
  
**What have I done......**
  
- Removed all of the edits to vanilla robes in favor of [WACCF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18994) and [ACE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19002) robes.
  
- The dragon mask belts will **ONLY** appear in smithing menu if you have the specific mask in your inventory. So it won't clutter your menu.
  
- Many of the armors can only be crafted after you finished certain related quests. E.g. Alik'r armors only available after you have met Kematu.
  
- Tweaked the level lists to be more compatible and consistent to loot mods like Morrowloot Ultimate. Bash patch is recommended.
  
- Tweaked the NPCs and outfit records to be as compatible to NPC mods as possible.
  
- Rebalanced and renamed some of the armors and weapons.
