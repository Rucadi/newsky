At the end of the 2nd era, Talos or Tiber Septim as he would later be called, was forging his legend and securing his place in history . At only 20 years of age this great warrior had rapidly climbed to the position of General. But that was not enough for such an ambitious man. As the years passed he would eventually be crowned emperor of all Tamriel. Standing by his side from the very beginning, even before he was appointed General, were a handful of renowned and skilled Nord warriors, his personal Housecarl. These fearsome soldiers would help secure every victory credited to Talos. Leading his vanguard, even when the man himself was commanding the war efforts from the safety of the imperial capital.
  
With his Housecarl being a vital cog in the imperial war machine all of Tamriel was united under the dragon symbol.
  
As Talos ushered in the 3rd era, he commissioned some of the greatest smiths from across his new empire to forge sets of armor worthy of his loyal Housecarl. The Housecarl would wear these new armor sets with pride. But with all Tamriel united and no more enemys to fight, the legendary Housecarl would slowly be forgotten and their great deeds lost to the pages history.
  
When you live under the shadow of a man like Talos, who ascended to Godhood, that is only expected.
  
   
In current day skyrim, many Nords would disown the sacred imperial symbol of Akatosh embedded in the Housecarl's armor. But a true Nord and follower of Talos might wear it with pride. Not in support of the current weak empire, but instead wearing it to honor the great empire that Talos forged (with the help of his fellow Nords). A reminder for those imperials they face of the Nord who created their empire and they now disown. Even if only briefly, before a hammer comes crashing down on their skull.
