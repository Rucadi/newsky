[RedguardDiaspora](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/254553952)'s great armour mod [Viking Armor Collection](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/152651) brought into the Skyrim world. By the aid of [SkyPatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106659) we can give the Norse some love ;-)
  
Distributed outfits, shields and axes to a bunch of touch warriors. 
  
  
And some leveled lists too. So you can collect these by slaying villains :-) 
  
  
For even more viking inspired armours there is [Viking Armor Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/156646) created by RedguardDiaspora too. But published by [draqqable](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/14316094) ;-)
  
  
Unfortunately RedguardDiaspora has deleted his account. But his armors are still on Nexus. And elsewhere. You can check the posts section for the proper links ;-)
