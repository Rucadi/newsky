- Author: Clockwork Tot
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90684


Fully Craftable / Enchantable / Smeltable / Temperable - with SMP Skirt 
  
A delicate Cogs and Wire lace woven to make a brilliantly shiny Dwarven Heavy Armor
  
  
Update 1.1: Fixed Skirt sliders not being applied properly (Many Many Apologies!)
  
  
 Made with the CBBE (3BBB) 3BA body
  
Armor will require building in Bodyslide to fit nicely 
  
  
To Obtain:
  
Build at any Forge with Dwarven Ingots  - the Sword has a small extra craft requirement of a gem.
  
(hopefully this will not clog crafting stations)
