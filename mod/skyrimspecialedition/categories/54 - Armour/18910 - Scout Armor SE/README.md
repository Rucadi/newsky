**This mod adds a complete light armor and weapons set.**
  
  
All the armor pieces have dragonscale stats and are craftable at a forge under dragon item, weapons under steel.
  
You can enchant or improve all armor and weapons.
  
  
Unfortunately, there's no Helmet and Hooded helmet for Khajiit and Argonian 
  
so those are replaced by basic hoods.
  
  
This is a converted mod from Skyrim LE: Scout Armor by doodaboom

It was properly converted to Special Edition using the Creation Kit.
  
All meshes were run through NifOptimizer to ensure stability.
  
A check was performed with SSEedit for any "dirty edits", and none were found.
