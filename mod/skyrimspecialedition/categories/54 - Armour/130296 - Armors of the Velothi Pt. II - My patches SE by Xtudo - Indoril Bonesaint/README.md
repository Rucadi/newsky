**Optional files**
  

  
* **Fully optimized textures.** 4K, 2K and 1K versions available, including my new edits to them. 4K version is smaller than 2K because it has less optimized textures, as I only include edited files.
**My standalone version (only available for v1).** Only crafting, no NPC, world edits, scripts, etc. Requires one of the Main files installed first. It will replace Armors of the Velothi Pt2.esl. It requires a clean install, if you already have old mod installed. It also requires the original mod installed first.
  
* **RMB SPIDified - Armors of the Velothi Pt 2 compatible version (only available for v1) (My patches v1.6 are already fully compatible with RMB SPIDified v2.0.0.).** Requires one of the Main files installed first. It will replace Armors of the Velothi Pt2.esl.
