EBONY VALKYRIE
  
My patches by Xtudo****Description**
  
**My patches for the beautiful armor mod made by contentcat.**

  
* Added beast races support for the helmets.
New improved ground/inventory items.
  
* Changed extra items to clothing, to avoid bugs with the Matching Set perk.
Added "Warm" keyword for the Survival Mode.
  
* Added proper 1st person models.
Removed weapon adjust from extra items.
  
* Removed 1st person chest armor models from extra items.
Changed the no high heels boots to heavy armor sounds.
  
* Hidden long hair and ears from the helmet.
Concealed amulets.
  
* Optimized textures. 4K and 2K versions available. Original is 4K.
It will replace the original**EbonyValkyrie****.esp** ESPFE file. It's fine to install mid-game. You won't lose any already crafted item.
  
* It will work with any body type, 3BA, UBE, HIMBO, etc.

  
**Optional files**

  
* **Ebony Armor replacer**. **Boots**, **Heels** and **Heels 2** versions available, install only one. It only requires the original meshes and textures. But they are packed into BSA files. So I recommend you to also install one of my Main files first, which include optimized textures.
**Ebony Mail replacer.**Since the vanilla Ebony Mail is only a chest piece, I added crafting recipes for the rest of the pieces, like Ebony Mail Boots, Helmet, etc. In order to crafted, they require the **Ebony Smithing perk**, and that you already have the **Ebony Mail in your inventory**. The patch only requires the original meshes and textures. But they are packed into BSA files. So I recommend you to also install one of my Main files first, which include optimized textures. **Ebony Armor and Mail replacers can be used together, some overwriting is expected. Just install Ebony Mail replacer last.**
  
* **BHUNP Gloves fix.**Fixes missing body parts on the BHUNP Gloves. Noticeable when you're not wearing the main armor. Rebuild their BodySlide after installing. CBBE, HIMBO and UBE don't have this problem.
**Hair Non-HDT patch**.
  
* **Light Armor version.** Requires one of the Main files installed first, 2K or 4K. Advanced Armors crafting perk required.
