*Hiya, sweeties.*
  
*Uh*
  
*Yeah, this took a while, sorry.*

  
 
  
In 2020, I released a Skyrim armour overhaul mod Ancient Nord Armo(u)ry EXTREME LE/SE, a mod that splits the male and female Ancient Nord armours into respective unisex heavy and light variants, adds a shield, adds Nord Hero versions, modifies unique Ancient Nord armour pieces, and tweaks Nordic Ruin levelled list item distribution.
  
  
Since ANAE V1.1 in 2021, I was in the process of making ANAE V1.2 with new armours and some reworks. However, a combination of the influx of new ideas, the release of other mods to be consistent with, other Butane Boss pursuits, fluctuating modding interest, and that pesky thing we call life, saying that I took my time on this would be one hell of an understatement. This version ended up becoming a world of difference from ANAE V1.1 and the humble V1.2 it was intended to be, so this is v2.0 aka. ANAE:AE.
  
 
  

**New start, new year, new EXTREME...**
  
...and clearly, the time has come to get...

In this version, I have reworked the Heavy cuirasses. Instead of having the Medium Armor that no one would ever want to use, I have instead introduced a new tier system analogous to the Draugr enemy types (an optional module reverts this back to one set of heavy cuirass). The two light armour cuirasses from ANAE:LE/SE have been merged into one Light Armor set, based entirely on the vanilla female Ancient Nord Armor.
  
 
  
In addition to the armour pieces derived from the vanilla armours, I have added entirely new sets reminiscent of armours from The Elder Scrolls III: Bloodmoon: the **Ancient Skaalic Armor** (Nordic Mail Armor), the **Ancient Nord Ebony Armor** and the **Ancient Stalhrim Armor Set**, and each of these have their own Hero set (for transparency, Skaalic is a reskin of Ebony).
  
The Ancient Stalhrim and Ebony armours were made to compliment mods containing Ancient Nord Stalhrim and Ebony weapons (such as Ancient Nord Stalhrim and Haugbui). I do recognise that it is unfair to make all of you download another mod for a complete experience, so the Stalhrim and Ebony Module is there as an optional module.

**TECHNICAL AND COMPATIBILITY NOTES**Spoiler
  

  
* ***SAVE GAMES WITH ANAE:SE WILL BE INCOMPATIBLE WITH ANAE:AE***.
Although this is updated for the Anniversary Edition, the only AE Creation needed is the Fishing Creation. ***Fishing is free and I will not provide support for anyone who cannot be bothered to update their game.***
  
* All of the Ancient Nord sets are only crafted at the Skyforge. The exception to this is the Ancient Skaalic Armor, which is only crafted at the Skaal Village forge. With the Stalhrim and Ebony Module, the Ebony and Stalhrim armours can also be crafted this way in addition to the Skyforge.
All of the Nord Hero sets are only crafted at the Skyforge after its purification at the end of The Companions questline. The exception to this is the Skaalic Hero Armor, which is only crafted at the Skaal Village forge after saving Solstheim from Miraak. With the Stalhrim and Ebony Module, the Ebony and Stalhrim armours can also be crafted this way in addition to the Skyforge post-purification.
  
* All armour pieces (except Nord Hero pieces) can also be found in the Nordic Ruins. Ancient Skaalic Armor pieces can only be found on Solstheim.
**Any patch previously made for ANAE:SE is incompatible with ANAE:AE due to the change-arounds of FormIDs.** Please make a new one for whatever mod you have.
  
* With the heavy armour tier system, an Ancient Nord Warrior Armor can be used to craft into Ancient Nord Guardian Armor, and likewise, Guardian into Lord. From this, Lord Armour can be converted into Nord Hero Heavy Armor. Enabling the Vanilla Heavy Module removes the Warrior and Guardian Armors, and the Lord Armor is renamed the Ancient Nord Heavy armor. Helmet variants remain untouched.
**Assume that EVERY nif file for an Ancient Nord Armour piece is altered.** Please check if you have any mesh replacers that conflict with this mod.
  
* Any unique textures made for this mod are based on vanilla textures. You are free to make your own 4K/aMidianBorn-styled textures but don’t expect me to make them.
This mod does not affect the armours on the Draugr enemies, nor does this mod let you take the armour off from a Draugr’s corpse.
  
* The greatsword Everscorch overwrites the cell record of the enchanted greatsword which holds the Ancient Helm of the Unburned. Please check your modlist in case there is a conflict.
The enchantments of Kyne’s Token, Ancient Helmet of the Unburned and the Helm of Yngol have been buffed.
  
* New injected keywords have been introduced for all armours and Nord Hero weapons. Injected perks have been added to ensure the new keywords work with the vanilla smithing perks, Matching Set Bonuses, and Frost-Enchanted Stalhrim (+10% bonus on Ancient Stalhrim). The keywords and perks are injected so as to be cross-compatible with my upcoming sister mod, a proxy levelled list distribution mod. With these quest-initialised perks, players get bonuses to Nord Hero smithing improvements (+25%), enchantments to Nord Hero Ebony (+10%), and Frost-enchantments to Stalhrim Hero (+30%).
The Ancient Nord Amulet has been given its own blank skin while Kyne's Token has its own Kyne carved skin. The amulet has been given a crafting recipe.
  
* Aela the Huntress’ outfit and class have been altered, so she wears her familiar huntress attire, while being proficient in the light armour skill (to counteract the USKP change).
Fanari Strong-Voice wears the Ancient Skaalic Armor, as her distant predecessor does in TESIII: Bloodmoon.
  
* The brave Heroes of Sovngarde (and Ysgramor) wear the Nord Hero armours and wield Nord Hero weapons.
Please understand that although I did my best on the weight painting, some armours may clip.
  
* CC Survival Keywords have appropriately been added armour pieces.
Added support for COCKS and the aforementioned sister mod. 
  
* To improve consistency with other mods, Ancient Nord and Nord Hero items have stats and crafting recipes same as or akin to vanilla. To counterbalance, the use of ANAE’s keywords allows Nord Hero items to be improved much more.
Your preferred acronymed b\*\*b/p\*nis skeleton mod would most likely be incompatible with ANAE:AE. 
  
* Please understand that I make patches for mods that I play. If you want to patch for this mod, go right ahead!

**Compared with ANAE:SE:**
  

  
* ﻿﻿Completely retired support for Frostfall, WACCF, CCOR (the latter two are just too much work to make patches for, sorry)
Merged ANAE:SE’s Huntress and Light armours into one armour set.
  
* ANAE:SE’s Lord Armor has been renamed the Ancient Nord Housecarl Armor
﻿Removed the Ancient Nord Medium Armor and its Hero counterpart (let's face it, you weren't using it anyway)
