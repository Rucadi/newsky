# Iron Battlemage Armor - CBBE 3BA - HIMBO
- Author: Imp

﻿A new set of heavy armor made for the aspiring Battlemage.
  
  
Armor stats are slightly better than Iron Banded armor. 
  
  
Craftable with the usual iron armor materials:
  
Corundum Ingot
  
Iron Ingot
  
Leather and Leather Strips
  
  
If you have SPID installed, enchanted armor variants have a chance to be found on Bandit mages.
  
  
The shirt underneath the armor will use whatever College Robes texture you have!
  
  
  
If you're a fan of my Skimped mods, this mod is no different! Plenty of zaps for the armor can be found in Bodyslide. *(male included!)*
  
**Because this is a mash up of Creation Club armors, while the .esls are not required, the textures from those two mods are required.**
