Reworked the completely pointless Ring of Namira, It is more worth going to devour corpses for powerful power.
  
（This mod is ESL Flag, no need to take precious ESP slot)
  
  
  
• Main changes
  
Item value increased
  
Improved Devour Corpses conditions
  
Now you can Devour Corpses that are flesh and blood creatures (humans, animals, etc.), but you cannot devour Corpses that are machines, dragons, Daedra, or undead. And for vampires, Devour is equivalent to feeding blood once.
  
Devour corpse can obtain 5 Corpse essence, which can be used to release additional skills.
  
  
To Devour a corpse, you need to sneak and hold still, because the cannibalism event is hardcoded to not play the cannibalism animation while sneaking, so Dar plays another animation and then replaces it with the cannibalism animation.
  
  
Enchantment Changes
  
Unlocks the ability to Devour Corpses, increasing disease and poison resistance by <100%>, increasing stamina by <100>, and stamina regeneration by <50%>. Devour Corpses restores <50%> of your health, magicka, and stamina, and increases health and stamina by <5> points, and regeneration by <5%> for <6> hours, stackable, and allows you to store corpse essence in your ring. Already consumed <X> corpse essence. Maximum of <100> corpse essences can be stored.
