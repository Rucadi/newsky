Forsworn Headdress Variants
  

  
* Contains 7 new headdresses/helmets, 8 rare versions and 1 non-lootable headdress. Rare versions can be looted reliably from forsworn briarheart.
Also changed "Chance None" in the helmet leveled list from 50 to 20. This makes it 20% instead of 50% that forsworns will spawn without a headress/helmet.
  
* The blindfold version of black feathered headdress is currently only for human races. Argonian and khajiit equip without blindfold, sorry.
Currently only in leveled lists, no crafting. Can be tempered but not double improved unless some smithing perk mod is installed.
  
* The only exception is the feather headdress which can only be crafted if you have a certain forsworn headdress. This was omitted from the leveled list as it did not match up well with the hairstyles that forsworns sometimes have.
This plugin edits LItemForswornHelmet50 [LVLI:000647B2].
  
* And SkinBriarHeart [OTFT:0007EABC].

  
Forsworn Armor Variants
  

  
* Contains 4 (+1) Forsworn Light Armor and 2 Forsworn Fur Armor. One Forsworn Light Armor only differs in feather color.
The Chance None value for the Forsworn Gauntlets leveled list has been changed from 50 to 33. (LItemForswornGauntlets50 [LVLI:000647B0])
  
* Currently only in leveled lists, no crafting. Can be tempered but not double improved unless some smithing perk mod is installed.
For vanilla body. No custom texture. It would be great if someone could do some body slides or conversions.
  
* This plugin edits LItemForswornCuirass [LVLI:00043BCE], LItemForswornBoots [LVLI:00043BD4] and LItemForswornGauntlets50 [LVLI:000647B0].
And ArmorBriarHeart [ARMO:0005D008], ArmorBriarHeartEmpty [ARMO:0005D009], BriarHeartAA [ARMA:0005D00C], BriarHeartEmptyAA [ARMA:0005D00D]. These are non-playable "skins" for Forsworn Briarheart. It also fixes the weight slider and changes it so that it is treated as light armor instead of clothing.
  

  
Feel free to share your ideas if you want, but I don't take requests. I already have plans for this mod, so I'm not actively seeking your ideas.
  
  
To Do:
  
SpoilerAdd more variants for headdress and armor. Heavy or light bone armor is expected.
  
Add some hoodless versions.
  
~~Add variants for gaundlets and boots.~~
  
~~Add glowing spriggan masks.~~
  
Adjust some inventory models.
  
Create an optional file using the bone mask from Goblin CC.
  
Create craftable patches and upload them to optional files.
  
Support non-vanilla bodies, use SPID or something to make armor distribution compatible, but these are not priority. I don't mind if someone else does it.
  
Minor Known Issues:
  
SpoilerI fixed some issues with the forsworn briarheart armor, but not the gap in their skin color, as I felt it would be redundant to try to fix this in this mod. (I fixed the armor min/max weights, gaps in the ankles and torso bone weights.)
  
The blindfold version of black feathered headdress is currently only for human races. Argonian and khajiit equip without blindfold, sorry.
  
  
My mods, recommended for you.
