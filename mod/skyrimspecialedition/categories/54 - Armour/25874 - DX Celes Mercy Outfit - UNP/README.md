You can find the outfit with the bow in Riften inside the [Temple of Mara](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/4482/4482-1558256892-490276741.png)﻿.
  
It's at the basement in its own place of worship. :)

[i][font=Times New Roman][i][font=Times New Roman]A new light elven outfit inspired from Overwatch's Mercy character with a unique bow and arrows.[/font]*[/font][/i]
  
*[font=Times New Roman]
  
  
  
[/font]*The outfit has similar stats to light elven armor but it's a bit stronger and lighter.
  
The bow adds holy damage over time to enemies and more so to the undead.
  
It's a bit faster and stronger compared to a normal elven bow.
  
The arrows can be crafted at any forge under elven category
  
and they glow and illuminate the area of impact.
  
  
The bow and arrows can be used by both female and male
  
characters in case you just want to use the bow.

Been playing Overwatch on and off for some time now and I really like Mercy's
  
Halloween skin, since I'm never going to actually get it in Overwatch I decided
  
the best course of action would be to make a similar one for Skyrim to at least
  
have some fun with it in another game and also share it of course with you guys!
  
  
The lootbox business is just a joke but I had to stay true to the whole Overwatch spirit. :)

The inspiration for this and most of my outfit mods came from [Minidresses Collection mod by Tiwa44](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/47376/) who did an
  
awesome job converting some of the long dresses to mini versions.
