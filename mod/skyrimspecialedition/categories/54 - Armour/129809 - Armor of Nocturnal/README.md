This mod adds a standalone light armor set inspired by Dark Fantasy.
  
  
The armor all share almost the exact same stats as vanilla Dwarven and recipes as Ebony armor, which means you craft them at a forge under the Ebony section! (Or use console commands/[AddItemMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17563))
  
  
Armor in game is named ''Nocturnal's [Armor Piece]''.
