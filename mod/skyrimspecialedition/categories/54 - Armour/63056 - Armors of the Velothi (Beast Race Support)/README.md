# Armors of the Velothi (Beast Race Support)

This reshapes most of the helmets offered by this mod so that they fit the Argonian and Khajiit races--without changing the originals, so they still fit everyone else as before. They are shaped off of the default argonian and khajiit heads.
  
  
This mod requires Pulcharmsolis' original to be installed prior. It will not work properly without it. NOTE: This mod must be loaded in addition to--and after--the original or it will not work.
  
  
Please let me know if anything added doesn't work correctly and I'll fix it as soon as I can.
