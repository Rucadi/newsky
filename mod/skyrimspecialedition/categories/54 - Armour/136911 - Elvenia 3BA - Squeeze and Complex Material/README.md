It is requirement for this mod, basically this is a patch for it.
  
  
All previews use [Complex Armory](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/129231?tab=description) and [2x diffuse upscale](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/133492) for it.
  
  
**What this mod does:**
  
  
- Adds realistic bone weighting to the top.
  
 -> Optional Squeeze sliders for top and bottom.
  
 -> Optional Dynamic Cubemap.
  
 -> Optional [Complex Armory](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/129231?tab=description) (Complex Material) support.

**So there is three main versions (patches) to pick:**(Pick just one)
  
  
**1.) Elvenia Squeeze**
  
 -> Adds realistic bone weighting to the top.
  
 -> Adds version of the top that has squeeze sliders.
  
**2.) Elvenia Dynamic Squeeze**
  
 -> Same as 1, but replaces the unique cubemap with a dynamic one.
  
    -> Requires [Community shaders](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86492), or ENB set up to use Dynamic cubemaps
  
  
**3.) Elvenia Complex Squeeze**
  
 -> Same as 2, but meshes (models) have been adjusted for [Complex Armory](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/129231?tab=description) (pre 4.0) Complex Material (elven) textures.
  
   -> Requires [Community shaders](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86492), or ENB set up to use Dynamic cubemaps, and Complex Material.
  
   -> Also requires at least Elven textures installed from [Complex Armory](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/129231?tab=description).
  
(This version used in the previews)

Basic Installation:**
  
**All versions:**
  
  
1.) Install: [Elvenia Armor - CBBE 3BA with SMP Earrings](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90194?tab=description)﻿, and it's requirements.
  
2.) Install this mod, overwrite everything (load after)
  
3.) (Optional files) Install optional pulsating glow files if you wish (load after)
  
4.) Build in Bodyslide (more on this below)
  
5.) Done.
  
**Building in Bodyslide:**
  
  
1.) Batch build first, just search "Elvenia".
  
  
2.) Optional next step, build top with squeezes:
  
  
- Select *Elvenia CBBE 3BA - Body kp84\_squeeze*
  
 -> Adjust the extra sliders for your body type, and build.
  
  
- Some tips for building it:
  
-> Press T in preview window to hide textures, press W to enable wireframe.
  
-> Adjust sliders for BOTH weight 0, and 100
  
-> You can go above 100 value, or even negative value for a slider, if you type it in.
  
-> You can build while in-game. Adjust the sliders, build, re-equip in-game, you will see new results.
  
-> DO NOT batch build over it after building it, or you will lose your changes.
  
  
GIF below (Different top than in this mod, but principle is the same)
  
Spoiler
  
Glorious 5 fps gif, just to show me adjusting the sliders for 100 weight, then moving to zero weight, stopped recording there due to the lenght of the gif.

Done.
  
  
Some extra rambling:
  
  
- Arrows, and quiver aren't covered by Complex Armory, so they will use the weapon textures you have installed.
  
   --> Dynamic cubemaps will still be applied for versions 2 and 3.
  
- Bow uses a mix of bow and armor textures.
  
   --> Dynamic cubemaps will still be applied for versions 2 and 3.
  
   --> Version 3 some parts will use complex material for the bow.
  
  
- Version 2 and 3, end result look will be detemined by your settings, stuff you have installed, etc.
  
   --> Specially version 2, depending which texture replacer you have installed, and its [env\_map texture](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/6392) (article link).
  
  
- Dark Elven texture from Complex Armory for version 3 will work too (will add prew pic later).
  
  
- Hair in previews [Vanilla hair remake](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63979?tab=description).
