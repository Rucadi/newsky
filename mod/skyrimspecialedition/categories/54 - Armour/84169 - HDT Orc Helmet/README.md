**Disclaimer:**

***(This disclaimer is here to set expectations - like most, modding is something I do for free and for fun, not everyone seems to keep that in mind.)**Hi everyone, and thanks for your interest in my mod!
  
  
I've been part of the modding community since the early ’90s and a TES fan since Morrowind. I create mods first and foremost for myself—to suit my own tastes, playstyle, and ideas. I don’t build around what I think “the masses” might want, and I’m absolutely not aiming to please people.
  
  
I do not make mods for money, public approval, or download counts. This is a labor of love and a passion I’ve had for many years. I update and amend things in my own way, on my own time, and in my own space.
  
  
As a result, When I share my work publicly you’re essentially getting a look at my vision. Feedback is always welcome if it’s constructive and polite, but I’m under no obligation to update, rework, or change my mods to match someone else’s expectations. I maintain them in my own way, for my own reasons.
  
  
Most of my earlier mods were never intended for release, so they may lack polish or features.***

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
Quite simple, adds HDT to the tassle/plume on the orc armor helmet. no fuss or nonsense.
  
  
works for both beast races and humans.
  
  
obviously will require HDT.
  
  
The armor in the video is not included. It's a modified variant of Orc armor which i've added fur to for khajiits.
