This plugin has been created with the most recent version of the creation kit, if you are on a game version earlier than 1.6.1130 I recommend you use [BEES](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441) otherwise your game can crash, wont start or the mod wont be loaded. If you dont wanna use that mod you have to set the version of the .esp in SSEdit from 1.71 to 1.70.
  
  
Install using your favourite mod manager.
  
  
Optional **Complex Material** support.
  
Requirements: ENB
  
Set EnableComplexMaterial=true and EnableDynamicCubemap=true.
  
If these are greyed out in your ingame ENB control panel you have to set them manually in your enbseries.ini located in your Skyrim folder.
  
  
Optional **PBR** support.
  
Requirements: [Community Shaders](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86492).
  
  
Safe to install mid-save.
  
  
Default texture resolution is 4k, higher resolutions are found under optional files.
