[font=Verdana]Templar Assassin is a new quality armor for female characters with high modularity. It supports 3BA, BHUNP, CBBE and UNP bodies and has a light armor class. To be even more specific, it takes leather armor as a base. The CBBE and UNP versions are also fine for those who don't want jiggling physics when using 3BA and BHUNP. BodySlides are not included in the main files, they must be downloaded separately from the Miscellaneous section. This mod also includes a new sword and dagger weapon set. All this beauty can be crafted at Skyforge or obtained through ESP explorer.
  
  
Since the armor doesn't have a helmet, I gave that role to another piece of armor in order for the light armor perks to work. A more detailed description of the component parts and their slots can be found just below.

The basic version of the armor is divided into two types: with gloves and without gloves. In addition to having complementary color schemes, both versions have their own features.
  
  
Gloveless version: has cuirass and boot flags, as the boots are not removable
  
Gloved version: uses cuirass, boot and gauntlets flags
  
  

**You can also additionally put on a character:**
  
Armlets - 34 forearms slot (marked as gauntlents)
  
Belt - 52 slot
  
Belt Acc - 53 slot
  
Poison Belt - 52 slot
  
Bag for poison belt - 53 slot
  
Shoulder Armor - 59 slot (marked as helmet. Yes)

Yes, belts replace each other and additional items are not suitable for mutual use on two belts. No one is stopping you from mixing them however you want, tho. My job is to warn you about some... mismatches.[/left]

[font=Verdana][size=3]Q: **Can I use this mod with Vanilla body?**
  
A: There is no perfect adaptation for it, but you can use the gloved CBBE or UNP version with vanilla body, because the armor has no open parts, it completely covers the body. 
  
  
Q: **Can I make a conversion for [BodySlide-name] or [Body-name]?**
  
A: Yup, it's just that your patch should require mandatory installation of the original mod and contain only the modified files.
  
  
Q: **Can I make a [patch-name]/[addon-name] for the armor?**
  
A: Yup, all terms and conditions stated above.
  
  
Q: **What is the name of the preset/hair in the screenshot?**
  
A: Which one? The author is indicated under each screenshot. Please specify the screenshot number and the author's name at once in questions like this. If the author reads comments and considers it necessary, they will answer your question about the preset or other modifications used. I can't help you here.[/font][font=Verdana]
  
  
Q: **More colors?**
  
A: Make 'em yourself  ![](https://i.imgur.com/i7aMYYU.png)
  
  
Q: **I don't like this, can you redo that?**
