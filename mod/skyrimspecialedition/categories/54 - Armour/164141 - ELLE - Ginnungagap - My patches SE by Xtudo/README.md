My patches by Xtudo****Description**
  
**My patches and tweaks for the beautiful armor mod made by Ellxe.**
  
  
**Tweaks and edits**It will replace **[ELLE] Ginnungagap.esp**. It's fine to update mid-game, you won't lose any already crafted item.

  
* Added **Light Armored** and **Clothing** versions of all items.
Added **proper 1st person** models.
  
* Added **beast races support** (Argonian, Khajiit and Orcs) to the masks.
New**Non High Heels Boots.** They work like an extra equippable item, that will conceal the high heels. They use the body slot 48.
  
* Improved ground/inventory models.
Removed VendorItemAnimalHide keyword from the heavy set.
  
* Added ArmorMaterialEbony to the original heavy set.
Added missing footstep sounds to the armors.
  
* Removed weapon adjust from the masks.
Removed 1st person models from the masks.
  
* The Masks are now clothing, to avoid problems/bugs with the Matching Set and Custom Fit perks.
Changed required Advanced Armors crafting perk to Ebony Smithing perk of the heavy armor set.
  
* Optimized and added proper mipmaps to all texture files.
Concealed amulets.
  
* Added Warm keyword to armored items, for the Survival Mode.
Improved crafting recipes.
  
* Edited names for a more lore-friendly feel.
Reduced armor values from the heavy armor set, it was insanely high.
  
* Increased weight and price of the heavy armor set.
**You can craft all at any forge. Ebony Smithing** and **Advanced Armors** perks required for the armored items.
  

  
**Optional files**
  

  
* **2K** (original size) and**1K** optimized textures.
**Heels Sounds patch.** It will work with any version.
  
* **CBBE and UNP versions**. No high heel boots merged with the main armors/outfits.
