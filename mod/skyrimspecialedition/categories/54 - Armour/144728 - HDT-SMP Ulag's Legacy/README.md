Enhance your Ulag’s Legacy experience with realistic clothing physics! This mod brings lifelike movement to the Apotheus Light Armor, Blooded Heavy Armor, and Duskward Light Armor using the HDT-SMP framework. Watch as your armor flows and reacts naturally to your character’s movements, adding a new level of immersion to Guitun Scarfin’s meticulously crafted designs.
  
  
Furthermore, this mod includes several fixes to enhance your experience. I have corrected typos in the names of items and addressed some issues with the ground objects.
  
  
HIMBO and CBBE 3BA users can find bodyslide conversions in the optional files. 3BA conversion includes the ever-so essential jiggle physics.
  
  
Ulag's Legacy is one of my favorite armor mods, and it is one of the reasons I learned the HDT-SMP workflow.
  
I was particularly fond of the Blooded set, but there were no HDT patches available for it. This was quite frustrating, so I decided to create one myself. That was a year ago. Since then, I have gained a lot of experience with HDT-SMP. Now is the time to return to where it all started!

Guitun Scarfin - for the original mod.
  
I had to learn this stuff from someone.
  
Helxas - for his youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oq3xU3fRf54&t=1s), which taught me the basics.
  
fuse00, Pulcharmsolis, tatururutia - for great examples of high quality cloth physics as well as some of the xml configurations.
  
Everglaid - for their [accessories](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/112481) mod. It introduced me to the concept of proxy shapes.
