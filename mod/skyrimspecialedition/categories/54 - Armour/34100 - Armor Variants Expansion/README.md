Armor Variants Expansion aims to adjust and increase variety of armors on Skyrim, by adding new variants of vanilla armors to the leveled lists trying to be extremely lore friendly. **This is not a[size=4][b][u] model**  replacer mod[/u][/b], but it enhances variety of the armors found in Skyrim.
  
  
All variants include models for both genders & all races, enchantments, crafting and upgrade recipes, world locations and leveled list entries so NPCs will have a good chance of using these.
  
  
  
More in details; at the moment following new variants are complete and integrated for:[/size]
  
  
-Iron (helmet, cuirass, a heavy tower shield and a wooden one in light category for the hide variant).
  
  
-Steel (two horned helmets, one simple, two armors with one new padded variant and a rounded shield).
  
  
-Dwemer (helmet and cuirass).
  
  
-Leather (helmet and cuirass).
  
**Version 1.5:**
  
  
-Hide (helmet and two cuirasses).
  
  
-Elven (one winged helmet with the same values of the gilded one, and one gilded cuirass).
  
  
-Orcish (one crested helmet for the moment).
  
  
-Studded (one cuirass).
  
  
[size=3]**Version 2.0:**
  
  
-Ebony (helmet, cuirass and a tower shield).
  
  
-Dragonscale (closed helmet and cuirass).
  
  
-Dragonbone (helmet and cuirass).
  
  
-Daedric (helmet, cuirass and a tower shield).
  
[/size]
  
  
Plus it adds two new almost endgame sets used by common high level hostile NPCs such as bandits. There stats are comparable to the Nordic Carved set and the Glass set:
  
  
-Improved Steel Plate set (one helmet, one cuirass and gauntlets). This set is equiparable/similar to the Ebony set, so it will be craftable and upgradable with the Ebony Smithing perk.
  
  
-Improved Scaled set (helmet and cuirass). This set is equiparable/similar to the Glass set, so it will be craftable and upgradable with the Glass Smithing perk.

[color=#ffffff]In addition with the 1.5 release there is a new middle armor rate set, the Nordic Vanguard set, comparable in a level between the regular Scale set and the Elven Gilded set.
  
It's an alternative for those who don't like the often seen elven set.[/color]
  
  
-Nordic Vanguard set (helmet, cuirass and shield). As said before, it could be an alternative for the player who don't like the overuse of the elven set; craftable and upgradable with Elven Smithing perk.
  
It's uncommon, so don't expect to see it around the world, apart from some sporadic hostile npc.

[size=3]
  
Every retexture mod that you want, it's totally compatible with any of them; although some of these could clash aesthetically with the some of these models.
  
  
Personally, I highly suggest to use the CaBaL masterpiece [aMidianBorn Book of Silence SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35382).
  
  
[/size][size=3]Also, take a look at the growing [patch collection](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35176) for Armor Variants Expansion.
  
There you can find patches for Morrowloot Ultimate, OBIS, Cutting Room Floor, Summermyst and many more.[font=Times New Roman]**Future plans:**[/font]
  
  
No one for now.

For update just overwrite the old files.
  
**Uninstalling the mod at mid-game is not recommended; start a new game after uninstalling. This is recommended due to the [size=5][b][color=#cc0000][u][size=4][size=5][b][color=#cc0000][u][size=4][size=5][b][color=#cc0000][u][size=4]applied**[/size] leveled lists[/size][/u][/color][/b][/size][/size][/u][/color][/b][/size] modifications.[/size][/u][/color][/b] **Removing the mod during a playthrough is the sole responsibility of the user.****Use a save game file without this mod applied as backup if it's necessary to rollback.**[/size]
