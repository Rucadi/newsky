*See the picture for specific bodyshape changes.*
  
  
Adding weight 0 to weight 100 vanilla bodyshape change support.(This will be supported on all my physical patches, just need some time.)
  
Now you can change the body weight, and the size of armor will also change.
  
Support vanilla body, no need for any MOD bodyshape.
  
  
**Only some meshes files.
  
Require original mod and HDT-SMP Falconer Armor Patch.
  
Then use this to completely cover [b]it**.

[/size]This patch adds hdt-SMP cloth physics to the Falconer Armor (hair, cape and skirt).
  
Require original mod.
  
Then use this physical patch to completely cover it.
  
Also require HDT-SMP (Skinned Mesh Physics) OR FSMP - Faster HDT-SMP.

To be honest, every time someone said in the comment that he lost a lot of frames when using my physical patches, I was very tired.
  
I play Skyrim with a Lenovo Y7000P purchased in 2018, which graphics card is 1060.
  
When I make every physical patch, I always try my best to reduce the loss of physical effects on FPS.
  
If you can't accept it, you can choose never to use them.
  
I don't give a damn.

Or if you have other armor you like, you can also entrust me to make physical patch.[/size]**
