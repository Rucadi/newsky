If for any reason you can't find the [crafting manual](http://static-3.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/69138-0-1441596606.jpg) download [AddItemMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17563)﻿ and add any items you like manually.
  
  
If you plan to use only the male armor it doesn't matter what female body type if any you have installed.
  
  
For the recipes to appear in the crafting interface you need to have the Daedric smithing perk and the [crafting manual](http://static-3.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/69138-0-1441596606.jpg) in your inventory! The recipes will appear gradually with every piece of armor you craft and carry on you. The simple crafting version doesn't require any perks. You only need the [crafting manual](http://static-3.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/69138-0-1441596606.jpg) in your inventory and you can find all the items under the Daedric category.

This is the sixteenth armor of a series of  mini armors and outfits. 
  
This one was a lot more complicated and demanding since for the first time I designed a male version as well.
  
Also for the first time ever I spent significant time to figure out how exactly the texturing of metals works.
  
I hope you enjoy it! :)
  
  
The idea of this series originated from Minidresses Collection mod by Tiwa44 who is doing an awesome job converting some of the long dresses to mini versions. The idea for this particular armor came from Tiwa44 as well. He continues his amazing work by converting the vanilla armors to mini versions. Check his mods out if you haven't already, they're pretty awesome! :)
