• Dark Teeth: Transform into a dark, displaying the dark Teeth of Boethiah and dash forward, triggering a dark explosion, causing <30> points of dark damage to enemies <10> yards, and causing <80> points of darkness damage to targets in contact and knocking down or Stagger the target.

• Dark Mist: Transforms itself into a cloud of Dark mist, increasing movement speed by <200%>, and after a short delay releases a cloud of dark mist with a <50> yard range, instantly making the enemy target lose its target, increasing damage taken by <50%>, and limiting its movement for <10> seconds. Cooldown time <150> seconds. (Can only be used in Sneaking)

• Dark Shape : Summons a dark Shape in ebony mail wherever it is in sight. The phantom quickly rushes into the enemy and destroys itself in a few seconds, causing a <50> yard Dark Maelstrom explosion, while pulling enemies affected by the explosion closer and restricting the affected target's movement for <10> seconds. Cooldown time <200> seconds.
  
  
  
(The cooldown effect of all skills is universal. If the cooldown effect of a skill has not ended, all skills cannot be used.)
  
  
  
  
New Boethiah full set of armor, I'm tired of just one piece of armor, why not a full set.
  
  
Added SMP Dark Cloak to Boethiah's Ebony Mail.
  
A three-piece set of gauntlets, boots, and helmet has been added. Except for the unique model of the helmet, the others are all vanilla ebony armor.
  
  
When you have the Ebony Bsmithing Perk, and have Ebony Chainmail, Can crafting the remaining three pieces of armor at the Skyforge. Equipping a full set of Boethiah's Ebony Armor reduces physical damage taken by an additional 20%.
  
Boethiah's Ebony Armor series is stronger and lighter than regular Ebony Armor, such is the power of Daedric artifacts.
