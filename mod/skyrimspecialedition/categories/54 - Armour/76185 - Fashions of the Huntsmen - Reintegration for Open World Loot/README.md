Fashions of the Huntsmen are distributed using vanilla outfit records. This way if NPC has leather outfit assigned, they will use one randomly. It works just fine, but you could argue that certain NPCs shouldn't wear specific armor sets.
  
I do not claim that my version is better, it's simply different, but if you are bothered by nords casually using orcish leather sets you are in the right place. It also patches it for OWL since default mod is not compatible with it (it overrides OWL changes).
  
  
Outfits have been separated into two categories: common and rare. Crafting recipes not affected. [size=3]Forwards USSEP changes but does not require it.
  
  
Common:
  
Distributed with OWL leveled lists, anyone can use them, will be sold by vendors as any other vanilla armor.
  
**Atmoran** - you can just assume it's another nordic leather armor.
  
**Cyrodiilic** - due to imperial influence it makes sense for it to be common.
  
**Bretonic** - High Rock borders with Skyrim, let's assume it's also common.
  
  
Rare:
  
You won't find them so easily, distributed with very specific set of rules.
  
**Altmeri** - sold by vendors (low chance), worn by one dead body (couldn't find any Altmer that has leather armor in vanilla).
  
**Colonial Militia** - my personal vision, I'm not sure how to distribute this armor so I changed the name to **Cyrodiilic Militia**, it's sold in Radiant Raiment (one set, 100% chance).
  
**Fletcher** - my personal vision, name changed to **Hunter's Set**, used by hunters (66%), sold by vendors (medium chance).
  
**Khajiiti** - worn by some Khajiits, sold by all 3 caravans (two sets per caravan, 100% chance), sold by vendors (low chance).
  
**Orcish** - worn by Tribal Orcs, sold by Tribal Orc vendors (100% chance), sold by vendors (very low chance).
  
**Valenwood** - sold by vendors (low chance), sold in Drunken Huntsman (100% chance), worn by one dead body (couldn't find suitable Bosmer that wears leather armor in vanilla game).
  
  
Vendor probabilities of each rare armor - Fletcher (Hunter) > Altmeri > Bosmeri = Khajiiti > Orcish. Can't give exact number since it depends on size of certain leveled lists which may vary depending on load ordrer, but I aimed at 50%, 20%, 10%, 10%, 5%.
  
  
Vanilla leveled lists version will not be provided since they are hard to work with, OWL is nice and clean and tidy.
  
  
And if someone asks why does it contain cell and worldspace edits - because there are two Orc Strongholds which are basically bandit camps. They are filled with orc bandits. Game uses default bandit template, if I change it, I will give all orc bandits orcish leather armor. So I had to copy existing leveled npc, assign him new armor and OWL inventory pattern, set them to use vanilla template except the inventory, and change NPC spawn points to use new NPCs. This way everything is consistent without even breaking NPC facegen (since facegen comes from template which is unchanged). Just load it before stuff like Lux and you will be fine. Only one cell and three worldspace grids affected.
