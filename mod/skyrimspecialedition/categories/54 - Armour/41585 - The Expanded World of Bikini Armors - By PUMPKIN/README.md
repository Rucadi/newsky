[font=Comic Sans MS]So this Project started because [/font]**IT'S BEEN EIGHTY-FOUR YEARS**[font=Comic Sans MS] (jk but that's how long it felt like) since [TAWOBA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/83383) first came out and then [ported to CBBE in SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9547)﻿, and since then, there were no new updates on Bikini Armors because just like The Avatar himself, our Lord and God Nisetanaka, vanished when we needed him the most.
  
 ﻿However, all is not lost because SunJeong remastered TAWOBA as **TAWOBA Remastered** on her WixSite Page, which not only improved over the default TAWOBA as well as the SSE Version, but also merged the whole set with Nisetanaka's long lost Bikini Ascend Vol 1 alongside Nordic Carved Bikini by Halofarm. This gives me an idea to complete the whole Bikini Armors by adding Bikini Armors to every Smithing Perks, hence starts the Project: **TEWOBA - The Expanded World of Bikini Armors**, and now, here we are.[/font]

[font=Comic Sans MS]aside from the bikini sets above, there are also additional parts for existing Bikini sets, like an additional breastplate or additional boots etc etc, you can discover them yourselves.[/font]

[font=Comic Sans MS]There are 3 Main Requirements for this:
  
1. [CBBE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/198) by ousnius.
  
2. [TAWOBA Remastered](https://sunkeumjeong.wixsite.com/mysite/post/the-amazing-world-of-bikini-armors-remastered) by SunJeong.
  
3. [RaceMenu High Heels](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18045) by ousnius.
  
  
and Depending on your Physics Mode, you might want to use some of these
  
1. [CBPC](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21224) by Shizof
  
2. [HDT-SMP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30872) by aers
  
3. [CBBE SMP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29023) by ousnius
  
4. [CBBE 3BBB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30174) by Acro748
  
  
[/font][font=Comic Sans MS]Install everything above, build the Bodyslide, and there you have it, all done. Complete the necessary requirements and craft them sets. Or if you're feeling lazy you can just [AddItemMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17563) these sets, the choice is all yours.[/font]

[font=Comic Sans MS]So in v1.03 I did an attempt at making CBBE, CBBE Physics Version as well as tweaking and updating (almost) every sliders in 3BA Version to the latest version, and not to mention pack all of them in FOMOD.
  
Since there's a lot of things that me, Murphie and DDCrusader did in v1.03, I do expect some inconsistencies occur on v1.03, PLEASE POST THEM ISSUES and let me know, because that will be something to do for v1.04.

[font=Comic Sans MS]Q: Wait where are the FAQs at?
  
A: Moved to Comments Tab for Convenience so that people doesn't have to scroll down a ton just to read the FAQs.
  
[/font]

[font=Comic Sans MS]Pretty much that.[/font]

[font=Comic Sans MS]There's really nothing much to said, however I do notice that there are also people that talks smack about people liking fantasy bikini outfits and calling them UNIMMERSIVE and NON LORE FRIENDLY; gotta admit I was one of those people as well. Thing is, The Elder Scrolls itself has always been open about sexuality and some nudity, heck even some of the nudity depicted in old Elder Scrolls games are even considered explicit, (e.g. Azura having a bare breast on Elder Scrolls 2 Daggerfall.) and this in it on itself was also the vision in which Julian LeFay, the father of The Elder Scrolls Series envisioned it. So for me, it is still immersive to create and share such skimpy sets. Not to mention this is 2020 people, there are also skimpy sets for male as well, I think SavrenX used such sets for their Screenshots [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32667).
  
 ﻿All in all, don't let anyone else dictate how you have to enjoy your experience with Skyrim; to each their own, this is the lesson I learned when delving into this topic a year ago. Not only that, this is a freakin' Mod for the love of Papa Akatosh, you don't like it you can skip it; if you like it, there you go! That is all, I want to apologize beforehand if any of what I said upsets certain groups or not and I hope what I said didn't sound patronizing in any way.[/font]
