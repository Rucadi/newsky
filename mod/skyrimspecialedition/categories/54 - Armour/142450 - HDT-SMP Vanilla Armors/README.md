Utilizing the HDT-SMP framework, this mod revamps the physics behavior of most armor sets in the game. Experience truly realistic movement as your character’s armor flows and reacts naturally with every step, swing, and spell cast. Say goodbye to stiff, unresponsive gear and hello to a living, breathing wardrobe that moves with you.

  This mod is huge in scope, so I had to limit myself somewhat. If I had included every single outfit in the game, it would have taken me many more months to finish. So, I didn't include any sets that are considered "clothes," like Common Clothes, Mage Robes, etc. Check out [Modernize](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64776) as it exclusively features clothes.
﻿Dragonscale, Orcish, Stalhrim, Thieves Guild, Shrouded Sets
  
[size=3]No skirts/capes to add physics to. [This](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/84169) mod adds physics to the plume on the Orcish Helmet.
  
  
  
* Savior's Hide
    
  I couldn't make it work at first, so I kind of abandoned it. I might come back to it later. In the meantime, check out my [Savior's Hide Replacer 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/129638), it has HDT physics.
Unobtainable Sets (Tsun's Armor, Carius' Armor)
  
These are basically slightly modified versions of existing sets. So it's not difficult to add physics to them. To be honest, I just couldn't be bothered.

**Performance**
  
You shouldn't notice any performance loss when wearing an HDT-SMP enabled outfit. However, your fps may or may not drop significantly with many characters on the screen. I suggest you test it in game. Go to the nearest bandit camp and see if it's bad or not. If it is, you may:
  
- Open Faster HDT-SMP MCM menu and set it to performance mode
  
- In FOMOD, choose «Modular installation» and only pick the outfits you want. Alternatively, you could disable fur, iron, and hide armors, as they are the most commonly used by bandits.
  
  
**New in 1.1:
  
Player-Exclusive Version**
  
You, the player, and your followers will wear HDT-SMP outfits. NPCs, on the other hand, will wear their regular vanilla outfits. Hugely improves performance.
  
Known issue: texture sets for Vampire Robes don't work. Therefore, while NPCs can wear all three available colors, you will have to stick to the black one. Until I figure out a fix, that is.
  
Also, it is not compatible with main mod patches, unless author of the patch states that it is.

**Compatibility**
  
  
Most texture mods are fully compatible, unless they modify the mesh in any way.
  
  
[aMidianBorn Content Addon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35390) - patch available on its page.
  
[Cathedral - Armory](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20199) - partially compatible. Check out that mod's compatibility section for details.
  
[Xavbio's mods](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/xavbio/mods?gameId=1704) - compatible out of the box, unless you use sleeves or cubemap addons. Check out the comment section for patches!
  
  
[Fur Shader Armors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74118) - incompatible, needs a patch (you'd basically have to make it from scratch).
  
  
[Sleeves of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99651) and similar mods - incompatible, needs a patch. Not too difficult to patch though!
  
  
[CBBE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/198), [3BA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30174) - 3BA conversions available in optional files. Works with regular CBBE. No breast/buttocks jiggle physics though. Sorry, that's a lot of work, I just couldn't be bothered.
  
  
[HIMBO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46311) - conversions available in optional files
  
  
[BHUNP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31126)﻿ - conversions available [here.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99748)
  
  
SOSAM, other body replacers - I don't plan to add any more conversions, feel free to make them yourself.
  
  
[Armor Variants Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34100) and similar mods - these are completely different meshes, so they won't have physics.
  
  
[Modernize](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64776) - should be fully compatible, make sure my mod overwrites it.

I had to learn this stuff from someone.
  
Helxas - for his youtube [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oq3xU3fRf54&t=1s), which taught me the basics.
  
fuse00, Pulcharmsolis, tatururutia - for great examples of high quality cloth physics as well as some of the xml configurations.
  
Everglaid - for their [accessories](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/112481) mod. It introduced me to the concept of proxy shapes, which I used extensively in this project.
