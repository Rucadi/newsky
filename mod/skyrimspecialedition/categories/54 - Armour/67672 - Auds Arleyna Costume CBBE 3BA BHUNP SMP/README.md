**Future Plans**~~So umm like I said this is a beta version. The skirt and the cleavage need more tinkering~~.  Done, maybe a bit more tinkering at a later date
  
~~BHUNP version~~    Done
  
~~Crafting recipies~~   Done
  
Armor set based enchantments
  
Maybe find a way to equip and unequip the entire outfit just using the corset part, if anyone knows how to do that please tell me
  
~~NIController on the glow map (so that the glow slowly pulses rather than being constant)~~  Done
  
Add enb light source to the glow.
  
Probably other stuff I havent thought of yet, I've currently spent around a month so far on this outfit so I intend to milk it with lots of updates.
