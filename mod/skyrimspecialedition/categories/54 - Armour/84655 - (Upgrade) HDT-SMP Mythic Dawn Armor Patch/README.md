**【2023.2.13 upgrade】**
  
***See the picture for specific bodyshape changes.***
  
Adding weight 0 to weight 100 vanilla bodyshape change support.(This will be supported on all my physical patches, just need some time.)
  
Now you can change the body weight, and the size of armor will also change.
  
Support vanilla body, no need for any MOD bodyshape.
  
  
**At present, the original male armor is as weight 0.****Male armor with weight 100 is bigger and stronger.**
  
  
**The original female armor is as weight 100.
  
Female armor with weight 0 is thinner and smaller.**
  
  
  
Delete all previous files and replace by this version directly.
  
It's safe to update mid-game.
  
But don't wear this armor to save and load game.
  
  
  
  
  
This MOD adds hdt-SMP cloth physics to the Mythic Dawn Armor (skirt, belt, scarf and streamers).

Only some meshes files.
  
Require HDT-SMP (Skinned Mesh Physics) OR FSMP - Faster HDT-SMP.
  
Also require **original mod**.
  
Then use this patch to cover it.

*I can make a weight slider, but I think Mythic Dawn armor's figure is perfect enough.
  
If must make a weight slider, the original armor figure set by 4thUnknown should be worn when you weight is 50.*
  
*At present, I don't need the weight slider, but if there are many players who need weight slider, I will consider making it.*
  
  
  
  
  
  
Thanks to 4thUnknown for his amazing armor.
  
I don't know how to continue my game without him.
  
Love him forever!
