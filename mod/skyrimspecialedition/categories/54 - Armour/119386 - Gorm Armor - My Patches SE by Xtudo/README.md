GORM ARMOR
  
My patches by Xtudo****Description**
  
**My patches, fixes and tweaks for the beautiful armor made by****Fuse00.**

  
* Full beast races support for the Helmet.
The helmet will now proper conceal ears and circlets.
  
* "Warm" keyword for the Survival Mode added.
Fully compatible with mods like HIMBO, 3BA, BHUNP, etc.
  
* ESPFE that works with any Skyrim version. It will replace the original \_Fuse00\_ArmorGorm.esp file.
It's fine to update/install mid-game. You won't loose any item.
  

  
**Optional files**
  

  
* **Non-HDT version.** Standalone. All fixes included.
**2K and 1K optimized textures.** 
  
* **SPID Bandit Bosses patch by** [**AzureFailture**.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/164344218)﻿ No helmet version = 4% chance. Helmet version = 8% chance. Can quickly change chance via the \_DISTR.ini file included in the file. Lieutenant, Chief, Overseer, etc will be counted as a 'boss' but of course feel free to change this via the﻿ SPID file by simply deleting the relevant lines. Requires one of the Main files installed first. It work with any of them, Default or Non-HDT version.
**Helmets - No Horns patch.** Only meshes. Requires one of the Main files installed first. It's fine to install/uninstall at any time.
  
* **Heavy Armor version.** A bit superior and lighter than Ebony Armor, requires Ebony Smithing Perk to be created. Requires one of the Main files installed first.
**Ebony Armor Replacer.** Requires one of the Main files installed first.
  

  
**Recommended mods**
  

  
* [Gorm Armor - Consistency Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/119829)﻿ by [Geborgen3](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/118173373). A few super tiny tweaks to the Gorm Armor to better integrate it into the game world. Edited it to be a sort of "upgraded leather armor" and make it more in-line with vanilla armors. 100% compatible with my mod.
