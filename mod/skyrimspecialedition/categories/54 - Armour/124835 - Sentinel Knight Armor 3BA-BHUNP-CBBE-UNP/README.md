[font=Verdana][left]Just a simple quite lore-friendly armor for female characters. Comes with a new armor-styled sword and circlet. Available for 3BA, BHUNP, CBBE and UNP bodies. Can also fit Vanilla, read the FAQ for details. Optional ESL is inclued. Armor Class - Ebonite. Craft in any forge or just pull all the stuff out via any ESP explorer, your choice. Tempering is also available. That's pretty much it. How are you guys doing? How's the weather? [/left][/font]

[font=Verdana]**Q**: **Can I use this mod with Vanilla body?**
  
**A**: There is no perfect adaptation for it, but you can use the CBBE or UNP version with vanilla body, because the armor has no open parts, it completely covers the body. And circlet is universal, obviously.
  
  
**Q**: **No male version?**
  
**A**: Nope. But in this case I don't mind if someone decides to make an adaptation of the mod for male characters, since the armor looks unisex. Publishing such conversions should definitely require the original mod to be installed and only include the meshes conversion.
  
  
**Q**: **Can I make a conversion for [BodySlide-name] or [Body-name]?**
  
**A**: Yup, all terms are stated above.
  
  
**Q**: **No physics?**

**Q**: **What is the name of the preset/hair in the screenshot?**
  
**A**: Which one? The author is indicated under each screenshot. Please specify the screenshot number and the author's name at once in questions like this. If the author reads comments and considers it necessary, they will answer your question about the preset or other modifications used. I can't help you here.[/font][font=Verdana]
  
  
**Q**: **More colors?**
