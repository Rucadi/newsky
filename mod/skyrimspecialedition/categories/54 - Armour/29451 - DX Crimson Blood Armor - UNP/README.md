Gathering unique materials for her laboratory, Valerica from the Volkihar Clan traveled around the world.
  
In Solstheim she found Stalhrim, a rare crafting material that when used on an armor can improve it
  
significantly. The vampire experimented with it to make it more potent.
  
  
However, after discovering how the material can be misused by her tyrannical husband and could endanger
  
the life of her daughter, she decided to hide its secret recipe along with other clues to a place that the evil
  
vampire lord will never visit ...
  
  
[size=3]Valerica’s Research Journal reveals the location of the crafting manual.
