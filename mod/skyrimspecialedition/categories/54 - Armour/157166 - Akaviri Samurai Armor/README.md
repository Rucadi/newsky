# Akaviri Samurai Armor
- Author: RedguardDiaspora
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/157166


A sick-looking SMP armor. It's up to you to decide if this is lore-friendly, but I'd say it is (I'm half-Akaviri so I get half a say)
  
  
- Available for male and female, buuut it only comes fitted for male (SAM?) body.
  
- You can use it on your Dovahkiin woman with no issues, but it may look a little bulky because it uses the same mesh.
  
- The inner skirt and waist-rope pieces have clothing physics
  
- Acquire via console or AddItemMenu, QUI, or SearchUI
  
  
The mod isn't winning any awards for 'best organized' (i.e. the meshes don't have a subfolder, they're just like meshes\samurai\_armor.nif. And instead of using texture sets, the color variants are implemented via separate nifs) but because it uses SMP, and I'm terrified of touching xml/editing SMP stuff, it will remain that way for now. 
  
  
Community Shaders/PBR people: If you know how to fix the environment-mask-alpha-channel-whatever for complex materials, be my guest and I'll include it in here. I didn't get any responses when I asked for help, so I'm just uploading this as-is for now. All the screenies were taken on ENB.
  
  
~~Please don't bother the Arch-mage~~ Please don't DM RedguardDiaspora for support on this mod, just let me know if there are any major issues in the comments here and I will do my best to fix it. This mod works as intended at the moment (except for CS users with complex materials enabled oops).
