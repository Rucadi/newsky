It's still the first half of march! I managed to stay on time for once.
  
And I'm happy to finally present you,
  
[Kozakowy's Vampire Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/95284)﻿!

  
  
  
  
This has truly been an enjoyable experience, and one as difficult, if not harder, than Helga.
  
Kozakowy's works always have these two things in common: they're corseted and extremely detailed. This one is no exception to the rule.
  
This is perhaps the first time I've seen a corset shaped this way, and certainly the first time I've been challenged in such way.
  
  
**A bit of technical informations for the curious reader**Spoiler***A matter of shape***
  
At a first glance it's clear what's there to do: retain that shape. It's clear as day the cups are separated, yet pressed.Normally when conforming an outfit to the reference to apply the sliders and make a conversion, the automated process does a decent job and only some sliderwork is needed to fix the little inconsistencies and potential issues that may occur with bigger or even thinner body presets.
  
This however doesn't apply to situations like this armor, where the corset has a very specific shape to maintain and so many sliders will implode that detail in the middle. Which is precisely why **I've had to manually adjust, and sometime redo completely, almost any breast slider**. From flat to huge, every slider has been checked and edited in a way that I thought would fit both the slider and the intended shape for the body.
  
Needless to say, this was *a lot* of work. Making sure all of it stayed consistent, natural and pleasant to the eye were my main priorities, and I'm proud to say I've certainly achieved that.
  
Another issue worth mentioning: **do not try to force unusually large sizes in this corset**. Due to the all the sliderwork I've done and the nature itself of the cups, you will experience clipping if you use certain extremes. There's nothing I could do about it without penalizing other types of body presets, and it's not something I'll fix. All standard CBBE presets work flawlessly, plus a couple others I use for testing.
  
**All sliders related to the nips have been zero'd**, for both outfit and body. That is intended, as any actual corset would never care about them and there's no good way to fit a corset to pronounced nips. It's also a way to avoid any unwanted poking through.
  
  
***A matter of physics***
  
This corset also had one other potential issue, which is physics.
  
It's clear that the corset *can't move*. It's solid leather, with metal boning on the cups, so the 3BA physics had to work on a static base, no clipping allowed.
  
I'm glad to say, I've also achieved that. The breasts move well and don't try to escape their position either, so there should never be clipping due to physics. If there is, it's likely a stronger xml than what I have in my game, and that's not something I can account for.
  
It's also to be said that due to the nature of the corset and how the conversion was made, many SMP hairstyles that fall on the body will clip with the breasts even if you built their collision properly in BodySlide.
  
To work around this problem somewhat, the only way is to build the collision with the breasts rised higher and closer than your normal preset.
  
  
Now, there isn't any extra work done outside of all the sliderwork.
  
Since the original comes in both replacer and standalone versions, the outfit itself is already plenty modular: collar, corset and pants, bracers, boots, belt and skirt are all separate pieces in the standalone version, while the replacer will switch the vanilla vampire outfit with the complete look.
  
The boots already had a high heel effect, but I switched it with [RaceMenu Height Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18045) as per my usual.
  
Both plugins have been ESL-ified, as to not take space in the load order. The standalone version can be looted from a chest in Radiant Raiment, or spawned through mods like [Add Item Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17563) or [Modex](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/137877).
  
**Currently there's no UBE version available**. Simply because I don't consider it finished, and I don't distribute an incomplete mod for public use. While a version does exist, as you can see from some of the screenshots, it's not in a state that I consider at its best, so I'll take some more time to complete the sliderwork. I can't give an exact time of release though.
  
  
~~Other than this, as there isn't any available smp patch for this outfit, the skirt is currently static and weighted to the legs like in the original.
  
**If a physical patch were to be made in the future, I'll ask permission to the author to let me apply the patch to my conversion**.~~***SMP Patch available in the files!***
  
  
  
As always the mod comes with pre-built zero'd meshes and is fully compatible with OBody!
