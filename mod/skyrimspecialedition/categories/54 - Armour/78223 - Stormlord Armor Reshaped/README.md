Gechbal's Stormlord armor reshaped and added as a replacer for Ulfric's jarl clothes. Sorry, I haven't gotten around to making the standalone, craftable version yet.
  
  
For the armor textures to match the images, I suggest downloading BerserkerCarnage's [Lord of Bears retexture](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/79014?tab=files)
