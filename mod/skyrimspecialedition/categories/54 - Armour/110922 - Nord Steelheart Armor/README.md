In the Northern Realms of the Old Kingdom, the Steelheart armor is a popular choice amongst the Nord adventurers and bandits. This popularity can mostly be attributed to its versatile design, offering a balance between protection and agility. This adaptability is essential for the Nords who navigate the treacherous terrains of their homeland, facing not only the bitter cold but also formidable adversaries that roam their icy territories.

This mod adds a new armor set that can be crafted with steel smithing. Also included are both a helmet and cuirass variant. Everything is on par with steel, except for the Insulated Chest Piece, it's slightly better.
  
  
Included in the mod is a SPID file that should (Hopefully) distribute the armor to Uthgerd and Bandit Chiefs.
