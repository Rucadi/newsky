Description
  
===========
  
   
This is the SSE conversion of the Scarlet Dawn armor by [jmenaru](https://www.nexusmods.com/games/users/2509011/?), ported by [ousnius](https://www.nexusmods.com/games/users/4291759/?).
  
Includes the armor, BodySlide files and a physics variant in BodySlide.
  
   
The original for Skyrim is found here:

It is my design, for the first time, though it still draws inspiration from other artwork and games like Assassin's Creed.
  
   
It comes with HD textures (as if you couldn't tell) and as always it is craftable at any forge, can be improved and can be enchanted.
  
You can find it under LEATHER.
  
   
I've also made an optional texture set that makes the shirt and shawl black and gives the leather a darker tone.
  
It is not the intended look for the armor, but I think it fits very well with this outfit's theme and is a good alternative if you don't like red that much :).
  
Other recolors are also available.
  
   
The CBBE SSE version requires the CBBE SSE body replacer:

To make use of the CBBE SSE sliders, you need BodySlide:

Install
  
=======
  
   
1. Extract the archive.
  
2. Copy the contents of the archive in your Skyrim Special Edition\Data folder.
  
3. Open Skyrim and enable the ScarletDawnArmor.esp plugin (or use your preferred mod manager).
  
\*4. If you want the alternative textures, then you still need to have the main file installed.
  
Overwrite the main file's textures with the texture option.
  
   
   
Uninstall
