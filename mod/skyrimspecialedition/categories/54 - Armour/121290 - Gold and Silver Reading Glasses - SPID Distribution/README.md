[font=Georgia]I like glasses; I think they suit Skyrim well. The Gold and Silver Reading Glasses mod is very cool, and I've decided to extend its SPID distribution so that NPCs will equip glasses even with the newer version of SPID.
  
  
The mod has two versions:

1. [font=Georgia]Covers all NPCs from the vanilla game and the Interesting NPCs mod who could potentially wear glasses. This includes *female* and *male* NPCs of all races (including *Khajiits* and *Argonians*), and *elders*.[/font]
[font=Georgia]Covers all NPCs from the vanilla game and the Interesting NPCs mod who could potentially wear glasses. This includes *male* NPCs of all races (including female *Khajiits* and *Argonians*) and *elders*. This version excludes adult female NPCs of non-beast races to be used with the female version of my other distribution - [Glasses Pack Vol. 1 - SPID Distribution](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/119554)﻿.[/font]

[font=Georgia]Please let me know if you have any ideas or suggestions for other NPCs who could benefit from this mod, and I'll add them.
