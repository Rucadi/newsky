This mod adds a new set of Khajiiti style light armor inspired by The Elder Scrolls Online: Elsweyr. I've always loved the designs of Khajiit clothing, architecture, and music in those zones, which are basically a mishmash of Asian cultures. And since there have only been 2 khajiit armor mods that I know of (there was only 1 when I started), I figured it would be a cool project to try and bring some more of Elsweyr into Skyrim.
  
  
The meshes and textures were made completely from scratch using Blender, Zbrush, Substance Painter, and Marvelous Designer. I learned a lot from this project, getting much more comfortable at Zbrush and trying out Marvelous Designer for the first time. This mod was a pain in the ass half of the time, but it's finally done.[/size]

[font=Georgia]**Some Notes:**[/font]
  
[/size][/size]

  
* The robes work for males and females across all races, with weight slider support.
The gauntlets do extra damage when attacking unarmed.
  
* I've spent countless hours trying to rid the torso clipping. I feel I've succeeded mostly but there may still be some minimal clipping depending on your animations or pose mods.
The CBBE patch just fixes the gap at the wrist when using CBBE female hand meshes
  

  
[font=Georgia][color=#f1c232]**How to Obtain:**[/color][/font]
  

  
* First, you must buy the Crafting Style book from one of the Khajiit caravan traders (Ri'saad, Ahkari, and Madran). The robes 
    
  cannot be crafted until you've at least opened the book.
Have the Glass Smithing perk unlocked, and head to a forge to craft the "armor" with the required materials

If you take any cool screenshots with the mod, don't be afraid to add them to the page!
  
  
[font=Georgia]**Installation:**[/font]
  
[/size]

  
* Install with a mod manager or manually like any normal mod.
If using the CBBE hands patch, install the main mod and then install the patch after that so it overwrites.
