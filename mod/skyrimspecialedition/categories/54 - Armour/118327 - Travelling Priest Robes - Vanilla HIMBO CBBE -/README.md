**What is this mod?**
  
  
This mod is a simple vanilla armour mashup designed for travelling Priests and Monks, it consists of the main robe, boots, and a scarf, and includes various colour variants based off the vanilla robe textures.
  
  
 The armour uses vanilla textures excluding the boots, and the pants/arm cuffs, so their appearance will vary depending on what retexture mods you are using, I highly recommend Xavbio's [Robes Retexture](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/110655) which is seen in the example images.
  
  
The robes and boots have the same stats as the basic leather armour, they are both temperable. The scarf has no stats and takes up slot 46. All three along with all their variants are craftable at a tanning rack, see the spoiler for crafting recipes. They are not added to any spawns/levelled lists or vendors.﻿
  
  
**NEW: Now comes with an optional HDT-SMP physics version of the scarf**, **requires** [**Faster HDT-SMP**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57339)﻿**, thank you to Helxas for their [wonderful guide](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67828?tab=files)﻿ that helped me through the process, this is my first time adding physics to my clothing, it's not perfect but I'm proud :)**

Travelling Robes - 2 Linen Wrap, 3 Leather Strips, 1 Leather
  
Travelling Scarf - 2 Linen Wrap
  
  
Repurposed Travelling Priest Robes (All Colour Variants) - Robe of Matching Colour, 2 Leather Strips
  
Essentially you can turn vanilla robe sets into Travelling Priest Robes of the same colour for example: Necromancer Robes + 2 Leather Strips = Travelling Necromancer Robes
  
  
Not all of these 'repurposed' recipes will be possible, as some robes are unobtainable in vanilla but certain mods may add them to levelled lists, I just added these as a bit of flavour.
  
  
  
Mod comes packaged with meshes for the vanilla male/female body by default, there are bodyslide files for HIMBO and CBBE that come with an optional Zap to remove the little bag, make sure you build them first before playing if you need them.
  
  
**Known Issues**I tried my best with the weight painting but I'm no expert, there will likely be some minor clipping issues and jank especially around the skirt of the robe.
  
  
**Requirements**[Bodyslide](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/201)﻿ if you wish to build either of the [HIMBO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46311)﻿ or [CBBE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/198)﻿ versions
  
Not required but I highly recommend using Xavbio's [Robes Retexture](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/110655) if you want your robes to look like the images.
