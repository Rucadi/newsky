Once you selected your group preset, hit the batch build button.
  
  
  
Want to customize your armor and outfit a bit more?
  
  
Take a look at the zapsliders provided for each armor and outfit. To access
  
zapsliders, when done building the group click on the Body/Outfit menu. You will see everything
  
that was just built from your selection. Select all or some armors and open your preview window if you haven't yet.
  
The Zapsliders section will appear in the slider menu. You can select all or some of the zapsliders to make your armor, then
  
hit the big BUILD button (not the batch build button). 
  
  
Enjoy :)
