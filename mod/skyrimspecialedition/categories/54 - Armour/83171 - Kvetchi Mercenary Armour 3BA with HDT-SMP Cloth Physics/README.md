No, there is no boob physics. No, I won't add them nor will I make a 'skimpy version'. Please stop asking every time I post a conversion.
  
  
The talented [Pulcharmsolis](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/122433248) is notorious for creating some fantastic looking armour mods, and I've finally figured out how to convert them to 3BA with working physics! (Big thanks to [SunJeong](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/76830973) for teaching me how to re-enable physics with Nifskope.)﻿
  
For the most part, this armour works flawlessly alone however as Pulcharmsolis didn't include full pant meshes I'd suggest using a legging/pants from another mod underneath otherwise you'll have some embarrassing upskirt moments when the physics kicks in. I personally use [Gigaduex's Armor Sets](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21836)'s Altmer trousers.
  
  
I'll get some better images up soon, because I use Nvidia Control Panel's Image Scaling feature all my screenshots have to be uploaded at 2k and then I have to compress them again to upload them to Nexus so the quality is dogshit.
