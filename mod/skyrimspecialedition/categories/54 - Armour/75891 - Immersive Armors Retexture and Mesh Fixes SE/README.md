**﻿Immersive Armors Retexture and Mesh Fixes SE**

This mod retextures and fixes most of [Hothtrooper44's Immersive Armors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3479)﻿. The sets contained are split into 3 categories: Retextures, Mesh Replacers and Mesh Fixes.

If you want a craft-only version of Immersive armors, I recommend [Immersive Armors LOTD Replacer ESP and Patches by Sekhmet13](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63950)﻿! It also comes with WACCF support and optional patches for CCOR, CRAFT and OWL﻿
  
  
  
  
**1 - Retextures**
  
  
These sets have been retextured and now use 100% custom textures instead of a mix of vanilla and customs (which could create mismatches if you use retextures of vanilla sets). When applicable, I have also fixed the meshes (deleted unused/invisible polygons)

**3- Mesh fixes** These sets will look the same, but I have deleted all invisible polygons, fixed shader errors and reverted all texture paths to vanilla, meaning your vanilla armor retextures will work out of the box, without needing to make patches.

**Compatibility**
  
  
NOT COMPATIBLE WITH BODYSLIDE OLD CONVERSIONS - Look for patches for this specific mod
  
  
  
**Patches**Patches are included in the FOMOD for [LOTD's](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802)﻿ Daedric Lord masks, [Skyrim Immersive Creatures'](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12680)﻿ Dremora lords and [Crimson Ranger's](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11091)﻿ cloak
  
  
  
  
Thank you for installing my mod, if you like it please don't forget to endorse! Please note that NONE OF THESE SETS ARE COMPATIBLE WITH ANY BODYSLIDE CONVERSIONS - these will break the mod and you will have broken meshes. A CBBE conversion is currently being worked on, I will add a link to the mod page once it is done. If you use any mesh replacer/bodyslides for Immersive Armors, load this mod after.
