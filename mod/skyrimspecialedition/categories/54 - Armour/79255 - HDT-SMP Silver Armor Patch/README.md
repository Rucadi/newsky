All the armors he made are masterpieces.
  
Love him forever.
  
  
This patch adds hdt-SMP cloth physics to the Silver Armor(hair and skirt).
  
Require original mod textures file.
  
Also require HDT-SMP (Skinned Mesh Physics) OR FSMP - Faster HDT-SMP.
  
  
  
*ESL Flagged.*
  
*Fixed some minor problems, such as preview unclear or Khajit's helmet or warm label.
  
But all these little [i][size=4]problems* are not worth mentioning, 4thUnknown's [/size][/i]*work is always amazing.*
  
  
  
*(If ESP is not necessary, then I will not upload it.
  
For example, I didn't upload ESP file in HDT-SMP Dremora Markynaz Armor Patch.
  
I will not deal with any bugs caused by other mods.)*
