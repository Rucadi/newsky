Obi's Headhunter armor is an exceptionally well done piece, but unfortunately female characters were left out! This mod fixes that. I converted the armor to work for 3BA, and also added BodySlide support. It adds the BodySlide files, the female helmet mesh, and an ESL-flagged ESP.
  
  
The original mod IS required, [which you can get here.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/113990)3BA (and all of it's requirements) is required, and ﻿[and you can get that here.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30174)BodySlide is required to build the meshes, [which is here.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/201)The last, but most important﻿ requirement, is to go endorse Obi's original mod! It's a fantastic piece of work, all I did was move some vertices around.
  
  
Make sure you build the meshes in BodySlide, they won't show up in-game until you do.
