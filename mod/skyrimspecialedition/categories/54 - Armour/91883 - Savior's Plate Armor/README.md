This mod adds a standalone 4 piece heavy armor to Skyrim, good for a Companions/Harbinger fashion show.
  
  
The armor shares the same stats and crafting recipe as Steel/Wolf armor, so it should be craftable at the forge, if it doesn't appear use AddItemMenu.
  
  
Male and females supported with vanilla bodies in mind, so no ginormous boobs or large bulges... Weight slider supported. No Bodyslide file included.
  
  
There are 2 versions of the mod, ''Matching Version'' will retexture the cuirass to match the rest of the armor. ''Vanilla Version'' will have the cuirass use your textures. (I'd recommend [aMidianBorn's retexture](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/34147) (brown option will work best with matching version of this mod) In both versions of the mod, the wolf armor itself will always use your textures.
  
  
No light/cloth version
  
  
Plugin is ESL (Won't take mod slot)
  
  
All assets belong to Bethesda, I only modified them for this mod.
  
  
Screenshots were taken by [ShasSaalLDred](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/152271893) (Screenshots use both vanilla and custom versions, along with some using the aMidianBorn retexture)[cuyima](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/12436273) gave permission for me to use his [Sleek Wolf Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44812) meshes as a base

Permissions: Just ask on Nexus for patches/asset use. If you want to port my mod to Xbox leave a comment asking and I will reply with my answer
  
  
Note on Collections: I would ask that you don't include these mods of mine in collections without at least asking first, as of right now there is no system that I'm aware of that allows me to make sure people don't. Thanks :)
