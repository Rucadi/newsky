[font=Georgia]***Author’s Note**
  
And so, we’ve finally reached the stage that can be called the checkpoint.
  
All heavy armors from Skyrim (without DLCs) have been completely reworked to create the AIO version.
  
Originally, this was the plan from the very beginning — but I decided to release each armor separately for a few reasons:
  
- It allowed me to see whether there was real interest in each project and if it was worth investing more time.
  
- I could fix bugs and small issues right away based on your feedback.*[/font]

  
[font=Georgia]*After all, if I had received reports about dozens of problems at once, my laziness probably would’ve won, and I’d never have fixed them.
  
  
**Technical Changes**
  
I’ve adjusted the mesh weights to give the armor a more realistic and balanced appearance.
  
The chest piece no longer jiggles like jelly and now behaves more naturally during movement.
  
If you’re using 3BA, you probably already know that it supports two physics systems — CBPC and SMP.
  
With CBPC, everything works exactly as intended.
  
However, with SMP, it depends heavily on the sensitivity preset you chose during installation.
  
If you selected a more “soft” or high-sensitivity preset, the physics might look odd — so I recommend using CBPC for this armor.
  
  
I also tried to keep the armor using vanilla textures to maintain authenticity and avoid unnecessary file size increase.
  
This means the final color and look will depend on which retexture mods you have installed. 
  
[I recommend using the Xavbio armor retextures](http://next.nexusmods.com/profile/xavbio/mods?gameId=1704) 
  
They were my visual reference during development.﻿﻿
  
  
**Installation**
  
This mod does not include prebuilt meshes, so you’ll need to build them manually — otherwise, your character’s body will be invisible in-game.Launch BodySlide.Select the group **"**Bubblegum Armor Set**"**.Either use Batch Build or build each outfit individually according to your own BodySlide settings.
  
  
**Afterword**
  
  
This page represents about 100–120 hours of my life.
  
I’m not sure if that’s a lot or not for this kind of work — but it’s an honest result.
  
I’m not a professional modder like some of the talented creators on Nexus; most of what I’ve learned came from endless “button mashing” and trial and error while testing things in-game.
  
Still, I’ve always tried to make every armor look solid — never rushed or sloppy.
  
For me, this project became something like a personal milestone — proof that even without much experience, you can still finish what you start.
  
Thank you to everyone who downloaded, tested, reported bugs, and shared feedback.
  
Without you, this AIO probably would’ve remained just an idea.
  
  
**Future Plans***[/font]

  
[font=Georgia]*To answer the most common question — [i]will there be more armor versions?*
  
For now, I’m a bit tired and plan to take a short break, so please don’t expect much new content soon.
  
If I decide to continue, my next priority will be finishing the remaining heavy armors from the DLCs.
  
Now that the full AIO version exists, the separate mod pages will be removed to keep things clean and avoid clutter.
  
However, if you still need a specific standalone version, you’ll be able to find it in the Optional Files section.
  
While there shouldn’t be any major issues, if you run into something unusual, please report it under the Bugs tab.
  
And if you’re using a custom body preset and notice clipping — simply adjust the armor in Outfit Studio to fit your shape.
