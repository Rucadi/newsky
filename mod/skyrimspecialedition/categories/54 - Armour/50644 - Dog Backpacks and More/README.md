Backpacks for the dogs of Skyrim.** 
  
  

  
* Designed to fit [Meeko Reborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17572)﻿﻿ and [Vigilance Reborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17571)﻿﻿, but should work on other dog followers (dogcompanion races) with some clipping.
Backpacks can be made at Tanning Rack (Dwarven Backpack at Forge).
  
* With a dog backpack in your inventory, talk to your dog to tell them to "**Put on backpack.**"
With a dog backpack equipped on the dog, talk to them and say "**Open backpack**" to open their inventory.
  
* Take the backpack off from their inventory to unequip it (duh).
Can also craft various "Dog" accessories at Tanning Rack and Forge.
  
* "Harness" accessories are designed to fit the Harness backpack and can be interchanged, or can be used by themselves.
Backpacks and some accessories provide carry weight bonuses. Some provide armor bonuses (see below).
  
* Dog lanterns actually emit light.
When dog has lantern equipped and player is sneaking, a dialogue option to turn off the light appears.  When the light is off, a dialogue option appears to turn it on (requires SKSE to work). (Any lantern with the Dog Lantern Effect and in the Lantern List will be affected.)
  
* Custom loading screens.

**Notes:**
  

  
* Most assets use vanilla texture paths.
All new records, no overwrites.
  
* If you don't see the option to put on backpack, try reloading your save and maybe reload the game (Skyrim quest weirdness).
Lantern lights may not work after teleporting, should work again after reloading game (not sure why).
  
* Custom dog? Try adding its race to the Armor Addons, and voice type to "\_E7\_DogBackpack\_DogVoiceList" in xEdit to make them work.

**Requires:**
  

  
* SKSE to toggle dog lanterns.

  
**SSE Version:**
  

  
* Saved to form version 44.
Ran files through Cathedral Optimizer.
  
* Tested and confirmed working in-game

Make Campfire version of Harness pack that displays items?
