This mod adds a set of outfit; themed after the renowned Warrior of Light of foretold legends, The Samurai.

  

> Through the study of Far Eastern martial arts techniques, these lone warriors have learned to devote their lives to their cause and to their blades, the mighty katana.

  
  
**Artists Notes**
  
*(Irrelevant to the mod, no need to read; just my musing during the development of this armor)*
  
Spoiler
  
It's time for my Kaidan to get a costume overhaul (Lucien got one looong time ago already). 
  
I feel like a historically-accurate Samurai armor has been done before which is why I went with full fantasy sort of aesthetic of a Samurai; taking inspirations from many fusion-style samurai look from various games such as Final Fantasy and Touken Ranbu. 
  
  
[wSkeever](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/7064860) helped me a lot during development with his feedbacks. He also wanted me to make a Kabuto but I was too tired by the time I finished this look. Sorry, pal! Besides, I'm not a fan of obscuring hairstyles lol so I definitely favor a menpo/hanbo type of headguard. 
  
  
Initially, the Hakama was ankle-length, but I decided to showcase the feet armor (*suneate*) so I cut it short. Maybe someday I will make a ronin-style Samurai with full-length hakama. 
  
  
Originally I wanted to make a pair of *wara-aji* (straw sandals) but I gave up because it's too hard lol. I settled with a *geta* (wooden sandals) but with metallic material to match the entire armor set. 
  
  
The katana Ame-no-Murakumo is the hardest weapon I've ever designed. I wonder if anyone noticed the Samurai insignia from FFXIV on the *tsuba*? 
  
  
The name Genji is a callback to the iconic Samurai equipment from Final Fantasy (Genji Gloves). The name Genta came from Final Fantasy, which was an alternate set to the Genji Armor set. I needed a third name for the third set that have same "gen" prefix, but couldn't find any. I decided to settle with *Gensou* (illusion/fantasy) instead, which I think still fits very well.
  
  
The the fan-shaped insignia in the armor motive is ginkgo leaf. In Japanese art (and possibly other cultures and traditions), ginkgo symbolizes longevity; which I think fits Kaidan's endless loyalty to the Dragonborn.

• Genji set can be crafted with Tundra Cotton, Steel Ingot and Leather Strips. 
  
• For Genta set to appear in the crafting least, you need to have at least 1 Blue Mountain Flower (**00077E1C**) and the Genji pieces you want to craft. For example, crafting Genta Hara-ate requires 1 Genji Hara-ate and 2 Blue Mountain Flower. Same goes for other pieces.

Additionally, I do not want my works to be edited/modified/morphed/derived for SMMB. I do not want to associate my creation with that mod. Please respect my decision :)
