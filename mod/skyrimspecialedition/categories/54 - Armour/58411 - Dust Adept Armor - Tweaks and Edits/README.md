*4thUnknown makes many great mods, one of my favorites among them being their Dust Adept Armor. It's a proper light armor set for any Telvanni character who might make use of it, or simply wear it for style points. However, the mod lacks basic things such as tempering and crafting recipes, and has a few bugs to boot. 
  
  
Another mod by aureoy [found here](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53268)﻿ already provides necessary fixes such as proper beast race support and armor keywording, as well as tempering recipes for the unenchanted set of armor. However, it too lacks things such as crafting recipes and tempering recipes for the enchanted armor. As I was intent on making my own personal tweaks to rectify these things already, I decided to go ahead and upload the changes I've made for everyone else to use.*
  

**As of version 1.2 of the mod, I've done a complete pass-over of the files' designs. For the time being I will no longer be updating the Glass and Quests files, as they're more or less redundant. I may update them again in the future if asked.**
  
  
**All 1.2.1 versions of the mod include survival mode keywords, with the Cuirass and Helmet registering as warm, and the Gauntlets and Boots as normal.**

  
**The main version of the mod adds in crafting and tempering recipes for the armor, requiring Elven Smithing to craft, using Chitin Plates, Bone Meal, Netch Leather, and Netch Jelly.**
  

  
* The Bone Meal material requirement was a decision made based on the armor's appearance, as it seems like more of a mix of Chitin and Bonemold.
Armor rating is about identical to vanilla Chitin Armor.
  
* Talvas Fathryon in Tel Mithryn now wears the armor, with a unique cuirass which carries over the enchantment from his robes.

  
**The Loremonger version of the mod is based on my own game setup, accounting for mods such as Morrowloot Ultimate, Adamant, and Ars Metallica, and the changes they make to crafting and distribution. It is effectively an evolution of the old Personal file version.**

  
* Armor requires the Glass Smithing perk to craft, but you can no longer obtain the custom enchanted set from the original mod's custom NPC, as I've disabled him in this file.
Armor rating is somewhere between Elven and Scaled/Glass Armor.
  
* Has the same material requirements as the main file, only you now need Warped Chitin Plate, which can be crafted at a forge using two Chitin Plates and one Fire Salts, producing two Warped Plates. Requires Glass Smithing.
Unenchanted set has been renamed to simply Telvanni Armor. Enchanted set has been renamed to Telvanni Dust Adept Armor.
  
* An incomplete unenchanted set can be found on the body of Daynas Valen in Folgunthur.
The custom pre-enchanted set of the armor can be purchased from Falas Selvayn at the Ramshackle Trading Post on Solstheim. He only has one piece available at a time. 
  
* Three respawning pieces of Warped Chitin Plate can be found in the chest of the Wreck at the Pride of Tel Vos.
