ADVENTURER ARMOR
  
My version by Xtudo****Description**
  
**My addons, fixes and tweaks for the beautiful armor made by****Fuse00.**

  
* No Skirt version added. Available ingame.
Full beast races support. But the hood will show Khajiit ears, it's because the HDT-SMP.
  
* Reduced specular strength on metal parts, with new metallic texture.
Fixed Female Backpack Clean No Straps model.
  
* Adjusted all crafting recipes, and fixed one temper record.
Fixed wrong armor type keyword.
  
* Adjusted collision of the ground/inventory items.
Removed the frontal cup.
  
* Fixed several clipping.
"Warm" keyword for the Survival Mode added.
  
* I edited some names, to be kind of more "lore-friendly", "Backpack Clean No Straps" is only "Backpack" now, for example. As you can see which version it is in the inventory item.
ESPFE that works with any Skyrim version. It will replace the original \_Fuse00\_AdventurerArmor.esp file.
  
* It's fine to update/install mid-game. You won't loose any item.

  
**Optional files**
  

  
* **Non-HDT patch.** Only meshes, requires one of the Main files installed first.
**Backpacks - No Shoes patch.** Intended for the Non-HDT version, install after it. It will work with the Main HDT-SMP version, but you'll loose the HDT.
  
* **Coat - No Green Potion and No Small Coin Pouches patch.** It only leaves the two big pouches from the back of the Coat. Works for all versions.
**3BA, BHUNP and HIMBO patches.** They will patch the BodySlide Coat mesh file to better suit my mod. They require the their original mod installed first.
  
* **Dynamic Lowered Hoods patch.** The new lowered hood model is Non-HDT, because I couldn't do the HDT-SMP version to work properly.
All Optional files are only meshes and textures, so they are safe to install/uninstall mid-game.
  

  
**I made it for my game and now I'm sharing it, I hope you like it.**- [LE version here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/117376).
