* **11** new armor colors for you to choose from, with more to come in the future.
**5** new boots & gloves colors to match with armor variants that use unique leather colors. **See spoiler window below for more details.**
  
* **2** Outfit records **for each variant** (hooded & lowered hood) to be used for SPID distributions or other functions.
Can be mixed and matched to your liking.
  
* **You can only craft variants if you have the original armor pieces in your inventory**, e.g. you need to have "Elmlock Hood" to craft "Elmlock Hood - Void Black". Intentionally made to avoid cluttering or needing a special item, like a book.
**Ebony Smithing perk** is still required to craft them.
