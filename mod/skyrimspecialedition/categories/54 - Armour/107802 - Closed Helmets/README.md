**Closed Helmets**
  
  
This mod replaces open-faced helmets in Skyrim with fully enclosed variants, designed to enhance intimidation
  
 and style by hiding the wearer's face.
  
If you're tired of seeing the same bandit faces over and over again, annoyed by mismatched skin tones
  
 under helmets, or simply a fan of full-face helms like me — this mod is
  
 made for you.
  
**--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
Update 3.0.0**
  
This update introduces four major features:
  

  
1. Most of Skyrim's helmets are now converted into closed designs.
Existing closed helmets, such as Dwemer and Ebony helmets, have been redesigned.
  
  
2. Unique helmets that previously shared the same appearance as regular ones now have their own custom closed variants.
New closed helmet designs have been added based on material types,
  
expanding variety where only one helmet per material previously existed.
  
  

Over 100 helmets have been redesigned or newly added to match these changes.
  
  
  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
I've used a lot of closed helmet modes in the LE version and I wanted to integrate them in the SE version, so I made it.
  
  
I don't support the beast race mash yet, but I hope it doesn't bother you too much because your face is covered.

Q - Will it continue to be added in the future?
  
A - I'd like to change all the open helmets but it's a big task so I decided to add one by one from what was completed.
  
  
  
Q - It looks different from the image you see?
  
A - It follows the defensive gear texture, I've tested the famous
  
vanilla, [aMidianBorn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35382), and [Xavbio](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/10028290) texture modes, although they're not compatible with all textures.
  
  
Q - How do I make it?
  
A - The basic version will replace all vanilla helmets, the standalone version can be replaced in the blacksmith's box as long as the original helmet is available and can also be made from the same puck and material as a regular helmet.
