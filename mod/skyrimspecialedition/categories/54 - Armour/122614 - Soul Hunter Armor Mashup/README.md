Hello! Welcome to my third mod, the Soul Hunter Armor Mashup! =D
  
  
Before creating this armor, I had been thinking about removing the dungeon from the full version of my Twilight Princess Armor Mashup mod for quite some time now, since the dungeon was not linked to the armor itself. Instead of simply deleting it altogether, I decided to not only improve it, but also create a new armor mashup to go with the dungeon! Thus, the Soul Hunter Mashup project was born!
  
  
  
**DESCRIPTION**
  
  
This mod adds a new set of armor composed of a cuirass, a skirt, boots, gloves and a Cloak. The armor pieces are mage armor by default, but Once you collect the armor pieces and have them in your inventory, you can convert the armor pieces to light armor at a forge.
  
The mage armor cuirass found in the dungeon comes with an enchantment. With the enchanted cuirass in your inventory, unenchanted versions, both light armor and mage robes, and an enchanted light armor version can be crafted at a forge.
  
The cloak found in the dungeon has the hood down, but has three alternative versions with the hood on. These versions with the hood include three different hairstyle versions: Runaway, Desirae and Soundwave. All versions can be crafted at a forge when you collect the cloak from the dungeon and have the cloak in your inventory.
  
  
This mod also includes 9 new weapons with some alternative color version and 12 handmade soul cairn Skeletons that can be summoned after reading the spell tomes for them.
  
The Skeletons in the dungeon also use custom arrows that can be crafted at a forge.
  
  
There is also an enchanted medallion that goes with the armor. The medallions effects will heal the wearer 100 health and summon the boss of my dungeon if the wearer loses a lot of health during combat.
  
There is an alternative version of the medallion that acts as a belt wrap. I originally created this version to go with my twilight princess armor and didn't want to remove it. So I kept it in the mod as a legacy item that should still work with my twilight princess armor. However, the medallion belt wrap will have clipping if used with the Soul Hunter armor of this mod since the belt isn't the same as the one of twilight princess. The belt wrap and unenchanted versions of the medallion, both necklace and belt wrap, can be crafted at a forge provided one of the versions is in your inventory.
  
  
The armor in this mod supports 3BA and CBBE bodies, and comes with a bodyslide preset.
  
This mod does not have a BHUNP version as I personally don't like to work with this body. 
  
If Someone wants to do a conversion, they can, as long as the conversion only includes the bodyslide files and requires my mod to work!
  
  
NON physics version of the cloak and the skirt has been added but arent perfect . These version can be built in bodyslide
  
  
An optional file that replace the color of the armor as been added in the optional files section
  
  
  
**HOW TO GET**
  
  
The Armor pieces, the weapons, the medallion and the spell tomes to summon the skeletons are located in a dungeon in the Soul Cairn, to the left of the main fortress where Valerica is held initially, A map with the dungeons location is in the article section of the mod page.
  
Once you get the armor pieces from the dungeon, you can craft all the alternative versions at a forge: Light armor versions, Cloak with hood, and unenchanted. All the armor and weapons can be upgraded at an armor workbench and a grindstone.
  
  
**INSTALLATION**
  
  
Use the mod manager of your choice (preferred method) or extract all the files into your Skyrim game folder (manual method).
  
  
For the optional red version simply replace the textures that have been installed by the main file with the red textures 
  
  
For the new panties version i added it in a second ESL plugin in the optional file section since i can't add more stuff to the plugin of the main file  . Simply install the main file first and the panties version after .
  
  
The mod includes prebuilt meshes for the armor along with a bodyslide preset.
  
Please feel free to build the armor with the preset of your choice! =D
  
  
**COMPATIBILITY**
  
  
This mod is not compatible with the old full version of my [Twilight Princess Armor Mashup](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71182), as the old full version includes the dungeon that the dungeon from this mod is based upon. It should be compatible with everything else!
  
**know issue**
  
  
For some user the left leg of my armored skeletons can look weird / broken If this is the case you need to use [XP32 Maximum Skeleton Special Extended - XPMSSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1988/?tab=description)  or at least just the nif from this mod that is located at Data\meshes\actors\draugr\character assets/skeleton.nif .
  
  
If you have this nif in your game folder located at the same place then the left leg of the skeletons should work correctly!
