[font=Trebuchet MS]
  
[/font][font=Trebuchet MS]An armor mod ported over from Oblivion.
  
  
Adds 8 pieces of armor which can be crafted at a forging station, with a variety of materials. The armor are mostly balanced to be more into mid-end of the game, as some recipes require ebony ingots to craft. Converted textures from 256/512/1K to 1K/2K/4K (let's thank Gigapixel here), as the quality is soooo much better
  
  
Of course with an added light .esp to save your pretty load order from running out of .esp space. I've got you!
  
  
Also added the usual unholy breast bone bodies - CBBE SMP 3BBB and 3BA
