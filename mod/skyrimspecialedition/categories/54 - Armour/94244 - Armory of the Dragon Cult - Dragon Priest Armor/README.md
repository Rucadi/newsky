**[font=Georgia]Armory of the Dragon Cult - Dragon Priest Armor[/font]**

  
  
  
  
**[font=Georgia]Introduction
  
[/font]**
  
  
  
If you know me well enough by this point, I am a massive fan of Dragon Priests. I love their criminally sparse lore, and boy, do I love their aesthetic, to their imposing armor and their awesome masks. But in the vanilla game, it was just the masks. Well, Miraak got a full set of equipment, at least, but that was it. If you're like me, you were absolutely bothered by the fact that the masks didn't go well with most armor sets in the game. So I decided to be the change I wanted to see in the world. This mod expands upon Skyrim’s Dragon Priest Masks with full sets of armor for each named priest.
  
  
  
  
**[font=Georgia]How To Obtain
  
[/font]**
  
  
  
You obtain the armor sets simply by killing the Dragon Priest that wore them in life. They are initially clothing, but can be upgraded to light/heavy armor at a forge using their respective material. Besides the masks, each set is unenchanted, but if you'd like them to come with enchantments, I highly recommend [this unofficial addon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/134448) that's based on Artificer.
  
  
The gloves and boots are not visually distinct between clothing and light/heavy armor, but the robes are. Here's Krosis' set as an example.

A unique set for Konahrik is also available within a sealed chest in Bromjunaar Sanctuary. Once you obtain the mask, the chest will unlock.

You can also upgrade Miraak's set to light/heavy armor. The vanilla Miraak robes are untouched.

**[font=Georgia]Installing/Updating[/font]**
  
  
  
[font=Arial]The mod is safe to install/update mid-save. If you already killed any named dragon priests, you will need to add their equipment via console. It's recommended that you unequip any dragon priest equipment before updating to be extra safe. Some sets that were previously light or heavy armor may revert to clothing in 2.0. You can go to any forge to change them back to light or heavy armor.[/font]
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
  
  
  
Compatibility patches are available in the FOMOD for the following mods:
  
  
[Artificer - An Artifact Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99619) (Forwards Artificer's Miraak gloves/boots enchantments to the light/heavy armor versions)
  
[The Dragon Cult - Priesthood](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92794) (Changes perks which require wearing robes to instead require wearing dragon priest armor)
  
[Improved Closefaced Helmets](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/824) (Ensures that the acolyte masks use the correct textures with both mods installed)
  
  
  
***NOT COMPATIBLE WITH KONAHRIK'S ACCOUTREMENTS. THE TWO MODS DO THE SAME THING. USE ONE OR THE OTHER. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STOP ASKING ME ABOUT THIS PLEASE I WILL LITERALLY NEVER MAKE A PATCH.***[font=Arial]
