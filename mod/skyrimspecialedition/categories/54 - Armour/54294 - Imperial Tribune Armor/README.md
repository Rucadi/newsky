# Imperial Tribune Armor

I bought this armor mostly for my own personal use but I decided to share it with the Skyrim community. The armor can be crafted with the Steel smithing perk and comes in both light and heavy variants. The heavy variant provides the same protection as dwarven armor and the light version provides the same protection as glass. The cape and ceremonial sword are set as clothing pieces and provide no protection.
  
The armor was created by [Gypsymama on CGTrader](https://www.cgtrader.com/gypsymama), and you can find the original armor [here](https://www.cgtrader.com/3d-models/character/clothing/roman-armor-low-poly-3d-model). ﻿
  
Special thanks to [ScarecroOw](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/16419754) for porting this armor to Skyrim for me
