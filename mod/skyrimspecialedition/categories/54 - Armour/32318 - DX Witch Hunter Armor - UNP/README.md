 Long ago, the Harbinger Terrfyg pledged the Companions' services to the Daedric Prince Hircine in exchange for great power. Since then, the witches of Glenmoril Coven started the Companions down a path that is neither cursed or blessed. Time passed, and in the Fourth Era, Kodlak Whitemane started researching the curse, he learned of a certain woman that hated Hagravens for killing her family. She had crafted an unique armor that gave her an advantage against the foul creatures. The armor itself was long gone, but by searching her hometown, Kodlak found her journal. Using her notes (and unwillingly asking for help from mages), he was finally able to replicate the steps necessary to make it, and kept the manual close, waiting for someone worthy enough to unleash that power against the ones who cursed the Companions he loved so much.

Every single texture on this outfit from the color to the height maps was hand painted in Photoshop.
  
The outfit was made using Photoshop, Crazy Bump, Outfit Studio and Nifscope.
  
  
  
All the recipes will only be available as long as you carry the crafting manual in your inventory.
  
When you are done crafting store the manual and your crafting interface will be free again.
