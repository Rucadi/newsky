# Fashions Of The Banditry 4K - Cleaned and Upscaled Textures

Texture files from the original mod were mostly 1K and 2K, with some 512 and 4K textures. The compression was primarily BC1 and BC2, with some BC7 and BC3 compression. I have cleaned all files of compression artifacts, and then upscaled them all by 4x, to a maximum resolution of 4K in BC7 compression and generated full mipmaps. I cleaned and upscaled them using ChaiNNer/ESRGAN models and then finalized with [Octagon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28773). 
  
  
  
Performance Option for Potato PCs
  
Mipmaps and BC7 compression reduce VRAM usage, especially when the files are cleaned of compression artifacts.
  
For Potato PCs, I've uploaded a downscaled version where the diffuse texture files are larger than normal and environment map files, which are less visible in game. This reduces VRAM usage considerably while maintaining higher visual quality, using the [Octagon config files posted on this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68055), which I recommend using if you have a Potato PC.

We know from experience that modding is an extremely addictive past-time and can be a slippery slope from creating a simple load order to porting mods to going full boat and attempting to rebuild Skyrim from the ground up. That's why we believe in a community that integrates Xbox and PC gamers along with porting noobs and experienced mod authors. We all have more to learn, and modding Skyrim to its extreme is a community effort to say the least.
