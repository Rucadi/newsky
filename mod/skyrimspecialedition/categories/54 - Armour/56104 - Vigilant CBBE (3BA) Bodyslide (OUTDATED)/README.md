**This version is not up to date. But if you have an older version of Vigilant, this should still work
  
  
I am working on the new one, but it may take time
  
  
  
Original description:**
  
  
Pretty simple, just bodyslide files, and an ESL to make em' work
  
  
Just let this overwrite Vigilant
  
  
Couldn't sleep, so I spent 10 hours straight making this
  
  
  
Also, a note, most of the armors do not have physics. This is due to them being solid metal
  
  
  
Full credit for Vigilant goes to Vicn
  
  
Currently Version 1.6.2
  
  
Honestly, just use this one (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43676) it's also got a bit more detail (such as reshaping the armor itself, rather than just adding sliders) and I see no real need for there to be 2 versions. Vigilant armors don't really benefit much from 3BA sliders anyways, so I probably won't be updating this
