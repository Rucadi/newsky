**Description**
  
**My patches and tweaks for the beautiful armor mod made by Ellxe.****Tweaks and edits**It will replace **[ELLE] Brifost.esp**. It's fine to update mid-game, you won't lose any already crafted item.

  
* **Added clothing version of the armored items**, ideal for pure mage characters, for example.
**Added no high heel boots**.
  
* Removed armor values from the Cape and Pauldrons, to avoid problems/bugs with the Custom Fit and Matching Set perks.
Renamed items for a more lore-friendly feel.
  
* Improved ground/inventory items.
Added missing Argonian race to the Gauntlets.
  
* Adjusted armor value from the main Armor, it was 60 (+14 than Dragonplate heavy armor!), now it's 41 (same than Dragonscale light armor).
Changed required Daedric Smithing Perk to Advanced Armors, since it's a light armored set. And now the perk is only required for the armored items.
  
* Adjusted a bit crafting recipe requirements.
Added the missing ArmorMaterial keyword to the armored items.
  
* Added "Warm" keyword to Gauntlets, Boots and Heels, for the Survival Mode.
Fixed missing body section of the armor's 1st person models.
  
* Added missing mipmaps to textures.

  
**Optional files**
  

  
* **2K** (original size) and **1K**optimized textures.
**Heels Sounds patch**. It will work with any version.
  
* **Pauldrons - Reduced Size patch.**It significantly reduces the space between the pauldrons and the armor, ideal if you're not planning on using the cape. Install it last of all.
