WINE DUCHESS
  
My patches by Xtudo****Description**
  
**My patches for the lovely armor mod made by SmolSaltLemon.**
  
  
**My version**
  
**(Fully compatible with HDT-SMP, BodySlides and body-type replacer mods)**
  

  
* **Default** and **Heels Sound** versions available.
**New no high heels Boots add-on.** Both Heels and Boots are available in-game. Please rebuild the Boots BodySlides after installing.
  
* Minor clipping fix on the original Heels. Please rebuild the Heels BodySlides after installing.
Removed weapon adjust from several items.
  
* Removed armor values for extra items, to avoid problems with Light Armor perks. Some duplicated clothes items were removed.
Added footstep sounds to Heels.
  
* Added "Warm" keyword for the Survival Mode.
Tweaked crafting recipes. Now clothing items require less items than the armored ones, for example.
  
* Added clothing pick up and put down sounds to all items.
Items renamed for a more lore-friendly feel.
  
* It will replace the original (SmolSaltLemon) Wine Duchess.esp file. ESPFE that will work in any Skyrim version. It's fine to install mid-game.

  
**Optional files**
  

  
* **4K, 2K and 1K optimized textures**. The original mod is 4K.
**Non-HDT version**. **My version** already included. Rebuild 1st Person, Belts, Belt for Skirt, Boots, Cloak, Corset, Heels, Neck Corset and Skirt BodySlides after installing. It's fine to install mid-game.
  
* **CBBE-UNP-Vanilla version.** Non-HDT, no BodySlides, no Heels, merged Corset and Pants. Based on the Xbox version. Requires only the textures from the original mod.
**Vanilla Vampire Royal Armor replacer (the one Serana and Valerica wear).** All items merged in one main armor. Non-HDT, no BodySlides, shorter boots (for compatibility reasons). Only meshes. Requires only the original textures. It's fine to install/uninstall mid-game.
  
* **Serana and Valerica non-SPID outfit replacers. Boots** and **High Heels** versions available. Only requires the original meshes and textures. Fully compatible with HDT-SMP. You can use it together with Vanilla Vampire Royal Armor replacer, Serana and Valerica outfit will be HDT-SMP while other NPC will be non-HDT, for example.
