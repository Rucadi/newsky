KNIGHT ELAINE
  
Author Ellxe - My patches by Xtudo****Description**
  
**My patches and tweaks for the beautiful armor mod made by Ellxe.****Tweaks and Edits
  
It will replace****[ELLE] Knight Elaine.esp.** It's fine to update mid-game, you won't lose any already crafted item.
  

  
* All extra items are clothing now, to avoid bugs with the Well Fitted perk. Their armor value was added to the main armor items.
Added clothing versions of the main armor parts (Unarmored), ideal for pure Mage characters.
  
* Light Armored items now require Elven Smithing Perk to be created.
Adjusted all recipes requirements. Moonstone Ingots instead of Iron ones, for example.
  
* Added Argonian and Khajiit support for gloves, necklace and hair.
Added "Warm" keyword for the Survival Mode.
  
* Optimized cubemap textures.
Improved armor Weapon Adjust, holster weapons won't clip anymore.
