You can find the crafting manual in Solitude inside the Bards College.
  
  
Be careful when you craft the outfit, it requires 10k gold
  
in total but you will very fast gain your investment back.
  
There is plenty of tundra cotton growing around Whiterun.

This outfit is based on ancient Greek "fashion". Ancient Greek dress code had always
  
been skimpy so this outfit can't be all that far off. Spartan women were renowned
  
for their beauty as a result of their well-trained bodies because of their
  
constant athletics training while their husbands were away for war.

The inspiration for this and most of my outfit mods came from [Minidresses Collection mod by Tiwa44](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/47376/) who did an
  
awesome job converting some of the long dresses to mini versions.
