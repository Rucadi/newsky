Default Nibenean Armors are craftable only. Which is absolutely fine, this is the most clean way of integration, since it's fully compatible with virtually all mods.
  
But since these armors are at least semi lore friendly, they seem to be based on Nibenay region which exists in TES Lore, I have decided that they deserve more.
  
  
This is very simple integration since I'm extremely limited by the fact that they are female only, so I can't distribute them to random NPCs.
  
  

  
* They are now considered exotic rare item that comes from Cyrodiil.
Armors are no longer freely craftable. To unlock leather crafting you need to pick up at least one Nibenean Leather item. To unlock steel crafting you need to pick up at least one Nibenean Steel item. Steel requires advanced crafting (this armor is balanced almost like steel plate), leather has no perk limits.
  
* East Empire Company vendors sell all items from level 1.
Blacksmiths have low chance of selling one random set, general goods vendors even lower chance, steel from level 15, leather from level 1.
  
* Three NPCs got their sets replaced with Nibenean sets. Default version will trigger dark face bug if you use overhauls for these NPCs, use FaceFixer synthesis patcher. SPID version will not trigger any face data issues.
Forwards USSEP changes but does not require it.
  
* OWL compatible out of the box.

  
Affected NPCs:
  
Spoiler
  
Safia, Eriana, Salma. First two random choice, Salma because she wears steel plate in vanilla. I have no way of telling which NPCs should wear that armor, so selection was semi-random.
  
I wanted to give Ria one, but since a lot of mods affect her I have decided that it's not worth the trouble.
  
  
  
FAQ:
  

  
1. **Q: Why does it require scripts?**
     
   A: To unlock crafting after item pickup. As far as I know there is no other way to achieve it, this script only sets custom global variable so it won't create script bloat or anything.
