I've always liked the look of this Shrouded Armor retexture. That being said, I myself have never been that averse to the vanilla version either.
  
  
I decided to shoot for a happy medium by altering the esp to only use the retexture for Ancient Shrouded Armor. It has a grungy medieval-esque aesthetic to it that I thought fits well as an early rendition of the Dark Brotherhood's signature garb.[/left]
  
Meshes and textures were renamed, with the former being given new FormIDs to be attached to the Ancient Shrouded Armor. All other records affecting the other DB armor sets were removed in SSE Edit.
  
  
I don't know if that was the easiest/cleanest way to go about achieving this, but it doesn't seem to have had any detrimental effects on my game. As a matter of fact, it has had the added bonus of fixing the issue where the cowl mesh wasn't visible on Argonians or Khajiit.
  
  
I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed when it comes to this kind of stuff, so this ended up taking me a good day. I figured that uploading this could save other folks the trouble.
