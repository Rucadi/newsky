You can craft and temper them with Dragon Armor perk. The stats are similar to Dragonscale.
  
  
Do you feel like you've seen this somewhere before? Then you must be familiar with [The Amazing World of Bikini Armors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/83383) (TAWOBA).
  
I run a somewhat lore-friendly modlist, so I generally avoid this kind of mods, but recently I checked TAWOBA out and it had a lot of genuinely good mashups. I thought to myself, "wow, this would fit right into my modlist if the bazongas were covered up somewhat". That's what I started with, and then I mashed up some new pieces and added male version on so on.
  
So here you go.
  
  
SpoilerThe fabric on chest may look different depending on what retextures you use due to this piece using steel plate armor texture. You can see what I mean on screenshots - I use Xavbio's Steel Armor retexture, and TESGoon uses something closer to vanilla.
  
It'll stay that way for now, and if I see enough complaints, I'll do something about it.
