Hello! Welcome to my Fourth mod, the Valenwood Ranger Armor Mashup! =D
  
  
  
I originally created this mashup for Auri After i added this awesome follower mod to my game ! I wasn't planning to release it at first , but after i posted a few shots of her a lot of people asked me if i could release it to the public. So i started working on creating a public version of this mashup and seek all the authorizations i needed . =)
  
  
  
  
**DESCRIPTION**This mod add a new set of armor composed of a cuirass , boots and gloves . This is a light armor . This mod also included a bow and some bone arrows to go with the armor . There is also a recipe book that included three different recipe to craft arrows each recipe craft a different amount of arrows depending of the bone object you use to craft them ( dragon bone create more arrows then a troll skull , a troll skull create more arrows then a human skull ) once the book is in your inventory you can craft the bone arrows . All the items can be upgraded at an armor workbench and a grinding stone . 
  
  
The armor included some prebuild 3BA meshes and some bodyslided files a preset is added by the mod and a CBBE version is also available , to use it simply build the CBBE cuirass in bodyslide. I didn't convert the armor to the BHUNP body because i don't like to work with this body but anyone who wish to create a BHUNP version is free to do so as long as their conversion only contain bodyslide files and require my mod to work .
  
  
A new optional file has been added to replace the chain mail part with leather 
  
  
**HOW TO GET**
  
  
There is no dungeon full of handmade armored skeleton this time haha x) .
  
The armor is located at Honeystrand Cave near Ivarstead . All the items are placed on an altar inside the cave you can't miss it !
  
  
  
  
**INSTALLATION**
  
  
Use the mod manager of your choice (preferred method) or extract all the files into your Skyrim game folder (manual method).
  
  
to install the optional file simply let it overwrite the textures of the main files 
  
  
The mod includes prebuilt meshes for the armor along with a bodyslide preset.
  
Please feel free to build the armor with the preset of your choice! =D
