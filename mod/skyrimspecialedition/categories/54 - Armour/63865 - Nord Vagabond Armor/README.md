This mod adds lighghtweight and lore-friendly leather armor to the game, which can be created at the forge from readily available materials. The characteristics of the armor are very similar to the vanilla leather armor. The set includes a male and female (UNP) light armor, padded light armor (with fur), leather mask, hood, lowered hood, padded hood and additional padded lowered hood.
