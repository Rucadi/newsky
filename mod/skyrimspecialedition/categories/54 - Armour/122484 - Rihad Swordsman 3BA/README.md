**You MAY NOT use my mods in paywalled modlists. Already I've seen some 'modlist authors' doing this and I strictly do not condone this. Modlists and load orders should not be hidden behind patreon subscriptions.**Special thanks to [Karasumi](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Karasumiiii/mods) for the screen archery and for helping me with the conversions.
  
  
This armour was a pain in my arse to convert because of the intricate details so please be patient if there are clipping or warping issues. Larger breast sliders will break the morphs, so be aware of this when using your personal presets.
  
  
Requires the original mod and Faster HDT-SMP. Not compatible with mods that replace the .nifs. Not sure if beasts are compatible.
