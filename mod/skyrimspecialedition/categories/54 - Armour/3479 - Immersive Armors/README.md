If you're seeking to enhance your Skyrim with a greater selection of armor sets without breaking from the natural feel of the game, this mod is for you. It adds many new armor sets that have been seamlessly integrated into the world. The items are balanced and spread across your gaming experience. You will be finding new, power appropriate armor sets starting from level one up to level fifty and beyond.
  
  
This mod will be constantly evolving to bring new life into your world. Currently this mod adds 55 new sets of armor to the game (over 60 including variants), tons of additional non-set helmet options, 396 new shields, and a large number of other items such as eye patches, capes, earrings, scarves and more! There are 2693 files in all. They are all craftable, upgradable, enchantable and are integrated into the game through leveled lists, quest rewards, placement in dungeons and/or onto specific people.
  
  
Immersive Armors is highly customizable through the in game MCM menu or spell menu. Since at the time there is no MCM menu for SSE, I encourage you to try out the spell menu, found in the shout powers section of the magic menu.
  
  
Here are some of your customization options:
  

  
* Toggle on/off distribution for an item
Toggle on/off crafting for an item
  
* Toggle on/off distribution to a specific race
Toggle on/off distribution to a specific culture
  
* Toggle on/off distribution to specific enemy types (Bandits, Draugr, Forsworn, Hunters, Thalmor, etc.)
Toggle on/off varied guards helmets
  
* Toggle on/off the ability to break down items in smelters for parts
Toggle on/off overall NPC armor use of IA items
  
* Toggle on/off whether IA items will appear in vendor lists for sale
Toggle unarmored/light/heavy armor type for various armor sets
  
* Toggle various mesh variants for some items
Toggle various texture variants for some items
  
* Toggle mod compatibility for some mods (many popular mods are detected and made compatible with no changes from you)

I would like to thank the users of my mods, and the Nexus community at large. I am honored to be a part of this community, and to contribute to it. Thank you for your patronage of my work, whether it comes through comments, endorsements or even a kind donation. You are the reason that I spend long hours of work bettering Skyrim. The Nexus community is the reason I continue to create mods. Thank you.

Q: The Immersive Armors Configuration has Finished message appears repeatedly.
  
A: Your game and/or save are corrupt. Assuming you have SkSE, you can try:
  
Load a save from before you installed IA.
  
Go to an interior cell (like a player home)
  
In the Console enter: ClearInvalidRegistrations 1
  
Then save your game.
  
Try installing IA on that save.
  
  
Q: I am upgrading from version X to version Y. Anything I need to know?
  
A: No. I make installation a one click process for your ease of use.
  
  
Q: Will you make a CBBE patch?
  
A: Link in the 3rd sticky post.
  
  
Q: I have the following NMM error:
  
Failure
  
A problem occurred during install
  
..."system.outofmemoryexception"...
  
The mod was not installed
  
A: This error has nothing to do with my mod. This is an error thrown by NMM 32bit for all large files.
  
For 32bit NMM users, I suggest a manual install. My mod is only 3 files. It is easy to keep track of.
  
Go tell the Nexus staff to fix this. The best way to be heard is to speak.
  
  
Q: The download for this file on Nexus Mod Manager keeps stopping before it's finished! Help!
  
A: This is a problem with the NMM program, and unrelated to this mod. Navigate to C: -> Games -> Skyrim -> mods -> downloads. Delete anything with the name hothtrooper44\_ArmorCompilation found there. Also do the same for the cache folder found under mods. Now download again.

v8 log:
  
- Delayed most of Immersive Armor's startup processing until after the player's handcuffs are removed. By slightly delaying the run time of Immersive Armor's distribution script, this should aid in removing the bouncing cart from the start of the game when a user with a weaker CPU is running many scripted mods at launch.

- Included basic English language versions of MCM translation files for all official languages(no more "$" signs for languages other than English in the MCM menu).
  
- Tons of new options to control distribution to npc/monster groups such as Creatures, Afflicted, Alikr, Bandits, Battlemages, Draugr, Forsworn, Hunters, Khajiit, Orcs, Robbers, Sailors, Soldiers, Thalmor, Vampires, Vigilants, Warlocks
  
- Added safety checks to prevent smelting of equipped items.
  
- Multiple minor fixes such as the first person model for Ebony Mage Armor being altered, etc.
  
  
v7.1 log:

- Altered Dragon Knight Armor to provide a Light Armor variant
  
- Made Gildegreen Aegis Configurable - Light/Heavy
  
- Made Glacial Crystal Armor Configurable - Light/Heavy
  
- Removed Cloak slots from all but standalone cloaks for greater compatibility
  
- Fixed Painted Shield tempering

- Prices of many items were reworked for balance.

- Removed the Redguard Knight Armor with the cape, and instead made the cape standalone and you can choose to equip it with the Redguard Knight Armor or any other armor.
  
- Fixed a normal map issue with the Falkreath Shield.
  
- Moved the Heroic Imperial Armor off of low level Imperial Captains for early game balance. This set will now have a 50% chance to spawn on Imperial Captains over the level of 20. It also appears on Hadvar for sport.

Wearing Heroic Stormcloak Armor, an Imperial might say: "How dare you wear that Stormcloak filth here!"

- Fixed an issue that made the fur hoods uncraftable.

- A new "relic" shield has been added to the pack. It's called "Aegis of Life" and can only be found on difficult NPCs at level 50+ with a very low drop rate. Alternatively, it can be crafted with the Daedric smithing perk.
