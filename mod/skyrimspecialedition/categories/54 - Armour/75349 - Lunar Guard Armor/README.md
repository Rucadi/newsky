Update version 1.3: Added missing mipmaps. It may provide a performance and/or visual clarity boost.
  
  
The Lunar Guard armor is a craftable heavy armor, heavily inspired by the khajiit. I felt like there weren't a lot of lore friendly armors that catered solely to them, hence the creation of this armor mod. The name of the mod is derived from the Bi-Lunar Guard in Elder Scrolls lore.

The armor can be worn by **any** gender and race. It also has **weight sliders**. The helmet and cuirass meshes are tweaked depending on race. There are 3 versions of the helmet and cuirass; 1 for the khajiit, 1 for the argonian and 1 for all non-beast races.
  
  
The body proportions for the **male** version are based on the **vanilla body**, the proportions of the **female** version are based on the **CBBE body**. The armor covers the entire body, so the armor works with any body mod as long as you wear all pieces at once.

**Installation**
  
Download and install through your mod manager of choice. Remember to activate the ESP. Can be placed anywhere below your masters in your load order, as it does not overwrite anything. The ESP is flagged as an ESPFE so it does not take up a slot in the ESP limit.
  
  
  
**Acquisition**
  
In order to avoid any vanilla edits, the armor can only be acquired through crafting. Stat wise it's in the same tier as ebony and therefore also has the same recipe requirements as ebony armor (including the Ebony Smithing perk). It also requires 1 to 3 moonstones, depending on armor piece. The armor can be tempered (requires moonstone again) and enchanted.
  
  
  
**Compatibility**
  

  
* The mod does not edit any vanilla records.
Mods that change or hide the vanilla body meshes may cause clipping.
  
* Mods that hide the beast race tails such as cloaks or add physics to the tail cause the tail armor to stick out without the tail.
Mods that alter or remove the required Ebony Smithing perk may make it impossible to craft the armor.
  

  
  
**Requirements**If you plan on playing with only parts of the armor equipped on a female character, [CBBE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/198) is required to avoid seams and clipping. Otherwise, no mods are required.
  
  
  
**Known Issues**
  
I've done my best to avoid/reduce clipping during animations as much as I can, but some clipping is impossible to prevent entirely and may still occur.

**Patches, ports, tweaks, etc.**
  
I won't personally be making patches for other mods, porting to other Skyrim versions/games or making tweaks based on user requests. Permissions are open to make any patch, port or tweak you see fit. You may also upload the patches, ports, tweaks etc publicly. Re-uploading the mod here (after it somehow gets lost) or elsewhere, is also allowed. Asking for permission is not required. Appropriate credit where it is due would be appreciated.
