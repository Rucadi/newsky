Hello! Welcome to my second mod! =D
  
  
  
**DESCRIPTION**
  
  
This mod adds a new armor composed of a cuirass, tasset, boots, gloves and now a helmet ! There is now two new alternative version of the armor one chainmail version and one version that replace the female chestplate with the male chestplate . Additionally, there are 6 new weapons: 4 swords, 1 bow, 1 shield and 1 battle axe. Furthermore, there is a new dungeon for you to explore with 9 unique hand made enemies! Clearing the dungeon will reward you with the armor, weapons, and spell tomes, thus allowing you to summon your own skeleton army!
  
  
The armor supports only the CBBE body with no plans to convert it to another body. Since this is a plate armor, I don't want it to have body physics so it has none built in. There is now a male version that use the vanilla body !
  
  
The Silver Fang (sword) and Last Whisper (bow) both have a unique enchantment that increases their damages against vampires, werewolves, and the undead.
  
  
The male version doesn't use the same tasset as the female version , using the physics tasset or the non physics one will be the same for the male version ( both version use the same nif for the male version) . The tasset for the male version add additional armor parts and chainmail parts instead of the skirt of the female version . The armor rating of the tasset has been increased a bit.
  
  
**HOW TO GET**
  
  
All the items are located in the new dungeon: You can find the dungeon on your map next to the area surrounding Dayspring Canyon and Stendarr's Beacon. You will see a cave marker named "Heroes Rest Crypt".
  
  
If you already cleared the dungeon and possess some of the items in your inventory, then you can create new items at the forge. The 1H version of Silver Fang can be crafted if you possess the 2H version in your inventory. The non-physics version of the tasset can be crafted at the forge if the SMP version is in your inventory , you can also craft the armored boots if you possess the classic boots in your inventory the armored gloves can be crafted if you posses the classic version in your inventory , the chainmail version can be crafted if you posses the classic cuirass and the version that replace the female chestplate with the male chestplate ( called "M cuirass" in game) can also be crafted if you posses the classic cuirass or the chainmail cuirass. To craft the silver arrows that go with the bow Last Whisper, you need to possess the crafting book in your inventory. Lastly, all the items except the tasset can be enchanted.
  
  
**OPTIONAL FILES**
  
  
A version without the dungeon is now available . There will be a chest located at dayspring canyon with all the items in it . An article have been added on this mod page to show the chest location .
  
  
A LUX version is available if you use LUX for interior lighting. To install it, simply replace the ESP of the main file with the ESP of the LUX version.
  
  
For ENB users, it's recommended that you download [ENB Dynamic Cubemaps](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98122?tab=description) for real time reflection generation. Make sure to toggle "ApplyDynamicCubemapEverywhere" for the effect.
  
  
**INSTALLATION**
  
  
Use the mod manager of your choice (preferred method) or extract all the files to your Skyrim game folder (manual method).
  
  
For users that use BodySlide and Outfit Studio, it's recommended that you build the armor with the body preset included in this mod. If the sheathed knife looks distorted because of your body preset having the breasts at 100% (if you're using a different preset than the included one), then you can zap it away (along with a handful of other components) to remove it.
  
  
**know issue**
  
  
For some user the left leg of my soul cairn armored skeletons can look weird / broken If this is the case you need to use [XP32 Maximum Skeleton Special Extended - XPMSSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1988/?tab=description) or at least just the nif from this mod that is located at Data\meshes\actors\draugr\character assets/skeleton.nif .
  
  
If you have this nif in your game folder located at the same place then the left leg of the skeletons should work correctly!
