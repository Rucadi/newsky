[font=Verdana]The mod features new lore-friendly armor for female characters (beast races excluded), which is compatible with all popular and basic body types: 3BA, CBBE, BHUNP, UNP, Vanilla, and [UBE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/153437). Since the armor has an assassin vibe, I made an optional replacer for the female version of the Dark Brotherhood armor in the matching color scheme (mage robes are **NOT** replaced).
  
  
An undeniable advantage is its huge modularity. Almost all available slots were occupied, so you can mix and match parts however you want.

Armor can be crafted at **Skyforge**. There is no secret meaning to this, I just like having all my mods in one place.  Also, to say it again, you can always install the optional version with the vanilla DB armor replacer and get it the classic way (by joining the Dark Brotherhood).
  
  

**Armor parts:**
  
Armor
  
Gloves
  
Boots
  
Hood
  
Hair for Hood (44 slot)
  
Corset Misc (45 slot)
  
Leg Stuff (46 slot)
  
Armlets (47 slot)
  
Belts (48 slot)
  
Corset (49 slot)

Mask (55 slot)
  
Chest Belt (56 slot)
  
Cape (57 slot)
  
Armor Cloth (58 slot)

And it comes in three colors: black, brown and green.
  
Dark Brotherhood color is optional and comes only with the replacer.

[font=Verdana]I think that a little explanation will be necessary here. The mod has three main versions: 3BA-CBBE, BHUNP-UNP and Vanilla. All main versions come in 4k. The UBE version is not included in the mod, but is [available as a patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/153437)﻿ created by the talented [Toto](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Riholu)﻿.
  
  
In the same section you can find the Dark Brotherhood armor replacer and textures with 2k resolution. Yup, you can use both the main mod and the replacer at the same time. The armor has only one texture set for all parts, so in fact the 4k version is 2k for each item, and the 2k version of the textures will look like 1k. Choose this setting based on your preferences and PC performance. [/font]
