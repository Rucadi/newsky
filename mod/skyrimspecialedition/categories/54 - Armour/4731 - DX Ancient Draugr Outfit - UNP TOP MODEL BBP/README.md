**Info:**
  
 A light armor that can be crafted using the blacksmith forge. It requires ebony ingots, leather, wood and gold. It has similar stats with dragonscale armor and has a variety of customization options. A war axe and a shield with bleeding damage also included. All items can be improved using the workbench.
  
**Note:**
  
 This is a skimpy version of the Ancient Nord armor that already exists in game, with new high res textures and a few additions and subtractions :) The weapon and shield also exist in game but were re textured to match the armor. Also all stats are boosted but with equally higher crafting requirements.
  
 I tried to make the armor and weapon as much lore friendly as possible using only materials that visually exist in Skyrim. As for lore friendly high heels hmmm, this is as close as they can get :p
