I run a somewhat lore-friendly modlist, so I generally avoid bikini mods, but recently I checked "The Amazing World of Bikini Armors" out and it had a lot of genuinely good mashups. I thought to myself, *"wow, this would fit right into my modlist if the gazongas were covered up somewhat"*. That's what I started with, and it kinda snowballed from there.
