This plugin has been created with the most recent version of the creation kit, if you are on a game version earlier than 1.6.1130 I recommend you use [BEES](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441) otherwise your game can crash, wont start or the mod wont be loaded. If you dont wanna use that mod you have to set the version of the .esp in SSEdit from 1.71 to 1.70.
  
  
Install using your favourite mod manager.
  
  
Optional **PBR** support.
  
Requirements: [Community Shaders](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86492).
  
Don't use PG Patcher on my meshes, just load my mod after your PG Output if the meshes get's patched.
  
  
Safe to install mid-save.
  
  
Default texture resolution is 2k, higher resolutions are found under optional files.
