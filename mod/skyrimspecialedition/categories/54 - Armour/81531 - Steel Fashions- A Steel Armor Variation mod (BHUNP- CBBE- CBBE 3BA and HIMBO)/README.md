A happy 2023 for you all! may this year be more enjoyable than the last one!
  
  
have you noticed that every Steel armor in skyrim looks the same? of course you did, and this mod ains to change that, by adding 5 new lore-friendly Steel armor sets to the game. Less armours this time, so I can focus more on quality over quantity, and nothing is stopping me from making a vo.2 in the future.
  
  
This time with support for HIMBO, BHUNP (thanks to [MauxRose](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/8556963)), Normal CBBE and CBBE 3BA. Every time you encounter someone using Steel or steel plate, it will be one of 5 variations. This is done by changing the Outfit records of the Steel sets in the game, by adding the armors into sublists and then adding those sublists to another sublist of a matching set, then that sublists are placed in place of the standard steel set. This will guarantee that when an actor wearing leather spawns, it will always be the matching set.
  
All armor sets in this mod have the same stats as normal steel armor or steel plate armor, and require either the steel smithing perk or the steel plate smithing perk to craft. you can temper then with steel.
  
  
>Royal-Guard Steel Armor: Steel armor with a touch of royalty. same stats as steelplate armor.
  
>Berserker Steel Armor: Steel armor with a more barbarian-esque look. same stats as regular steel armor.
  
>Duskplate Steel Armor: Black-painted steel plate armor. same stats as steel plate armor.
  
>Ignoble Steel Armor: For the knight without an alliance, in a more conquistador-esque style. two helmet options, one close faced and one open (wich is classified as a circlet, meaning your hair will show up, please be mindfull that some hairs may clip with it)
  
>Alik'r Steel Armor: Steel armor, forged in a redguard fashion.
  
  
A few NPCs will also be wearing armors from this mod, this was done by editing their outfit record, so its compatible with NPC overhauls.
  
  
>One of the Alik'r wariors that appear in whiterun will be wearing the Alik'r Steel set, minus helmet. Same goes for Kematu.
  
>Rayya will be wearing the Alik'r Steel set too, the entire set this time.
  
>Mjoll will be wearing the Berserker Steel set.
  
  
the housecarls will be randomly wearing one of the sets, exept for the Alik'r Steel set and Ignoble Steel Set (Rayya is an exeption to that due to having her own outfit record).
  
  
You will still see the defaut steel and steelplate armors in the game, as this mod DOES NOT REPLACE ANYTHING, it only adds more.
  
  

**All textures in this mod have their textures cleaned of compression artifacts by****[XilaMonstrr](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/126616023)*,* who has also done an excellent [upscaled version of the textures available here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81805)﻿ and I recommend it. Many of the screenshots posted here are with her 4K textures, and she also has performance textures for potato pcs.**

  
***Q/A***
  
  
***Does this work with the Vanilla body?***
  
A:it should. however I don't offer support to the vanilla body. its 2022, come on guys just download a unp/cbbe nevernude with a vanilla looking presset at least. expecting full suport for vanilla body is like expecting GTA 6 to be made for the PS2.
  
  
***Can you release a version without the Trimmed/ skimpy armors?***
  
A:No, and the only armor from this mod that shows a bit of skin is the Berserker Steel set. My mods are provided as is, and the skimpyness of my armors are pretty tame compared with what you see in this site, just take a look at skyrim's defaut bandit armors, they are skimpy, and you are not complaining.If you want to remove any armor of the pack, feel free to do so, but do it yourself, mod authors are not your maids. 
  
  
***Does this mod needs a bashed patch/ does it touch leveled lists?***
  
A: no. I distributed the sets by ediding outfit data, to ensure maximum compatibility, no armor mismatches and a more organized distribution.
  
  
***Does this mod affects NPCs/ followers from other mods?***
  
A:if it is referencing the defaut Steel and Steelplate outfits, then yes, it does, and thats one of the main reasons why I made this mod lol.
