Here's my mashup/edited version of the Dawnguard armor, intended to be used with CBBE 3BA. 
  
This replacer is intended to be a much cuter cut of the armor sets, making the armor much less bulky without being overly sexual or revealing.
  
  
Some notes:
  

  
* It uses meshes and textures from Ralfetas's Panties of Skyrim, so you will need to install that mod's textures as prerequisite.
I am also using Frankly HD Dawnguard, so the screenshots may not look like how dawnguard armor looks in vanilla.
  
* The pauldrons and belts/attachments are originally from Ghaan's CBBE 3BBB Outfit replacer, with some small changes by me, but the skirt and top are my own mesh edits made in blender.

  
There is also a standalone version if you only want it on your character - you can get the armor by using additemmenu or by typing this into the console:
  

```
help "Armor C"
```

  
  
This armor is not meant to be realistic or lore-friendly, as the neck is exposed to vampire bites and there's no way those chest plates are physics, but I hope that you feel like it looks cute regardless.
  
  
There is a bit of sex appeal, but it's intended to not be very egregious or distracting, instead it is intended to be something that makes you think, "oh this armor is so cute!".
  
I hope you enjoy this mod at least half as much as the effort I put in to making it for you.
  
  
No esp is required for this mod to work, just install it into your data folder.
  
Pre-generated meshes are included, I am using the CBBE Oppai preset that comes with bodyslide.
  
  
I've also made a dwarven armor replacer:
