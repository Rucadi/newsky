# Sir Rumple's Armor of Mehrunes Dagon
- Author: Sir Rumple
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

﻿It is well known that Sir Rumple is not a fan of Evil Daedric Princes. He figured a good way to spite Mehrunes Dagon would be to repurpose his Armor and use it for his own army. After much work, this is the result
  
It uses the same crafting recipe but thanks to Sir Rumple Smithing skills, it is a little lighter and stronger than the original

The mod requires the original to work
  
It should be compatible with all body types as long as the armor parts were not changed / renamed
  
Plugin is flagged as esl for your convenience
