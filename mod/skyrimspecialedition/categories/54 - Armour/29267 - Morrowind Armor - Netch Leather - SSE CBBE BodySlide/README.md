===[Guide to convert outfits to SSE CBBE BodySlide](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24153)﻿===
  
now updated to version 2.0

This is, as already mentioned above, the CBBE BodySlide version of the outfit.
  
  
(taken from **Skyrim** page)
  
Netch Leather armor was traditionally an exclusive craft of the Dunmer of Morrowind and Solstheim; they used Netch Leather because on Morrowind it was much more plentiful than ordinary leather, and the armor itself is designed not only to protect the wearer during combat but also provide comfort and protection from the elements.
  
  
This mod adds an entire set of balanced, lore-friendly light armor, including several variations of helmets, cuirass, bracers, boots + shield, and more protective Netch Boiled Leather helmets + cuirass.
  
  
Netch Leather armor offers slightly more protection than standard leather armor and is also lighter, and Netch Boiled Leather armor offers protection equal to Elven armor.
  
  
Netch Leather armor is fully compatible with all races, sexes and standard body types.
  
  
The helmets show long hair at the back, and the gauntlets show claws on beast-race hands.
  
  
The helmets also come in 4 varieties;
  
1) full helmet - the head is covered by the helmet, and the face is covered by the mask & goggles.
  
2) open helmet - the head is covered by the helmet, but the face is exposed with the goggles resting on the forehead and the mask pulled down under the chin.
  
3) half helmet - the helmet covers the head but there are no goggles or mask.
  
4) face cover - only the goggles & mask without a helmet, can be combined with other helmets that do not cover the face.
  
  
Circlets can be worn over all styles of helmet.
  
  
The helmets with goggles & mask worn over the face offer protection from ash storms.
  
  
A few named Dunmer NPCs and occasionally Dunmer bandits in Solstheim can be seen wearing Netch Leather armor.
  
  
Netch Leather armor uses Standard Definition textures.
  
  
You can craft Netch Leather armor at any Forge, and the recipes can be found under the 'Leather' category; crafting regular Netch Leather armor requires the 'Steel Smithing' perk, and to craft Netch Boiled Leather armor you need to have the Elven Smithing perk.
  
  
Netch Leather armor requires Netch Leather and Netch Leather Strips to create, and Netch Leather to improve at the Workbench. Helmets with goggles require a Chitin Plate, and the shield requires an Iron Ingot.
  
  
Netch Leather can be obtained on the isle of Solstheim, where it is sold by blacksmiths and traders, and can also be harvested from the corpses of slain Netch.
  
  
Netch Leather is also sold on the Skyrim mainland by 2 merchants; Revyn Sadri of 'Sadri's Used Wares' in Windhelm, and Brand-Shei from the Riften marketplace. Both these merchants sell all the materials required to craft Netch Leather armor, and will stock the armor from level 10+.
  
  
Netch Leather Strips can be crafted at the Tanning Rack from Netch Leather.
  
  
Netch Boiled Leather armor requires Netch Boiled Leather and Netch Leather Strips to create, and Netch Boiled Leather to improve at the Workbench.
  
  
Netch Boiled Leather can be crafted at Cooking Pots from Netch Leather and Netch Jelly.

A: Feel free to send me PM for the request. However, I will do it ONLY if I like the suggested mod AND if I have time to do so. Also:
  
- not excessively skimpy (e.g. bikini mods)
  
- not kinky
  
- not having extra long skirt (because I'm too lazy unless I really like them)
  
- the original author is still active, or the mod has open permission
  
- it won't require several permissions from different authors
  
- I need to remind you that **I have no obligation to comply to your request(s)**.

[size=5]**Quick Guide for newbies**
  
SpoilerIf you want Physics, make sure you have these installed:
  
[CBP Physics](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13207)﻿ OR [CBPC - CBP Physics with Collisions for SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21224)﻿
  
[FNIS SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3038/?)﻿
  
[XPMSSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1988)﻿
  
  
1. Install [CBBE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/198)﻿.
  
1a. (Recommended) Install Normal Map Options for more variety ("muscles and bigger/smaller breast shapes"), still in CBBE's download page in optional files.
  
  
2. (Optional) Install ONE of CBBE-compatible body textures found [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/198/?tab=forum&topic_id=6037653)﻿.
  
2a. I'm currently using [Fair Skin Complexion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/798)﻿ (for CBBE)
  
Let the CBBE-compatible body textures overwrite the files.
  
  
3. Install CBBE related outfits (mostly bodyslide compatible) found [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/198/?tab=forum&topic_id=6037653)﻿.
  
  
4. Install [Bodyslide and Outfit Studio](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/201)﻿.
  
  
5. A lot of choice here! Install [CBBE Presets Compendium](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11229)﻿.
  
5a. (Optional) and of course my body preset [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24153) and [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15360).
  
and many more on nexus! 
  
  
Now we need to generate clothes and armor with the preset of your choice.
  
6. Open BodySlide (You need first to search the location with details can be found in the mod's description, and then launch).
  
  
7. On top left, "Outfit/Body", choose **CBBE Body** (static) OR **CBBE Body Physics** (if you want Physics).
  
  
8. On top left, "Preset", choose whatever preset you want to use for your player (if female) and female NPCs.
  
You can edit the presets and create your own CBBE-based body type. Don't forget to "Save As"
  
  
9. On bottom left, click "Batch build". By this time you must have all the armor mods already installed. 
  
  
If you later add more CBBE clothes/armors, you just need to load the group of said outfit and then batch build. Also, vanilla armor/clothes will match whatever preset you choose. 
  
  
You don't need mod for vanilla armor/clothes in CBBE.
  
  
If you want to have Physics, don't forget to choose the physics option during batch build process.
  
  
My personal choice: [360 Walk and Run Plus AND YY Animations SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7446)﻿. Tick the BBP option during installation. Then don't forget to run FNIS!
  
And done!
