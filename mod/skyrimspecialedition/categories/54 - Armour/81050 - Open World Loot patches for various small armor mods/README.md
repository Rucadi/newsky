Small patches to integrate various lovely armor mods into Open World Loot's leveled list framework. I created these for my personal use and figured others may find them useful as well. I may add more in the future.
  
  
**By gearshout:**
  
  
[Mercenary Light Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59897) - Appears in hide armor leveled lists. Both regular and protected variants.
  
  
[Black Bear Ancient Nord Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60040)﻿ - Appears in nordic armor leveled lists. Only the regular variant is distributed (not the light or berserker variants).
  
  
[Nord Vagabond Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63865)﻿ - Appears in leather armor leveled lists. Small chance for the mask to appear.
  
  
[Nord Raven Battle Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63402)﻿ - Appears in scaled armor leveled lists.
  
  
[Nord Tribal Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62525) - Made for the **armored** version! Appears in leather armor leveled lists. All color variants.
  
**By Darenii:**
  
[Nordic Carved Light Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58590) - Appears in nordic armor leveled lists.
  
  
[Nordic Leather Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59296) - Stats changed to be a bit heavier and more protective than leather. Appears in leather armor leveled lists. (Because three different nordic armor alternatives felt like too many.)
  
  
[Dwarven Lite Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74725)﻿ - Appears in... Dwarven armor leveled lists, if you can believe.
  
  
**By Sandaron:**
  
  
[Eastern Dwemer Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44443)﻿ - Also appears in Dwarven armor leveled lists.
  
  
**By 4thUnknown:**
  
  
[Dwemer Armor SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81043) - You guessed it, Dwarven armor leveled lists. Made for the **ESL version**. I recommend also getting [Xtudo's patches and fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81046)﻿.

For these to work as intended, you **must** use a patch to merge your leveled lists (if you don't know what that means, read [OWL article here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/3166)).
  
  
It's also recommended to use [Open World Loot - Incompatibilities Begone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63390).
