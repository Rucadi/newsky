Check out the new and improved [Savior's Hide Replacer 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/129638)!
  
  
CBBE 3BA and HIMBO v5 bodyslide files are included in the main file. Pre-built meshes are CBBE Curvy preset for females and Vanilla for males.
  
Textures are 2k, you'll find 4k and 1k textures in optional files.
  
The other items in the set can be crafted at any forge if you have a Saviour's Hide in your inventory.
  
**Any mod that changes the stats of Savior's Hide is compatible.**
  
Retexture mods are not compatible, this mod comes with (slightly edited) textures by xavbio already.
  
The boots and gauntlets are *almost* identical to vanilla Wolf boots and gauntlets, but they are completely separate meshes, so Wolf armor replacers won't have any effect on this set.
