Inspired by the light-weight Skaal armor set (which has now also been made craftable and temperable at any forge) this mod pack uses vanilla assets to create an outfit suitable for those of you who like to wear Heavy armor and want to feel like a walking tank through the cold mountains of Tamriel.
  
  
Also, to lighten your load, we've added a new lore-friendly backpack model with a +60 carry weight enchantment.
  
  
DVAted's suggestion of building the Elder Scrolls' equivalent armor of a Juggernaut's (heavy weapons specialist) attire sparked enough interest to inspire tumbajamba to act upon it. Together we've discussed each shape of the uniquely badass Heavy Boots, Gauntlets, Cuirass and 2 (yes: TWO) Helmet variations for the very peculiar tastes of each of you.
  
  
In our opinion we have achieved the goal of adapting a heavy winter coat to a heavier iron-plated armor that feels both epic and lore-friendly.
  
  
Also, for the sheer fun of it, we've added a boss-type character, Juggernaut, in the Highpoint Tower tunnel on Solstheim, in the Ashlands. If he's not in the tunnel, you will probably find him wandering North - North-West or West of Highpoint Tower, stepping over some Ash Spawn with his large boots.
  
  
!!!Be careful: he is high level, has a great deal of health and is very aggressive!!!
  
  
But he's not overpowered, he actually doesn't do much damage with his iron mace :)
  
This was designed for a nice long duel that you will remember, not for a quick and easy execution of either the NPC or, most frustratingly, of you.
  
He has a short background story in a letter in his inventory, to make the whole setup (and origin of the armor) as lore-friendly and believable as possible.
  
  
For these reasons he will not respawn. Once you kill him he's dead and will only respawn if you uninstall the mod and install it again on a clean save.[/font]

Development:
  
  
The main armor cuirass of this mod is a modified Skaal coat plated with iron armor reinforcements. The boots and gloves are made of bear-fur and iron armor plates, while the helmet itself is a modified iron helmet with extra plating details and horker tusks. The crafting ingredients are according to the source material, although we've included snow fox and wolf pelts in for diversity's sake.
  
  
As of v.2.0 there is now a custom armor model for female characters, based on the female Skaal coat! However, we refuse to take requests for any "revealing", "bouncing boobs" or "skimpy" versions. Thank you for understanding.
  
  
All armors (the original light Skaal outfit and the new Heavy Skaal armor set) can be crafted at the blacksmith forge under the Hide section, and they can be improved at the workbench.
  
The Skaal backpack can be crafted at any smithing forge under the Hide section, but cannot be improved as it has no armor rating.
  
The Skaal amulet can now be crafted at the forge under the Jewelry section, but cannot be improved as it has no armor rating.
  
  
The stats of the armors and weapons are balanced and lore-friendly.
  
For the Heavy Armor set, the values are:
  
Skaal Heavy Boots - Weight 6.5 - AR 14
  
Skaal Heavy Armor - Weight 33.0 - AR 40
  
Skaal Heavy Gauntlets - Weight 6.0 - AR 13
  
Skaal Heavy Helmet - Weight 5.0 - AR 14.5
  
Skaal Horned Helmet - Weight 6.0 - AR 16
  
(below Heavy Chitin and above Bonemold armor)
  
  
For the light armor we left the values vanilla,
  
except for the Skaal Amulet whose weight we increased to 0.20 from 0.0, and dropped the monetary value from 1000 to 100 (to avoid it being used as an exploit to get money).
  
The backpack also has no armor rating, but a carry weight capacity increase of 60 points.

Compatibilities & Conflicts:
  
  
Mods that modify the values of the light skaal armor are compatible. Mods that modify the Skaal Amulet will conflict, and only the mod whose .esp is lower in your load order will take effect.
  
Mods that make the light skaal armor or amulet craftable are compatible, but then they would have duplicate entries at the forge.
  
  
Mods that modify the Highpoint Tower exterior cell may cause the NPC Juggernaut to not appear, or he will fight the hell out of whoever else is around.
  
  
Our models use only vanilla textures (we have actually not included any custom texture at all), so any retexture mods of either the Skaal outfit, the thief armor's textures, the bear and horker creatures or the iron armor set will also affect the appearance of the Heavy Skaal Armor or of the backpack. This is not necessarily a bad thing, in fact it could actually look completely awesome!
  
Post screenshots of your combinations of either :D
