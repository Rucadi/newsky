Description:
  
The "Imperial or Stormcloak Ranger Set" mod is the same style of my other mods "Gondorian Ranger Armor" and "Gondorian Ranger Bow", the only asset i use in this mod from GRA mod is the remodeled mesh that removes side bag with it's belt and pouches, which is remodeled by Faelrin, the rest of all of the work, meshes and textures, i edited all from scratch with the same way from GRA mod and not used the same assets from it!
  
I made the "Imperial Ranger Set" and "Stormcloak Ranger Set" separate main files
  
for those want only one side to play and it will take less time to download.
  
But those who want to play both sides, one after the other,
  
they can download the big main file "Imperial & Stormcloak Ranger Set"
  
which includes both armor meshes/textures and one merged esp.
