This plugin has been created with the most recent version of the creation kit, if you are on a game version earlier than 1.6.1130 I recommend you use [BEES](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441) otherwise your game can crash, wont start or the mod wont be loaded. If you dont wanna use that mod you have to set the version of the .esp in SSEdit from 1.71 to 1.70.
  
  
Install using your favourite mod manager.
  
  
Optional Complex Material support.
  
Spoiler
  
Recommended to use [ENB Dynamic Cubemaps](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98122), this mod replaces all vanilla cubemaps with dynamic ones.
  
Requirements: ENB or [Community Shaders](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86492)
  
  
**ENB** users on a recent version like 0.499, have to set
  
EnableComplexMaterial=true and EnableDynamicCubemap=true.
  
If these are greyed out in your ingame ENB control panel you have to set them manually in your enbseries.ini located in your Skyrim folder.
  
**Community Shader** users have to use [Dynamic Cubemaps](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/112763) and [Complex Parallax Materials](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/95134?tab=description).
  
  
You have to build the outfit in Body Slide.
  
  
Safe to install mid-save.
  
  
Default texture resolution is 2k, higher resolutions are found under optional files.
