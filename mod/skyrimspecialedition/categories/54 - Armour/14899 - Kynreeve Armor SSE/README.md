**[Classic Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/89151)﻿ | [XBox](https://bethesda.net/en/mods/skyrim/mod-detail/4051830)﻿**
  
  
*Craftable light and heavy sets of daedric style armor for males.*
  
  
**Main - Craftable Stand-Alone Light and Heavy Sets**

This is a direct copy of the armor worn by Kynreeve Kahl as seen in my dremora follower mod["Kynreeve - A Summonable Dremora Follower"](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14935/). 
  
  
Light and Heavy sets are available for crafting at any forge. Requires the Daedric Smithing perk.
  
  
**New in V 1.1:** One of each full set can be acquired by defeating a pair of Dremora Kynreeve in an encounter on the eastern edge of the Skytemple Ruins island. Enemies are level 30 - be prepared. Check the images tab for the exact location.
  
  
Please be aware: this set was created for a specific character. I made no attempt to accommodate females or beast races.
  
  

**Optional - Daedric Mesh Replacer**﻿

By request, mesh replacers for vanilla (male) daedric armor.

**Pick one:
  
Meshes Only:**A simple mesh replacer. Recommended for most mod load-orders.
  
**ESP Replacer:** Includes an esp that edits the daedric ArmorAddons and Armor records. Use this if you have a conflicting mod that edits the slots of daedric armor. (You will notice body parts turning invisible, if this is the case.) Place the ESP after the conflicting mod in your load order.
