(\*Who is Beastmaster Mihail? He is my avatar/persona within the universe composed of all my mods. He is the ingame author who writes the texts that are usually presented as descriptions for my mods. A former monster hunter, now a dedicated scholar, he is planned to be released as an NPC in late 2022/early 2023, doing the same job in-game as my descriptions do on Nexus.)

 **Technical info:** despite its more robust and impractical form, the Stonefire Set is a valuable set for those who manage to obtain it, since it offers superior protection to the vanilla Daedric Armor, despite weighing considerably more, and in terms of gameplay, it doesn't affect the player's mobility any more than any other heavy armor. As the vanilla daedric set, the Stonefire Set can only be obtained by crafting the pieces in forges if you have the daedric smithing perk, and it can be improved as well. The armor is unisex, and can be worn by any race. Shield will be included in the Stonefire Weaponry mod, not yet released when this armor was published.

[font=Times New Roman]Playable races added via mod may not be compatible with this armor, requiring patch.
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)
