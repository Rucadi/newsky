For the recipes to appear in the crafting interface you need to have the crafting manual in your inventory!

A new craftable armor/outfit found under leather and misc categories for light armor and cloth outfit respectively.
  
  
The outfit features the Necromancer's Grip enchant that makes the wearer move quietly and damage all nearby opponents with 5 points of poison damage per second. Also reduces the cost of conjuration spells by 25% and increases magicka regen by 150%.

 This is the eighth armor of a series that will hopefully reach twenty four armors. The idea originated from Minidresses Collection mod by Tiwa44 who did an awesome job converting some of the long dresses to mini versions.
  
  
These armors will not offer any protection in real life so don't use them at home!
  
  
**A big THANK YOU here to all of you guys that endorsed,commented or just played and keep playing using this and the previous mods!**

If for any reason you can't find the book, type help "Sotteta Necromancer Crafting Manual" and player.additem xxxxxxxx 1 in the console to get the recipe book manually.
  
Also if you want to avoid gathering the materials, there are enough materials inside the bag of crafting supplies to create each of the recipes once.
