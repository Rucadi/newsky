* Eslify the plugin (require new game if you already have the original)
Separate the gorget from the main armor
  
* Add separate gauntlets mesh, the original version use vanilla Daedric Gauntlets
Enhance the chainmail so it can withstand the more "extreme" body presets

Immersive physic, the metal parts will not jiggle along with character's boobs and cake

**How to Get It**
  
In the original mod, the armors are craft only, meaning you can't acquire them immersively in the world.
  
An option is available that will add a Dremora in Mehrune Dagon Shrine who have the complete set, fight her and loot the armor, but don't expect an easy fight.
  
Require: [Female Dremora Lord](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/122998) by [AizenV](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/96562848)
  
  
**Vanilla Replacer**
  
An option is available to make this armor as replacer for vanilla Daedric Armors. 
  
Note regarding the Crown/Mask:
  

  
* You can have Remodeled Daedric Crown/Mask as a replacer for vanilla Daedric Helmet.
The ESP may conflict with other mods, so set the load order accordingly, check it with SSEEdit if you have to.
  
* To fully uninstall this helmet replacer, you might have to go to "*..\Data\Meshes\armor\daedric*", and then delete "*DaedricHelmetF\_0.nif*" and "*DaedricHelmetF\_1.nif*".
