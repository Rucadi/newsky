﻿
  
﻿
  
I prob won't do preview pictures for all items, (image perms are open, so feel free to post yours)
  
Instead here is a video where I browse thru most of them in inventory (updated for 2.0), so you get a picture what to expect content wise:
  
  
  
  
**Basic Installation Main:**
  
Spoiler
  
- Download the main file.
  
  
- Install with your mod manager.
  
  
﻿- Go thru the installer.
  
  
- Batch Build in Bodyslide group:
  
*Tawoba\_Imperial\_kp84*
  
(or search in outfits:Tawoba Imperial)
  
 
  
Done.
  
  
  
  
**Installation Optional BS customization (recommended):**Spoiler
  
After doing the *Basic Installation Main* above:
  
  
- In Bodyslide select group:
  
*Tawoba\_Imperial\_**xtra**\_kp84*
  
- Go thru items in it one by one, customize to your liking, and build one by one.
  
  
Done.
  
  
**Tips:**
  
As a side note, adjust sliders for both weights, 0 and 100.
  
Press T to hide textures, W will enable wireframe overlay.
  
You can go above 100 or even negative values if you type them in.

**Once you are happy with the sliders, you can save them to your body Preset.**All of the extra sliders and zaps have unique names, so when you open the outfit in Bodyslide next time, it will have the options selected as you saved them. this applies to batch building too.
  
  
You can also build items while in-game (after building once game not running), just re-equip them to see changes.

**Enviromental map textures, metallic cubemap reflections, aka potential mod conflicts.**Spoiler
  
  
**tldr:**
  
**Only** potential mod conflict is your Imperial texture replacer, **IF** it adds the env map textures also, that are missing from vanilla game.
  
  
**If it does, let your texture replacer overwrite the env map textures in this one.**
  
----
  
  
xml (physics config files) files are same as some other mods, but they are assigned to own folder, so they won't overlap with original mods.
  
Check Credits tab for more info which mods.
  
  
----
  
  
**Extra info on the env maps that this mod adds:**
  
  
- Based on vanilla diffuse texture.
  
- They do nothing on their own, For *models outside this mod*, [need to be edited to use them](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/9553)﻿.
  
- If assigned to a model, will control metallic reflections.
  
- BC1 compression (very light textures)
  
  
- I assigned: textures\cubemaps\shinydull\_e.dds, as the cubemap for all models.
  
-> If you use non dynamic cubemaps, that is the reflection
  
-> If you use dynamic cubemaps (enb or CS vanilla replacers),
  
you will get dynamic cubemaps in game.
  
  
- As side note, these models *should be* Complex Material ready (no PG patcher needed),
  
If and once CM textures will be released by someone.
  
  
For more info on cubemaps check [this article](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/6392)﻿.
  
  
Only other textures added by this mod, are for the crafting books, should not collide with any other mod.
  
  
  
  
**How To acquire in-game, CID, BOS, crafting.**
  
  
Spoiler
  
  
At the time of release, no implementation to npcs.
  
Keep a look out for potential Skypatcher, SPID or so mods,
  
for example [this one adds these to containers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/155193)﻿,
  
but I won't be making one myself.
  
  
You can add these via console, or various mods that let you add modded content for your character.
  
  
Also, **this mod comes with Crafting books**, for both sets.
  
As long as you have the book in your inventory, and you have Steel smithing perk,
  
Pieces from this mod show up when crafting. Without book, they don't show up/clutter the crafting menu.
  
  
You can temper the items without the book.
  
  
**To acquire the book in game, I have provided two optional files:**
  
  
**[BoS](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805)﻿ file:**
  
  
Replaces couple generic books in Castle Dour. Room next to the central table, where you give your oath when joining Imperials.
  
  
![](https://i.postimg.cc/prjsx3xG/Screen-Shot5941.png)﻿![](https://i.postimg.cc/Z5HVT8kx/Screen-Shot5942.png)﻿
  
Take note if another mod removes etc these books, they might not be there.
  
  
You can also edit the BOS file yourself;
  
just change the ref id to something else in the BOS ini, select item you want in-game with console, type down the ref id, and the source of it (Skyrim.esm etc), and change the first part of the line in the ini with notepad.
  
  
Edit *TAWOBALHImpebook\_SWAP* to make own changes to this.
  
  
**[CID](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99486) file:**
  
  
Distributes the books to various merchants:
  
  
- Belethor's goods
  
- Khajiit merchants
  
- Riverwood Trader
  
- Solitude Bits and Pieces
  
- Solitude East Empire company
  
- Imperial Civil war camps Quarter masters
  
  
Edit *Tawoba\_Impe\_CID.ini* to make own changes to this.
  
  
![](https://i.postimg.cc/PtHgTyD4/Screen-Shot5943.png)﻿
  
[size=2]**Adding the books without BOS or CID files:**
  
  
The books are called:
  
"Imperial Heavy Bikini Armor Crafting Guide"
  
"Imperial Light Bikini Armor Crafting Guide"
  
  
in console, search for example this:
  
*help "Imperial Heavy Bikini" 4*
  
will give the id you need.
  
  
If the id is for example FE0018C9 then just use command:
  
player.additem FE0018C9 1
  
  
It will add it to your inventory.
  
  
There is also various mods that let you easily take/explore items from mods, I personally use this:
  
<https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64653>[/size]
  
  
  
  
**Helmet Toggle 2 Support:**
  
  
Spoiler
  
  
![](https://i.postimg.cc/52XVhqkK/The-Elder-Scrolls-VSkyrim-Special-Edition-2025-09-27-15-51-ezgif-com-optimize.gif)﻿
  
  
Automatic support for half helmets (circlets), masks, and hoods.
  
  
Masks and Hoods have own lowered models for HT2,
  
that you can not directly equip in game (not inventory items).
  
  
Not to be confused with "Lowered Hood" item that you can equip from inventory.
  
This item is ignored by HT2, so if you want permanent lowered hood (or you don't use HT2), you can equip that.
  
If you want the dynamic HT2 raised and lowered hoods, just equip the normal raised hood, HT2 will deal with switching between the lowered, and raised one.
  
  
As of 2.0 update, Beast races are included.
  
  
  
  
**IER, ORF, Baka, TNG, Sos and Modesty Support:**
  
  
Spoiler
  
  
Adds own ini for Modesty keywords.
  
Adds own ini for Item equip restrictor, that prevents males trying to wear these.
  
Adds own ini for Outfit Recognition Framework keywords.
  
Adds own ini for BakaFactory SLA keywords.
  
Adds own ini for TNG keywords, if you use 4.0+ version of it, you prob don't need this.
  
Adds own ini for Schlongs of Skyrim keywords, I recommend using TNG over SoS.
  
  
  
  
  
**Extra ramblings:**
  
  
Esp (light) is called TAWOBA\_impe.esp.
  
Main file do not come with pre-built meshes, optional files has CBBE Vanilla pre-built meshes for those who want them.
  
  
The long HDT capes, and some hdt loincloths, use textures that you have installed at:
  
﻿textures\architecture\solitude\sbanner01.dds, and textures\architecture\solitude\sbanner01\_n.dds.
  
and
  
textures\dungeons\ships\shipimperialcloth01.dds, and textures\dungeons\ships\shipimperialcloth01\_n.dds.
  
  
I used this replacer personally for banners: [Rally's Banners of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/116289)﻿
  
  
  
**Armor rating/gold value** I tried to balance to what it would be if wearing vanilla Imperial sets.
  
Boots, gloves, and head piece have same values as vanilla, rest of the modular pieces come close to what vanilla torso is.
  
  
Can be crafted at forge, tempered at armor bench.
  
Requires Crafting book in inventory for them to show up in crafting menu.
  
Light and Heavy versions have separate books.
  
  
SMP items, have been edited from various sources, check credits tab.
  
xml files from them are untouched, but relocated, so they don't overlap with the originals.
  
  
As stated above, this uses Imperial textures you have installed, for reference to my preview pictures, I'm using the excellent [Frankly HD Imperial Armor And Weapons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20848).
  
(It also has [PBR version](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/155958)﻿ for Cs users, crossing fingers for Complex Material version in future for us ENB users)
  
  
  
Been working on this on and off for a long time,
  
so let me know if I made mistake somewhere, or missed something obvious, or suggestions are welcome too.
  
Thank you.
  
  
No doubt I will add more in future patches, but I had to draw the line somewhere for release,
  
this is already quite big mod.
  
  
**Image perms are open, post yours,** just no nudity, keep tops and bottoms on to keep Nexus happy, 
  
not mandatory but would be nice if you mentioned in description which Imperial texture replacer you use,
  
for reference.
  
  
As side note, whats next, my older Stormcloaks and Sons of Skyrim TAWOBA add ons will get a 2.0 reworks.
