﻿﻿Adds a new color to the Ebony Valkyrie armor by Contentcat in the usual Sir Rumple Style of Black with Red Highlights

It only adds colors using texture sets from the plugin. It should therefore work with all body types, unless the texture path was modified.
  
  
This adds a new female armor set only. Comes with 3 different boots (2 high heels)
  
It must be crafted or added using a mod like Additem menu or Modex
  
Recipe and stats are the same as the original
  
  
Original mod and all it's requirements are needed.
  
Plugin is flagged as esl for your convenience.﻿﻿
