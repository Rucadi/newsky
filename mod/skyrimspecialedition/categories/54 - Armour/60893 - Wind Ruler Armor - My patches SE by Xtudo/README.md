﻿Wind Ruler Armor - My patches**
  
**By Xtudo**

  
**Description**
  
**Several patches for this wonderful armor made by 4thUnknown.
  
  
Important:**The HDT-SMP version is not ALL compatible, it will conflict with my patches that edits the armor's meshes, like the weight sliders. The texture ones, the one handed sword, are good to go.
  
  
**Recommended installation order:**

  
* Fixes or Light Armor version SE or Unenchanted Helmet SE.
Bigger helmets SE.
  
* Male weight sliders SE or HIMBO version.
Female weight sliders - More feminine version SE.
  
* Wind Ruler Armor - Scabbard SE.
Wind Ruler Armor - One handed sword SE.
  
* Any aesthetic file, like color changers.

  
**Patches
