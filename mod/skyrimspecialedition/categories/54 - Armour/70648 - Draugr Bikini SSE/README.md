**//////////ABOUT THE MOD\\\\\\\\\\**

Oh snap here we go again!
  
  
Thank you for joining me in my third attempt to get Nise-kun's attention (and some more bottomless tributes lol).
  
  
Today's newest bikini rendition: the Draugr Bikini Set.
  
  
This set includes over 30 new pieces of craftable, enchantable, gear with 3BA and SMP support also available.
  
  
  
**//////////IN GAME ACQUISITION\\\\\\\\\\**

The book for armor can be found at [Volunruud](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Volunruud)﻿, placed inside a large treasure chest laying on its side in downstairs room left of when you first enter the ruin.
  
  
Once the book is in your possession, you'll need the "Steel Smithing" perk to actually forge the armors.

**[u]//////////REQUIREMENTS[/u]\\\\\\\\\\**
  
  
A legit copy of the base game
  
  
XP32 Maximum Skeleton Special Extended SE
  
  
CBPC Physics (for default mesh files)
  
  
HDT-SMP Physics (available via Bodyslide files only)
  
  
CBBE 3BA (available via Bodyslide files only)
  
  
Racemenu (for the NiOverride heel effect)

Some working knowledge of using the Bodyslide program.
  
(for the Bodyslide files only).
  
  
  
**[u][u]//////////[/u][/u]KNOWN ISSUES/CONFLICTS\\\\\\\\\\**
  
  
Like the bikinis mods of old, this WILL conflict with mods like "Devious Devices" or "Dual Sheath Redux".
  
  
These conflicts won't crash your game, but will keep certain pieces from appearing when equipped due to body slot conflicts.
  
  
For any SOS users, please enable the "Revealing Option" in the SOS MCM menu.
  
  
For any who use Devious Devices, please use  the "Device Hider"" option in the mod's MCM menu.

﻿Q: Is this a light armor mod or heavy armor mod?

  

﻿A: Heavy. Like Heavy D. You know the rapper? From the early nineties? Did the songs "Now that we found Love" and "Is it good to You"? Nothing? Really?!
  
Wow I'm age checking myself here...

Q: Still questing for NiseTanaka's attention?
  
  
A: Here's hopping third times a charm!
  
-
  
Q: Any chance you'll provide support for other body replacers like BHUNP?
  
  
A: Since I don't use BHUNP personally and the amount of work it takes to convert to that body with its MANY numerous sliders, I'm gonna pass. But if anyone else wants to take a shot at it and share the conversions, I am totally on board with it. (as my perms were set up to encourage this)

Q: Shameless as ever I see.
  
  
A: ...and I'm just getting started!
