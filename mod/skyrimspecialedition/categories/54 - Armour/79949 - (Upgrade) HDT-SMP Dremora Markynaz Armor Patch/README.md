【2023.3.29 upgrade】
  
*See the picture for specific bodyshape changes.*
  
  
Adding weight 0 to weight 100 vanilla bodyshape change support.(This will be supported on all my physical patches, just need some time.)
  
Now you can change the body weight, and the size of armor will also change.
  
Support vanilla body, no need for any MOD bodyshape.
  
**Also add a slight chest curve to the female armor version.**
  
  
**At present, the original male armor is as weight 0.
  
Male armor with weight 100 is bigger and stronger.
  
  
The original female armor is as weight 50.
  
Female armor with weight 0 is thinner and smaller.
  
[b][b]Female** armor with weight 100 is bigger and fuller.
  
  
*What changes have been made to the esp file?*
  
*Armor Addon (shown in the second picture).*[/b][/b]
  
  
Only some meshes files and esp file (flagged as esl, necessary).
  
Require original mod and HDT-SMP Dremora Markynaz Armor Patch.
  
Then use this to completely cover it.

Love him forever!
  
Thank him for saving my Skyrim armor mods.
  
I don't even know how to continue my game without him.
  
  
This patch adds hdt-SMP cloth physics to the Dremora Markynaz Armor(skirt).
  
Require original mod textures file and esp file.
  
Also require HDT-SMP (Skinned Mesh Physics) OR FSMP - Faster HDT-SMP.
  
 
  
*Fixed some minor problems, such as primary image's boots shown.
  
When [i]boots*move, they will break through the *meshes* a little.
  
Fixed the problem by adding NPC L/R Thigh [L/RThg] weight to the *boots.*
  
But all these little *problems* are not worth mentioning, 4thUnknown's [/i]*work is always amazing.*
