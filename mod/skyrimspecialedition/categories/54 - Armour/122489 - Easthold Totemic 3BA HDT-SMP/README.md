Special thanks to [Karasumi](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Karasumiiii/mods) for the screen archery and for helping me with the conversions.
  
  
  
Fully converted armour with working HDT-SMP for the dangling medals and careful attention to fix the majority of clipping. Sadly because this outfit is all strips of cloth it's difficult for me to stop ALL clipping, but I've done as much as possible with the tools available.
