This mod adds a standalone heavy armor set and one handed sword inspired by Elden Ring.
  
  
The armor and sword all share the exact same stats and recipes as vanilla Ebony armor, which means you craft them at a forge under the Ebony section! (Or use console commands/[AddItemMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17563))
  
  
Armor in game is named ''Tarnished [Armor Piece]''. Weapon is ''Tarnished Sword''.
  
  
No HDT SMP on this mod, Males and Females have custom meshes. Textures are all 4K Resolution! **If anyone wants there to be a HDT SMP version, message me and we can discuss!**
  
There is 1 main file for this mod.
  
  
**There are multiple versions of some armor pieces for visual differences.
