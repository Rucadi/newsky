 The Wolf Leather Armor strikes a perfect balance between defense and weight. Skyforge steel fittings help the armor withstand the toughest blows while the supple leather provides exceptional flexibility. Both of these elements are perfect for members of The Circle who prefer a more agile approach to combat

The armor can be crafted at the Skyforge after helping the companions find the first fragment of Wuuthrad.
  
  
The armor has about the same stats as elven, but is cheaper to craft and is lighter.
  
  
Also included in the mod is a SPID file that should (Hopefully) distribute the armor to Aela.
