[Regular Stormcloak version here.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/113728)﻿
  
  
Main file is 3BA.
  
TBD CBPC Bodyslide files by [90bxt](https://forums.nexusmods.com/profile/194252735-90bxt/)﻿ in optional files.
  
  
Based on vanilla, [Sunjeongs Tawoba 6.1](https://www.sunjeongskyrimse.com/post/the-amazing-world-of-bikini-armors-remastered-6-0)﻿, and my [edits to it](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/111200)﻿.
  
Squeeze extra sliders same as in [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/110039)﻿.
  
Special mention, Stormcloak hdt cape is based on [Fuse00 Inquisitor Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73980)﻿, and [3ba conversion from kpvw](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74162)﻿.
  
(at the time of writing this, they had open permissions)﻿﻿

**Installation:**1. Install with your mod manager.
  
2. Search and Batch build in Bodyslide "*TIWOBA sons*".﻿
  
  
Done.
  
  
3. (optional) Build tops with extra sliders.
  
Some of these you can batch build (they share the same sliders), after you have set up the sliders for both 0 and 100 weight.
  
  
Instructions:
  
top 1: set up sliders, batch build with tops 1, 2, 3, 4
  
top 5: set up sliders, batch build with 5, 6
  
top 7: set up slider, batch build with 7, 8
  
  
Overwriting:
  
  
This includes xml files from Fuses Inquisitor armor, and from Tawoba 6.1,
  
that the loincloths, and the cape uses (if you don't have those installed).
  
They are exactly the same as in those mods, so overwrite or not if you want.
  
  
Also this includes Enviromental masks for the Sons Of Talos textures, that are absent from vanilla game.
  
If there is a conflict with your texture replacer, you can go either way,
  
but I would first test how it looks with the ones the texture replacer comes with.
  
  
Nothing else should conflict.
  
  
**Extra ramblings:**
  
  
Esl is called TAWOBA\_sons.esp.
  
  
The two HDT capes use textures that you have installed at:
  
textures\architecture\windhelm\sonsofskyrimfancybanner.dds
  
  
**Armor rating/gold value** I tried to balance to what it would be if wearing vanilla Stormcloak Officer set.
  
Boots, gloves, and head piece have same values as vanilla, rest of the modular pieces come close to what vanilla torso is.
  
  
The bear helmet included is same as vanilla, but you can wear circlets with it.
  
  
Can be crafted at forge (requires crafting book in inventory), tempered at armor bench.
  
Optional [BOS](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805?tab=description)﻿ file that adds the crafting book to Palace of Kings.
  
  
As stated above, this uses Stormcloak textures you have installed, for reference to my preview pictures, I'm using [Guards and Stormcloaks Armors Retexture SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98115?tab=files)﻿.
  
  
Let me know if I made mistake somewhere, or missed something obvious.
  
Thank you.
