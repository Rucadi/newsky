This is a conversion of the mod [Armors of Dragon Champion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/67127)﻿by [davjes](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/davjes/about-me?gameId=110) ported to SSE and updated to CBBE 3BA
  
  
 This is yet another excellent mod by davjes, ported at the request of a small group of individuals. My intention was to utilize this mod as a means to enhance various skills, and I have made some meager progress in that regard. Thus, we find ourselves here.

- Known Issues -
  
 I’ve been working on this mod for quite some time, but I hit a roadblock while trying to incorporate SMP into the Skirt, which was in dire need of it. I struggled to create an appealing version of the skirt with SMP, so I decided to eliminate the cloth component from the mesh entirely. I **STRONGLY** suggest using the Edited version of the skirt in BodySlide. I hope to eventually add SMP to the skirt once I learn, or perhaps someone will create a patch, the original version remains available for anyone interested.
  
  
 This armor has a TON of pieces so I can't imagine I got every bit of clipping, if you find any issues post it in the bugs section and I'll get to work on it!

If anyone wants to make a SMP patch let me know so I can add the link to the description
  
I had an 8K version, but it was over 10 GBs and I felt like nobody would want to download such a large file size
  
Was far more work than I anticipated so just glad I can move on from it (again)
  
if you want to upload your Screenshots feel free as I'm NOT a Screen Archer
