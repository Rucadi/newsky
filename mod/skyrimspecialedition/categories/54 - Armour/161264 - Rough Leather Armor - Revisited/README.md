# Rough Leather Armor - Revisited

The Rough Leather Armor is honestly one of my favorite armor mods for Skyrim. It fits perfectly with the game's aesthetics while still having a unique and realistic look to it.
  
  
This is my take of the mod, providing both the dark and the brown version in your game at the same time. The "Default Stats" version has the same stats as the original mod, providing armor rating between scaled and glass armors. I felt this was quite high for this armor, so the "Balanced Stats" version brings the armor rating down to scaled tier, except for the hood which provides less armor but only weighs one unit.
  
  
The only way to get the armor is to craft it with the Advanced Armors perk, as I didn't want to clutter any merchant loot tables. Maybe someone can make a SPID file for it.

Xavbio's patch in [Leather Armors Retexture SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90153) works with this version as well, however it only covers the dark version as far as I can tell.
