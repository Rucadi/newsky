A new craftable light ebony armor accompanied by a unique crossbow, bolts
  
and cosmetic Witcher themed swords.
  
  
• The swords are wearable by both male and female characters/companions
  
  
~ the swords are mirrored compared to the normal greatsword placement but that
  
was done on purpose for aesthetic reasons in case you equip a crossbow as well ~
  
  
The armor has similar stats with Dragonscale.
  
The crossbow is a bit more powerful than vanilla crossbows.
  
  
There are two armor versions you can craft,
  
one without a skirt and one with a nice skirt for a more SFW look.
  
  
There are three types of bolts available.
  
• Normal Bolt (normal damage to health)
  
• Fire Bolt (with explosive fire damage to health)
  
• Shock Bolt (with *[font=Times New Roman]explosive shock damage to health and mana)[/font]*
  
  
• Quivers Bonus
  
25% more Bow/Crossbow damage
  
100 more carry weight
  
  
• Swords Bonus
  
Destruction magic spells cost 25% less mana
  
  
All other items can be enchanted normally.

This outfit started as a theme for Witch Hunter armor but very quickly spun
  
out of control with every texture reworked, new meshes, more options like
  
the skirt, swords and different types of bolts.
  
  
  
Every single texture on this outfit from the color to the height maps was hand painted in Photoshop.
  
The outfit was made using Photoshop, Crazy Bump, Outfit Studio and Nifscope.
  
  
  
All the recipes will only be available as long as you carry the crafting manual in your inventory.
  
When you are done crafting store the manual and your crafting interface will be free again.
