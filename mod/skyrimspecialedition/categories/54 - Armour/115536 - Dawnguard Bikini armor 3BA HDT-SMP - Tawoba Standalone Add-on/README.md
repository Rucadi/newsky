**Extra ramblings:**
  
  
Esps (light) are called TAWOBA\_dawn.esp, and TAWOBA\_Dawn\_Heavy.esp.
  
  
The HDT cape, loincloths, and leggings B uses texture that you have installed at:
  
textures\dlc01\architecture\dawnguard\dbanner01.dds, and normal maps from generic banner 1.
  
I used this replacer personally in older previews (black cloak): [Ennead Banners](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10564)﻿.
  
For 2.0 previews I use this (Grey cloaks): [Rally's Banners of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/116289)﻿
  
Some circlets and amulet pieces in 2.0 use DG hammer textures.
  
Thigh 5 piece, the scroll uses scroll textures you have installed, I use: [Realistic Paper Parchment](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44223?)﻿.
  
  
**Armor rating/gold value** I tried to balance to what it would be if wearing vanilla light Dawnguard set.
  
Boots, gloves, and head piece have same values as vanilla, rest of the modular pieces come close to what vanilla torso is.
  
Same thing for Heavy version, should be close to vanilla.
  
  
Can be crafted at forge, tempered at armor bench.
  
Requires Crafting book in inventory for them to show up in crafting menu.
  
Light and Heavy versions have separate books.
  
See bottom sticky for more detailed info.
  
  
  
As stated above, this uses Dawnguard textures you have installed, for reference to my preview pictures, I'm using the excellent [FranklyHD Dawnguard Armor and Weapons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19663?)﻿.
  
  
Let me know if I made mistake somewhere, or missed something obvious.
  
Thank you.
