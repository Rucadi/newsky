﻿The Primal Dragonslayer Armor hails from an era long forgotten.
  
The Dragonborn felt a whisper hailing from High Hrothgar.
  
A blueprint to create this armor fell through the time wound and ended up in the present time.

This plugin has been created with the most recent version of the creation kit, if you are on a game version earlier than 1.6.1130 I recommend you use [BEES](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441) otherwise your game will crash or wont start. If you dont wanna use that mod you have to set the version of the .esp in SSEdit from 1.71 to 1.70.
  
  
Install using your favourite mod manager.
  
  
There are two options for the textures:
  
**Complex Material**Spoiler
  
Requirements: ENB or [Community Shaders](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86492)
  
  
**ENB** users on a recent version like 0.499, have to set
  
EnableComplexMaterial=true and EnableDynamicCubemap=true.
  
If these are greyed out in your ingame ENB control panel you have to set them manually in your enbseries.ini located in your Skyrim folder.
  
**Community Shader** users have to use [Dynamic Cubemaps](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/112763) and [Complex Parallax Materials](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/95134?tab=description).
  
**Standard Material**
  
If you dont use ENB and Community Shaders you have to use this option in the installer.
  
  
You have to build the outfit in Body Slide.
  
  
Safe to install mid-save.
  
  
Default texture resolution is 2k, higher resolutions are found under optional files. I personally recommend 4k.
