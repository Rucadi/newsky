DEATHBRAND - My version
  
KONUNGR GAAF Armor
  
By Xtudo**
  
**Description**
  
**A badass replacer for the Deathbrand Armor, and the new Konungr Gaaf standalone heavy armor set.**
  

  
* 20 new items.
Male and female versions.
  
* Weight sliders.
Three colors available.
  
* One handed and two handed swords.
Defensive dagger (works as a shield).
  
* An armored Cloak.
You can craft all the items at any forge, and you can temper them too.
  
* 4K and 2K versions.
No HDT required.
  
* Full support for beast races.
Survival "warm" keyword added.
  
* BSA. ESL.

  
* The **Deathbrand Armor** continues with the same stats (light armor and same enchantments), the changes are only aesthetic. I know it is not made of Stalhrim anymore, I don't like crystal armors, so I made this version for me.

  
* The heavy **Konungr Gaaf Armor** has stats sightly superior to the heavy Stalhrim Armor. I also added it to the leveled lists, it will only appear on high levels and it will be very rare.

  
Oh, I totally forgot to mention it, KONUNGR means **KING** in the old Nord language, and GAAF means **GHOST** in the awesome Skyrim Dragon tongue.
  
  
**Optional files**
  

  
* **Only the Deathbrand Armor replacer**.
**Only the Konungr Gaaf Armor set**. Weapons included.
  
* **Helmets Spikes Addon**. Only textures. 4K, 2K versions available. Requires one of the Main files installed first.
**Legacy of the Dragonborn SSE (LOTD) patch.** Fully compatible with v6.
