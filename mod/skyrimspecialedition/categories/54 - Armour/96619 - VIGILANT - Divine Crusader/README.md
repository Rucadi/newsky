Replace Pelinal's weapon with a bloody variant of Chrysamere.

Bloody variants' stats are similar to CC's Divine Crusader and Chrysamere but -3AR for armor, -2AR for the rest, -2 damage for weapons.
  
Place two dead Knights of the Nine close to Pelinal. You can find rest of bloody variants on them.
  
Reforge bloody version to normal version. For example, with 5 daedra heart and amulet of each divine, you can forge the normal version of Crusader set.
  
Covers all items from Divine Crusader and Chrysamere.

I know Pelinal never wield Chrysamere, but it fits his art style.
