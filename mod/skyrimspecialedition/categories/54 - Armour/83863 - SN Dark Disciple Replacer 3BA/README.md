Roughly 2 years while looking through Tullius I stumbled upon [this mod](https://arca.live/b/tullius/27929616?category=%EC%9D%98%EC%83%81&target=all&keyword=Dark+Disciple&p=1)﻿, a SE 3BA version of the [Dark Disciple](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/42398?tab=description) made as a replacer for The Dark Brotherhood, and retextured. Of course, it was never in English so even when downloading it, the text was nothing but squares. Today I managed to take it and Translate it from Korean to English.
  
  
[바람둥이쏘닉(Flirt Sonic)](https://arca.live/b/tullius/27929616?category=%EC%9D%98%EC%83%81&target=all&keyword=Dark+Disciple&p=1), The one responsible for the retexture, and [betterbecause](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/42398?tab=description) for the LE Version. Of Course, the credit also goes to whomever the mod Authors have given credit for. This Version changes from the original except for the names. Please Note that any issues you have regarding the textures Are nothing in relation to me - this is only the translation of the names and the items' descriptions.
  
  
  
  
However, there are a few things to note:
  
1. There are 2 rings the author has added. The Night Waver's Ring (00068B83) Requires you to spawn the item using console commands. The second ring, Is the collision ring that is supposed to be used along with the Wig included with the mod. The Description states that it is supposed to keep Astrid's Hair from getting buried in her ass, But I am unsure if it is also supposed to add physics to it.The ring to my understanding seems to do nothing at the moment and the wig will end up clipping in the butt if your character looks upward. the ring and the wig may require the "B&B NPC Replacer" but it seems to have vanished from the internet so I cannot be sure.
  
  
2. The Maskless Cowl is Invisible, though it seems from the description the author intended for it be just a mask (I could be wrong on this). I am unsure of this as the mod has not been updated since 9/9/2021. You can still add a mask by using AddItem menu to go to "SN Dark Disciple" and add one from there. Though you will have to add an enchantment yourself.
  
  
  
Also, thank you to CallMeMoon for helping me make sure everything was translated correctly!
