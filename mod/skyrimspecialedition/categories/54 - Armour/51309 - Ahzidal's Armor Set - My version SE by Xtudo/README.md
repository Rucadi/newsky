Ahzidal's Armor Set - My version
  
By Xtudo

Description**
  
**Replaces the Ahzidal's Armor Set from the Dragonborn DLC, with a new version (2K and 4K). It includes a new shield too.
  
The Legacy of the Dragonborn version is optional (100% compatible with LOTD v6).**
  
  
I was a bit disappointed to see that the armor visuals are the same that the vanilla Ancient Nord armor. As I use it everyday, especially the boots, I did a lore-friendly replacer for me.
  
  
You can craft the shield at any forge, it requires the Advanced Smithing perk. And you can enchant/temper it too.
  
  
ESP flagged as ESL.  The mod carries-on the USSEP fixes to the armor too.
  
  
The model is from the awesome [Heavy Nordic Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/98624) by NordWarUA.
  
  
**I made it for my game and now I'm sharing it, I hope you like it. :)**
