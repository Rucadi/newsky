My version of the Elvenia armor set originally by [gutris1](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/80615). Shall we call this Elvenia 2025?
  
  
Specific changes:
  
Pieces separated out so they can be equipped and unequipped separately, some new pieces created from the same assets, added SMP to the belly tassels thing, and a variety of zap sliders and adjustment sliders. The pieces that you'd expect to have physics all have SMP physics now, yay!
  
  
This is partially based on kahvipannu84's 3BA version with squeeze sliders and weights, so this inherits all of the changes made there along with the original SE Kalessin42 3BA version that it's based on. Here I made some more uv, weights, and slider changes of my own, made some new pieces with the assets, and also brought those features to BHUNP because the cult of BHUNP graciously tests and takes screenshots for me.
  
  
This version also uses custom textures from xavbio instead of the vanilla elven armor textures. See credits.
  
  
This version is standalone thanks to the permissions of the previous iterations of this outfit.
  
  
esl flagged esp. Use additemmenu, or there are actually crafting recipes this time as well that requires elven smithing. Build with bodyslide first.
  
  
**Requirements:**
  
CBBE 3BA or BHUNPv4
