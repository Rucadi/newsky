***﻿Description***

  
  
The mod adds heavy armor "Runes of Roots" in the style of "[Runes of Thorns](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/127085?tab=posts&jump_to_comment=145400850)".
  
The armor consists of 8 elements.
  
The armor's characteristics are slightly superior to those of ebony.
  
There are silver and gold-plated versions in black and white.
  
The skirt uses FSMP
  
  
You can create armor in 2 ways.
  
The main method of creation requires the presence of ebony smithing.
  
However, there are rumors that a group of the last of the rune guards were spotted near Windhelm Near water and trees. Perhaps they left some clues that will allow you to create armor ahead of time.
