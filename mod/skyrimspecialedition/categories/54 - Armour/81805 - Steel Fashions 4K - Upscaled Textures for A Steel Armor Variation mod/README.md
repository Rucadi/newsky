# Steel Fashions 4K - Upscaled Textures for A Steel Armor Variation mod
- Author: GolinskiRH - XilaMonstrr
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

The original textures were a mix of 512, 1K, 2K and 4K resolution. I upscaled them using [chaiNNer](https://github.com/chaiNNer-org) and [ESRGAN models](https://upscale.wiki/wiki/Model_Database), and re-compressed in [modern BC7 format](https://www.reedbeta.com/blog/understanding-bcn-texture-compression-formats/) with full mipmaps to a max of 4K resolution.

Performance Option for Potato PCs
  
Mipmaps and BC7 compression reduce VRAM usage, especially when the files are cleaned of compression artifacts.
  
For Potato PCs, I've uploaded a downscaled version where the diffuse texture files are larger than normal and environment map files, which are less visible in game. This reduces VRAM usage considerably while maintaining higher visual quality, using the [Octagon config files posted on this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68055), which I recommend using if you have a Potato PC.

We know from experience that modding is an extremely addictive past-time and can be a slippery slope from creating a simple load order to porting mods to going full boat and attempting to rebuild Skyrim from the ground up. That's why we believe in a community that integrates Xbox and PC gamers along with porting noobs and experienced mod authors. We all have more to learn, and modding Skyrim to its extreme is a community effort to say the least.
