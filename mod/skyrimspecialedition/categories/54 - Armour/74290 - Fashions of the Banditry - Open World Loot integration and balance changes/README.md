Fashions of the Banditry is one of the highest quality armor pack you can find on nexus. It fits fully seamlessly into the world. But I personally don't really agree with how they are distributed, so I made this mod.
  
  
Armor stats have been adjusted where needed to make sense within Skyrim armor tier system. Distribution has been adjusted so now all armors will start to appear based on their tier, which means no more high-end troll ossuary set spawning on level 1.
  
  
Troll Ossuary Set:
  

  
* Stats similar to chitin heavy tier
Appears at level 25
  

Assembled Dwarven Armor:
  

  
* Nerfed from dwarven to bonemold tier (armor made from scrap shouldn't be as good as real dwarven armor)
Appears at level 10
  

Troll Hide:
  

  
* Slightly better leather set
Appears at level 7
  

Steel Set:
  

  
* Steel set exactly matches steel tier, steel trimmed armor is weaker
Appears at level 6
  

Fur Dwemer:
  

  
* Nerfed from dwarven to bonemold tier (armor made from scrap shouldn't be as good as real dwarven armor)
Appears at level 10
  

Scrapped Draugr:
  

  
* Slightly better fur set
Draugr helmets are imperial light tier
  
* Appears at level 1

Draugr Leather:
  

  
* Slightly better leather set
Appears at level 6
  

  
Bandit bosses wear default OWL armor (iron/steel/steel plate) to avoid jarring armor mismatch.
