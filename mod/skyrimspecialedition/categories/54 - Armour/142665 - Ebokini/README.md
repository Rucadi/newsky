Ebony bikini. My version of the Ebokini set originally by gutris1.

Specific changes:
  
  
Pieces separated out so they can be equipped and unequipped separately, and a variety of zap sliders and adjustment sliders. Added SMP to the earrings, and the two scarf pieces also have SMP rigged to separate bones and can move independently of each other, look at the screenshots for some cool examples.
  
  
This is a direct conversion from Oldrim based on the [original gutris1 mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/77070). There are no new pieces this time because the original permissions precluded any mashups. The crossbow is not included here either because the permissions says I can't.
  
  
This version uses custom ebony textures from xavbio instead of the vanilla textures. There's also two recolor texture variants available as optional downloads.
  
  
esl flagged esp. Use additemmenu, or there are crafting recipes that require ebony smithing. Build with bodyslide first.
  
  
Requirements:
  
CBBE 3BA or BHUNPv4
  
Bodyslide
  
FSMP﻿
  
Racemenu
