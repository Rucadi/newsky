This patch adds cloth physics to the Daedric Armor(Creation Club Version).
  
  
Require **ccbgssse050-ba\_daedric.esl** and **ccbgssse050-ba\_daedric.bsa**.
  
  
Also require **HDT-SMP (Skinned Mesh Physics)** OR **FSMP - Faster HDT-SMP**.
  
  
  
**【2023.1.16 upgrade】
  
  
Adding weight 0 to weight 100 vanilla bodyshape change support. (This will be supported on all my physical patches, just need some time.)
  
Now you can change the body weight, and the size of armor will also change.
  
Support vanilla body, no need for any MOD bodyshape.
  
  
Delete all previous files and replace by this version directly.
  
It's safe to update mid-game.
  
But don't wear this armor to save and load game.
