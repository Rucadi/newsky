The [Stormhold Warrior Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/95661)﻿ by SoN6of6TrediS is one of my favorite armors to use for Argonians, as I love the ESO cinematic Argonian designs.

*So* cool.

  
  
Anyways, this is a port of the mod plus some fixes, tweaks, and addons. There is another port of this mod found **[here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38752)**, which is a direct port if you're interested in that.
  
**Fixes**
  
**Weight scaling:** the original mod did not have 0-weight meshes, leading to a gap between the body and the neck at anything under 100 weight. I've added a low-weight mesh for everything, so it now scales correctly.
  
  
**Vanilla body support:** the original mod used a much larger male body mesh than the Vanilla maximum. I've edited it to match the 100 weight Vanilla body, so you won't instantly grow huge when putting on the armor.
  
**1st person glove meshes:** the original didn't have 1st person meshes that worked with the gloves- I've added 1st person meshes to the gloves, so you won't be missing hands

[/size]**Tweaks**
  
**New names**: Renamed armor pieces to 'Saxhleel Leather'
  
  
**ESPFE**
  
  
**Separate gloves:** the original had the gloves built into the armor- I've made them separate armor pieces
  
  
**2k, 1k textures:** the original has 4k textures, which I've included in the main file. I've added new optional files for 2k or 1k textures. All textures have been converted to BC7 (aka optimized.)
  
  
**Beast claws:** I've added separate gloves for Beast races with claws.
  
  
**Removes distribution:** for better compatibility with other mods, I've removed the sack from the Sanctuary and the outfit from Veezara. The outfit records and sack still exist, and have been updated to include the new armor versions for modders' use
  
  
**Craftable and temperable:** added crafting and tempering, based around Vanilla leather armor. It's stronger than its leather counterparts because it has only the two pieces and no vanilla boots work with the pants without clipping. It's also not enchantable.
  
  
**Inventory models:** added new meshes for the inventory/world models.

**New variants:** I've added three new variants- Left Pauldron, Right Pauldron, and No Pauldrons.
  
**Female Armor:** original mod was male only, I've added a female version. I've also covered my new variants.
  
**CBBE Bodyslides** (Optional): My first attempt at making a bodyslide
  
**Female Hands Redone - CBBE** (Optional): uses [Female Hands Redone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90713) mesh/sliders for the gauntlets

Patches[/size]
  
Please let me know if you make a patch, I'll add a link here!
  
  
If you like this port, please consider downloading the original mod and endorsing it!
  
  
**Known Issues**
  

  
* 1st person male non-beast race gloves have arms clipping through the upper part of the glove
Weighting on the glove's bones pieces is funky, they will bend with the arm
  
* arms clip a little through pauldrons with some animations

  
**I will NOT:**
  

  
* make any other body versions
add HDT
  
* distribute to NPCs
port to LE or Xbox
  
* add to merchants (though it would be perfect for Khajiit caravans and the Dawn's Venture from Wares of Tamriel)

  
**Permissions**
  
Okay to make patches/mesh replacers based on my meshes (for body types) on mods receiving no donations. Must require my plugin, do not include my plugin in your mod. Please credit properly as well.
  
  
Translations are 100% okay.
  
  
Do **NOT** publish this mod as-is on any other sites (LL, VP, etc.)
  
  
Anything else, just ask, I'm quick to answer.
