Vanilla Bandits are very lackluster in terms of armor variety. this lore friendly armor pack changes that. Each set has like 3 varieties.
  
 ﻿Bodyslides for CBBE,CBBE 3BA and HIMBO are available. All armors are craftable and can also be found being worn by bandits.
  
  
 ﻿This mod contains:
  
  

  
* Crude Steel Armor - Mostly furs and some parts of a scrapped steel armor. can be crafted and comes in 3 variations. Normal, Robed and Trimmed, as well as 3 helmet variations.
Bandit Assembled Dwarven Armor- sometimes bandits hang around dwarven ruins, a bandit may very well decide to incorporate a few of the dwarven scraps he found laying around into his armor for some extra defense. two variations of cuirass.
  
* Draugr Scrap Armor- same logic as the dwarven one but with draugrs, 3 variations of cuirass and 4 variations of helmet.
Troll Hide Cuirass - Bandits usually live in caves, and you know what also lives in caves? trolls. Its perfectly believable that someone should be able to make an armor with the hide of a troll. has both a Cave and Mountain troll variant. Trolls now drop troll hide, wich can also be turned into leather.
  
* Troll Ossuary Cuirass- Ah yes, the poor man's dragonbone. Made mostly of troll bones, in similar fashion to a bonemold armor. its crafting uses a new ingredient, the Ossuary Paste, wich can be crafted from a troll skull,troll fat and spriggan sap.
