Thank you for viewing this mod. This mod was initially my answer to Nolvus V6's Armor Mashup which lacked a male version. However, I thought I'd share it on nexus for everyone's use!  However, for best experience, be sure to use it with Nolvus V6!╰(▔∀▔)╯
  
  
To note, this is my first ever mod so please be gentle... And I hope you'll like it!（ꉺ౪ꉺ）
  
  
Install like you would like with any other mod. Requires FSMP - Faster HDT-SMP for physics for the armor and cloak. 
  
  
**Armor Details:**A set of a custom hooded helmet, a generic 3 piece heavy armor set that comes included with a long leather tasset with physics, two scarf variants and lastly two cloak variants or a shoulder cape depending on your preference. The armor set comes in Steel, Orichalcum, Corundum, Dwemer, Silver, Ebony (Two variants), Daedric and Dragonplate.
  
  
**How to Get:**The armor sets can be crafted at the forge once you unlock the relevant smithing perks:
  
  
Steel Smithing: For the steel variant
  
Orcish Smithing: For the Orichalcum variant
  
Elven Smithing: For the Corundum variant
  
Dwarven Smithing: For the Dwemer variant
  
Glass Smithing: For the Silver variant
  
Ebony Smithing: For the Ebony variants
  
Daedric Smithing: For the Meteoric variant
  
Dragon Smithing: For the Raven variant
  
  
The scarves, belts, cloak and cape can be crafted at the tanning rack. Or optionally, use add item menu/modex/additem console commands ("help blacksted") if you swing that way... I won't judge (˵ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°˵)
  
  
**Armor Lore:**Lore? My goodness my good man do we need it? ....Yes....? ⊙▽⊙
  
  
This armor was initially designed by everyone's favorite Dwemechanic (I hope so...) Remiel for her husband Revan Blacksted after he showed her plans to an armor set he acquired after finishing a bounty from High Rock. With this newfound knowledge and knowing her husband's tendencies for hunting vampires and werewolves stealthily (not another stealth archer...) in Falkreath, she designed the armor to be made with silver and dwarven metal along with some innovative use of foam padding made from moonstone powder to dampen the sound the armor makes.
  
  
Expecting her husband to be ecstatic at his new shiny armor set, he however quipped playfuly, "Remi... You know they call me the Raven of Falkreath, yes?" Furrowing her eyebrows while looking at all the black armor sets in her husband's collection, speaking under her breath "...let me guess..." Revan then hastily interrupted, "*...does it come in black?*" 
  
  
After vehemently refusing to reforge the armor black, Revan with all his might shouted "YOL TOR SHUL!" at the armor and charred it completely black and...also broke it. A frustrated Remi then gave up and made an armor in Ebony to which Revan approved of, but then pointing to his damaged Magna-Ge's Bane armor, "You could salvage parts from that armor and further improve this armor, can't you darling?" After many many many other unwanted requests from Revan, Remi gave up and just planted dragonscales and infused the metals with grinded and charred black dragonbones.
  
  
"IS THIS BLACK ENOUGH FOR YOU?!" she screamed at Revan at the top of her lungs. Revan while unplugging his ears with his fingers smiled, "Perfect my dear..."
  
  
Remi releasing a breath of relief wipes the sweat on her forehead but felt a tap on her shoulder from behind. Turning around to find Kellie the Dragonborn and her party going, "we want some of that :D"
  
  
".............NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!" 
  
  
The End (˵ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°˵) 
  
  
***Enjoy Remi's hard work?...***

**Known Issues:**~~1. Mod author is a Remiel simp~~2. Classic Ebony helmet's colors are off despite right texture addresses
  
  
Please inform me if you find any other issues with the mod and I'll try to fix it.
  
  
**To do list:**
  
1. Proper non-HDT-SMP Version
  
2. Add lowered hood (planned for v2.1)
  
3. Add a skimpier version for the female edition (think Zettai Ryouiki), along with a true to a certain dark lord version for the boys :P (planned for v2.1)
