Disclaimer: This mod does not improve anything, it's simply different take on Steel Fashions implementation.
  
  
Summary:
  

  
* Changes name of two armor sets
Rebalances armor rating, weight, and value to make sense within vanilla armor tier system
  
* Changes crafting requirements where needed
Patches NPC changes for OWL
  
* Distributes armor sets with OWL leveled lists to NPCs
Distributes armor sets to vendors
  
* (Optional) Distributes armor sets to loot chests

  
**[size=4]Royal Steel Armor - Steel Plate Tier**
  
Name suggests it's some rare regal armor, so I would have to limit it to few NPCs, which would be a waste. So I have decided to rename it to **Cyrodiilic Steel Plate Armor**, so it's now more reasonable to just distribute it as one of steel plate variants. Slightly adjusted weight and value to make it more consistent.
  
  
**Berserker Steel Armor - Steel Tier**Nerfs to weight and armor rating. Weaker but lighter variant of steel armor. Distributed as steel variant.
  
  
**Duskplate Steel Armor - Steel Plate Tier**Adjusted weight to match steel plate tier, increased price. Distributed as steel plate variant.
  
  
**Ignoble Steel Armor - Steel Tier**Moved from steel plate to steel tier, added crafting requirements.
  
Renamed to **Bretonic Mercenary Steel Armor**. Heavier, but more powerful steel variant, perfect for tank builds. Distributed as common steel variant.
  
High Rock borders with Skyrim, so let's assume that it's common. I don't want to make it rare, because otherwise NPCs would wear vanilla steel or barbarian steel, now there are 3 possible options.
  
Open faced helmet not distributed to NPCs to avoid hair clipping.
  
  
**Alik'r Steel Armor - Steel Tier**Moved from steel plate to steel tier, changed crafting requirements.
  
Values the same as steel armor. Distributed the same as original mod + added to OWL Alik'r leveled lists so basically any Alik'r warrior can wear it.
  
  
Most NPC changes reverted and patched for OWL, except for Redguard NPCs.
  
  
Location Aware Container Loot addon distributes them as loot to bandit camps and vampire lairs (makes sense I think, vampires can store loot from their victims). All common except Alik'r Steel which has been distributed to epic tier.
