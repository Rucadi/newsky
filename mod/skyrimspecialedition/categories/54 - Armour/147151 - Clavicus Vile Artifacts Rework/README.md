• Cruel Illusion: Summons an illusory Rueful Axe from your position. It will attack the enemy autonomously, causing a lesser <Rueful Cut> effect with each attack, but only dealing half the damage.

• Babas's Friendship: Offering <20> gold to Vile, summons a clone of Babas, the dog that summons Clavicus Vile, to fight for you. It cannot be harmed, and its bite will slow down and unbalance enemies, as well as control weaker summons. Use it again to dispel it. Cooldown <20> seconds. (The AI ​​of creatures is not that smart. If you find that it is not following you, please sneak a bit and update the AI.)

• Evil Contract: Offering <500> gold to Vile, sending out a Whispering Blast that brainwashes a non-hostile target with a level lower than or equal to your current level, making it your follower, improving your relationship, unlocking follower dialogue (does not count towards normal follower limit), the affected target gains <300> armor and <30%> magic resistance, and is protected so that it can only be killed by you, using an skill again or talking to it to remove the brainwash, <can only have one brainwashed target>. Cooldown <100> seconds.
  
  
(This is a skill that requires timing, and should not be used on NPCs who are on important missions. If used properly, you can even brainwash the Ebony Warrior, provided you can play to level 81.)

• Trickery Shift : Offering <200> gold to Vile, release a red light at the target you are aiming at. Immediately teleport, swapping your position with the target. If you hit an ally, reduce the damage they take by <50%>, and allow them to <taunt enemies> and attract attacks (when the ally's health is below 40%, they will not attract attacks), which lasts for <30> seconds. If you hit an enemy, increase the damage they take by <80%>, apply the Frenzy effect, and allow them to <taunt enemies> and attract attacks, which lasts for <30> seconds.

(The cooldown effect of all skills is universal. If the cooldown effect of a skill has not ended, all skills cannot be used.)
  
  
  
Also, a Illusory Horn horn version of the Vile Mask has been added, for those who think this thing can’t be made beautiful (including me).When you have the normal version of Vile Mask, you can convert to Illusory Horn at the Skyforge.Of course, since it is an Illusory Horn, it can't provide armor value, but the skills and enchantments are completely inherited.

Barbas also has a new unique skin with horns on his head, red eyes, grayer, larger, and a Edit appearance including the one for the quest.
