This mod adds a standalone heavy armor set and two handed greatsword inspired by Medieval Fantasy.
  
  
The armor and greatsword all share the exact same stats and recipes as vanilla Ebony armor, which means you craft them at a forge under the Ebony section! (Or use console commands/[AddItemMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17563))
  
  
Armor in game is named ''Yaldabaoth [Armor Piece]''. Weapon is ''Yaldabaoth Greatsword''.
  
  
[HDT-SMP version can be downloaded here!](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/104782) Males and Females have custom meshes. Textures are all 4K Resolution! 
  
  
There are 3 main files for this mod. The ***Divine Version*** will make your armor appear how it does in the screenshots titled ***Divine Version***. The ***Darkend Version*** will make the armor how it appears in the screenshots titled ***Darkend Version*.** (Inspired by the mod [**Darkend**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10423), user request) The ***Render** **Version***will make the armor how it appears in the screenshots titled ***Render Version***. The only visual difference between the ***Darkend, Divine***and ***Render***versions are the textures.
