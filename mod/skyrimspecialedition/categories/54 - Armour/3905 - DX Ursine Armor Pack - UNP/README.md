 Ursine Armor Pack contains three craftable armors. Imperial, Stormcloak and Barbarian. All have a variety of customization options and can be upgraded using the workbench. Their stats are equal to scale armor plus some extra protection from a few extra parts.

 This is the first mod of a series that will contain eight armors with three variations each. I came up with the idea when I saw the Minidresses Collection mod by Tiwa44 who did an awesome job converting some of the long dresses to mini versions. So I started experimenting with his meshes to see if it's possible to convert them into mini armors and I came up with some very creative results.
  
  
 These armors will not offer any protection in real life so don't use them at home! Also some variations may be sexy-mini-tiny-skimpy.
  
  
 There is no guarantee that I will finish all the armors but the creation has been fun so far and as long as I'm excited about this project I'll keep working on it until hopefully all armors are complete.
  
  
Below are the eight different mini dresses by Tiwa44 and the progress I'm making with the armors. I'll update the image every time something major changes. Also I came up with the names (with the help of a generator) and to my knowledge they are not used by anyone else.
