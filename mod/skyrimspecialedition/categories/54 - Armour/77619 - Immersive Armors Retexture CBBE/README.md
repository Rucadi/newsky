yes, this mod requires the [original CBBE for Immersive Armors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22382) <3 I don't have the time or energy to remake *everything.* Besides! Jeir has assured me that she is updating her version! So be sure to check that out and endorse her mod! I used, like, three of her meshes after asking politely. 
  
  
Pick and choose which armor you will be using! You can load [Immersive Armors - Realistic Armor Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36746) after mine. Prebuilt meshes are currently not included, so you can only build the ones that you want. (Requires BodySlide)
