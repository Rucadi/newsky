ABOUT THE MOD
  
Skyrim in the fourth era is occupied by the undead and daedra worshipers. Such situation in the Province attracts not only adventurers, but also fanatics of the nine, monster hunters and grim champions of endless war with necromancy. The relics of one of them are still kept as a trophy in the **Reachcliff Cave** in the northwest.
  
  
Author's note:
  
> I've always felt that the Arkay/Orkay worshiping is underplayed a bit in the game, considering the amount of restless undead around. On the other hand, light armor quickly starts to look like heavy armor, but in brighter colors. So I started working on this set of light armor for the defender of the peace of the dead, with the knot of Arkay on one shoulder, and the serpent, symbol of Orkay among the Nords, on the other. I hope you will enjoy the mod as much as I enjoyed making it.
