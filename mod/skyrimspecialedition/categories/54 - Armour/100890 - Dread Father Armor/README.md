# Dread Father Armor
- Author: Chakra SSE

- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/100890


This mod adds a standalone custom made armor set inspired by Necromancy.
  
  
The armor shares the exact same stats and recipes as vanilla Orcish armor, which means you craft them at a forge under the Orcish section! (Or use console commands/[AddItemMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17563))
  
  
Armor in game is named ''Dread Father [Armor Piece]''. 
  
  
No HDT SMP on this mod, Males and Females have custom meshes. Textures are all 4K Resolution! **If anyone wants there to be a HDT SMP version, message me and we can discuss!**
