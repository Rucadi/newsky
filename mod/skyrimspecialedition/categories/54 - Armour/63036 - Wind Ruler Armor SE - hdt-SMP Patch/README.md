﻿I'll be brief. This patch adds hdt-SMP cloth physics to the Wind Ruler Armor (hair and skirt)
  
  
 **Merge this file with the original Wind Ruler Armor**
  
  
You will need [Skinned Mesh Physics](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30872)﻿ & [XPMSSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1988) To make physics works
  
  
  
Q&A
  
  
Q: Does it work with AE?
  
A: If you can get SMP to work on AE then yes
  
  
Q: I did a *supercool anime summersault strike* and skirt got stuck in the legs, help
  
A: reequip to reset physics, also try doing anime summersault irl while wearing a skirt and see how it goes.
