[font=Georgia]Glasses Pack Vol.1 is indeed a masterpiece. I was disappointed to find out that there was no SPID distribution for it. So here we are.
  
  
This is a SPID mod that distributes glasses to different NPCs in the vanilla game and Interesting NPCs mod. I've tried to pick NPCs who could potentially use glasses "immersively" - mages, scholars, apothecaries, and librarians. Please let me know if you have any ideas or suggestions for other NPCs who could benefit from this mod, and I'll add them.
  
  
  
*Please note that there's a little clipping here and there. It's more noticeable on male NPCs, so if it's not to your liking, just use the female NPCs only version (F). Alternatively, you can use the ALT version of my other distribution -*[*Gold and Silver Reading Glasses - SPID Distribution*](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/121290). ﻿*It will take care of male, elder, and beast NPCs.*
