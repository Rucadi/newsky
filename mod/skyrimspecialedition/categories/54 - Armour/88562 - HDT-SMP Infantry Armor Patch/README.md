**To my favorite MOD author.**
  
**4thUnknown**
  
**His works are worthy of praise in all words.**
  
  
  
Only some meshes files and esp *(flagged as esl, it is necessary, because I changed the armor addon for [i]weightslide*)[/i].
  
Require HDT-SMP (Skinned Mesh Physics) OR FSMP - Faster HDT-SMP.
  
Also require original mod.
  
Then use this patch to cover it.
  
  
  
I have tried my best to show the beauty of the armor.
  
  
  
  
  
  
**Thanks again to 4thUnknown for his amazing armor.**

【Something that you don't need to know, just enjoying the beauty of the armor.】

*I have added the weight 0 to weight 100 vanilla bodyshape change support.
  
See the picture for specific bodyshape changes.
  
[size=4]Support vanilla body, no need for any MOD bodyshape.
  
[i]Esp file flagged as esl. (Necessary, because I changed the armor addon.)
  
  
The original esp had a small bug regarding light helmet and heavy boots, their keywords were written incorrectly.
  
I guess this is because [i]4thUnknown* is too tired, making armor is a very tiring work.
  
I am also very anxious when I am about to complete any works, which often leads to some small mistakes :D

[size=4]**If you like my cloth physics and face replacers, you can support me on Patreon.
  
Or if you have other armor you like, you can also entrust me to make physical patch.
