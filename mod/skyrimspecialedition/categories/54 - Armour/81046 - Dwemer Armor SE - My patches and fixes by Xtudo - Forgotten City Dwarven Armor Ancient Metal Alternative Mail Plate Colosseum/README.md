**My patches and fixes by Xtudo**

**Description**
  
**Several patches for this wonderful armor made by 4thUnknown.**
  
  
**Version 2.0**
  

  
* Proper weight sliders for all the items.
Full beast races support.
  
* Reduced the size of the female pauldrons.
Reduced the width of the female skirt.
  
* Adjusted the size and position of the helmet, to better fit the ones of the head.
Mesh files moved to the "Meshes\1Dwemer" folder.
  
* Added crafting recipes, same requirements than the vanilla Dwarven Armor.
All armor pieces added to Dwarven leveled lists.
  
* Added Ancient Dwemer Metal patch.
Updated all patches with the new features and fixes.
  

  
**Fixes (v2.0)**
  

  
* ESP flagged as ESL.
Carried on the Unofficial Skyrim fixes.
  
* Added the "Warm" keyword to all the armor pieces, for the Survival mode.
The necklaces will be hidden by the cuirass.
  
* Test chest removed.
Reduced the price of items.
  
* Fixed floating helmets.
Fixed clipping and gaps.
  
* Fixed bone weights.
Mesh files now use their own cubemap texture file.
  
* It's fine to update mid-game.

  
**Optional downloads**
  

  
* **Optimized 2K textures**. Fixes the original **"Half Sized Textures"** optional file (missing mipmaps).
**Heavy and Light Armor version**. Adds a Light Armor version. Now there will be two Heavy Armor and two Light versions of the original four Heavy versions. Same stats than the Glass and Scale Armors.
  
* **Vanilla Dwarven Armor replacer.** Only meshes and textures. It's safe to install/uninstall it at any time.
**CC Alternative Armors - Dwarven Mail.** Only meshes and textures. It's safe to install/uninstall it at any time.
  
* **CC Alternative Armors - Dwarven Plate.** Only meshes and textures. It's safe to install/uninstall it at any time.
**Renamed to "Cyrodiilic Dwarven"** (Miscellaneous files). Based on the Fixed version. It will rename all the items from "Dwemer" to "Cyrodiilic Dwarven". It's fine to update mid-game.
  
* **High Level Player version.** Standalone. Based on the Heavy and Light Armor version. Dragonplate and Dragonscale stats for the armors. You will need Dragon Bones and Scales to temper it too.
**The Forgotten City - Immaculate Dwarven Armor replacer**. New ESP (flagged as ESL) file to allow female helmets, female armor weight slider, and several fixes. Legacy of The Dragonborn Immaculate Helmet replaced. It's safe to install/uninstall it at any time.

* **Fabric Color patches** (Miscellaneous files). Amethyst and Obsidian colors added. 2K and 4K, Default and Ancient Dwemer Metal versions included. Only textures. It's safe to install/uninstall it at any time.
**Improved Closedfaced Helmets patch**(Miscellaneous files). It's a bug fixing patch, not a visual one. It restores the Dwemer Helmet values to vanilla, to fix the invisible helmet problem. Just load this patch last of all. ESL.
