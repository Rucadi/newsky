**V1.2.1 has been released!**

  

I recommend making a clean save if you are updating halfway through the quest.

  

[XB-1 version here!](https://bethesda.net/en/mods/skyrim/mod-detail/4157303)

  
After a rather long hiatus, I hereby present my third fully fledged set of weapons and female-only light armour. The items can be acquired upon the completion of a short but hopefully unique and enjoyable quest, with a small amount of voice acting to boot. In addition, all items can be crafted at a forge once said quest has been completed. The quest will start game-enabled and should initially lead you to Riverwood, although I do recommend being at least level 20 before giving the last part of the quest a go.
  
  
Each item comes with a subtle effect, but all can be enchanted by yourself as well:
  
  
**Echtra (greatsword):**
  
﻿Sprinting power attacks have a chance (depending on your skill with two-handed weapons) to become sweeping (area-of-effect) attacks and to briefly slow the passage of time itself.
  
  
**Immram (bow):**
  
﻿Shots fired when an opponent is about to hit you with a melee or ranged weapon have a chance (depending on your archery skill) to disarm it.
  
**Armour (cuirass):**  
  
After being struck in combat, there is a chance (depending on your skill with light armour) to briefly increase your movement speed as well as greatly increasing your resistance to any further damage.
  
  
**[b]Torc (amulet):**[/b]
  
Depending on the day of the week, the torc will bestow a random effect on you:
  
  

  
* Sundas - you have a 100% chance to recover arrows.
Mondas - your chance to get a critical strike with weapons is increased by 33%.
  
* Tirdas - the damage done by your weapon is increased by 25%.
Middas - spells cost 50% less to cast.
  
* Turdas - items sold by vendors are 25% cheaper.
Fredas - fall damage is reduced by 80%.
  
* Loredas - you may now harvest three ingredients from plants, mushrooms and other sources.

  
The armour itself is set to use the basic UNP body, which should be compatible with most body retexture mods. This doesn't mean it's incompatible with CBBE: the gear will look great regardless of which body type you are using! Please notify me should any serious discrepancies (other than cup size) arise through the usage of different body mods. I would, however, welcome any community efforts to include BodySlide support. Finally, users of RaceMenu might find the same bodypaint used in my screenshots in their body overlays, although it is by no means a hard dependency.
  
  
**INSTALLATION**
  
  
Since v1.1.0, the mod now comes as a FOMOD-package and should be installed using your favourite mod manager.
  
  
**INCOMPATIBILITIES:**
  
  
One of the few key areas modified by this mod seems to also be in use by [Citizens of Tamriel II](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/99406). It's not a compatibility issue per se, although it might set you off on the wrong foot. I recently changed the cutscene that plays there to make it clearer as to what direction you are supposed to follow, but I'll add this small spoiler to avoid further confusion for users of Citizens of Tamriel II:
  
SpoilerThere are no dragons involved anywhere in the quest added by this mod.**PERMISSION**
