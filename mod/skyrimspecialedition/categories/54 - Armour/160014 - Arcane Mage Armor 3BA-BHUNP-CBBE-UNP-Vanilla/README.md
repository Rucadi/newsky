[font=Verdana]The mod features new lore-friendly clothing armor for female characters, which is compatible with all popular and basic body types: 3BA, CBBE, BHUNP, UNP, Vanilla, and UBE (link will be added soon). Since the armor has an obvious mage vibe, I made an optional replacer for all mage types of robes, which will also affect the appearance of characters from the **College of Winterhold**. This replacer will **NOT** affect robes intended for necromancers, warlocks, and other magical character types.
  
  
[/font][font=Verdana]The armor itself is not particularly modular, but it still comes with accessories that will delight you, and the color schemes match the colors of the Skyrim schools of magic. The basic version of the outfit, not tied to any school of magic, is presented in blue.[/font]

[font=Verdana]Armor can be crafted at **Skyforge**. There is no secret meaning to this, I just like having all my mods in one place.  Also, to say it again, you can always install the optional version with the mage robes replacer and get it the classic way (by joining the College of Winterhold or just playing a game).[/font]
  
  

[font=Verdana]**Armor parts:**
  
  
Armor
  
Gloves
  
Boots
  
Hood
  
Hood for use with hair (57 slot)
  
Belt (56 slot)
  
Amulet (35 slot)
  
Earrings (42 slot)[/font]

[font=Verdana]The set also includes a new hairstyle, which can be found in **RaceMenu**. It is called **[FB] Arcane Mage Hair**. There is also a version called **[FB] Arcane Mage Hair (Hood)**, which is adapted for use with the corresponding Arcane Mage Hood. You can try combining this hood with any other hairstyle and find other combinations as well.
  
  
If you install the version with the replacer, the appearance of the magic robes will change depending on your level of mastery of a particular school of magic. Thus, after leveling up from novice to master, your character will wear a full set of attire consisting of the robe itself, boots, gloves, a belt, an amulet, and an earring.[/font]

[font=Verdana]**Installation**
  
  
I think that a little explanation will be necessary here. The mod has three main versions: 3BA-CBBE, BHUNP-UNP and Vanilla. All main versions come in 4k. The UBE version is not included in the mod, but is available [as a patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/160437)﻿ created by talented [Toto](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Riholu)﻿.
  
  
In the same section you can find the replacer version and textures with 2k resolution. Yup, you can use both the main mod and the replacer at the same time.[/font]
