* Chevalier's Half-Plate
Chevalier's Plate
  
* Chevalier's Plate and Surcoat

  
* Chevalier's Gauntlets
Chevalier's Gloves

Chevalier's Boots
  
* Chevalier's Leather Boots

To make the armor even more personalized, I've added ~~47~~ 59 distinct crests. These crests serve as a kind of coat of arms that can be displayed on your chest. They represent various elements such as Skyrim holds, political affiliations, gods, daedric princes, magic schools and more. Here's a complete list:

They are separate items that can be equipped in the same way as any other armor piece.
  
  
The fabric comes in blue by default, but I've also added five other color variations: black, green, purple, red, and yellow.

**Crafting and distribution:**
  
  
The stats are similar to those of Steel Plate, and you can craft it with the Advanced Armor Crafting perk.
  
  
Items can be found in chests, purchased from blacksmiths and received as a quest reward starting from level 18.
  
Worn by several housecarls of the Empire-aligned holds (Lydia of Whiterun, Rayya of Falkreath, Jordis the Sword-Maiden of Solitude, Argis the Bulwark of Markarth)
  
  
Several items, such as the mail coif, hood, leather boots, and leather gloves, are considered light armor. However, they still count as a set for the Matching Set perk.
  
Ver. 1.1 - The FOMOD has been updated to allow players to choose whether they want all pieces of armor to be heavy or for the Half-Plate to be considered light armor!
  
  
You can create different color variants from the base (blue) variant. You can also buy them or find them in the world.Crests cannot be bought or found in the world. They become available for crafting at the forge when you have Half-Plate or Surcoat and Plate in your inventory. No crafting perks are required.

[Skypatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106659) - distributes the new items to leveled lists and NPCs. You don't have to install it, but then the only way to obtain the items would be through crafting.
  
[Faster HDT-SMP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57339) - for cloth physics. You can choose the no-physics option in the FOMOD of course, however, I must warn you that I have not spent much time testing and fine-tuning this option (especially for Half-Plate, which looks especially crappy). I promise that your potato PC won't explode from using just one armor mod with cloth physics.
  
If you're using OBody, I suggest you disable ORefit, as it will break crests.
