﻿This mod modifies all of the Creation Club helmets to have open eyes and faces where there were dark voids before, much in the spirit of [Improved Closeface Helmets](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/824).

Included in the installer are optional Bodyslide files to tweak eye positions and make some helmets *even more* open!
