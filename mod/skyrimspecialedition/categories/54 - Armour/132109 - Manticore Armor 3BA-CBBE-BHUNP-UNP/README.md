Manticore is a simple leather armor that is stuck between being lore and not lore-friendly. [/font][font=Verdana]I have no other words to describe what it looks like. Inside you will find the armor itself, boots, armlets and... horns. They are helmet marked, so when wearing the full set, your light armor perks should work to the fullest. Several color options. Suitable for 3BA, BHUNP, CBBE and UNP bodies. In the Main Files section you will find the mod itself with a basic pre-built version of the armor. BodySlides for each body type are available in the Miscellaneous section.
  
  
[/font][font=Verdana]Armor Class - Light (Leather). Craft it in the **Skyforge** or just pull all the stuff out via any ESP explorer, your choice. Tempering is also available.[/font]

[font=Verdana]**Q**: **Can I use this mod with Vanilla body?**
  
**A**: Not recommended. There is no perfect adaptation for it. Given that there are exposed skin areas, there will be conflicts with skin textures.
  
  
**Q**: **Can I make a conversion for [BodySlide-name] or [Body-name]?**
  
**A**: Yup, you can make whatever patches you want. But publishing such conversions/patches should definitely require the original mod to be installed and only include the meshes conversion.
  
  
**Q**: **What is the name of the preset/hair in the screenshot?**
  
**A**: Which one? The author is indicated under each screenshot. Please specify the screenshot number and the author's name at once in questions like this. If the author reads comments and considers it necessary, they will answer your question about the preset or other modifications used. I can't help you here.[/font][font=Verdana]
  
  
**Q**: **More colors?**
  
**A**: Make 'em yourself  ![](https://i.imgur.com/i7aMYYU.png)
  
  
**Q**: **I don't like this, can you redo that?**
