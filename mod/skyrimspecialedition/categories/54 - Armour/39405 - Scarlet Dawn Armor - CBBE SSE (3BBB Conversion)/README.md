# Scarlet Dawn Armor - CBBE SSE (3BBB Conversion)

This mod updates the Armor (Physics) mesh to 3BBB compatibility .  Requires the [Original mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13058?tab=description)  to work.  Install like any other mod (just make sure to install this after the orignal mod) and either Merge or overwrite original mod when asked to.
  
The only thing I did was open the outfit in [Outfit studio](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/201)  and follow the guide at the bottom of the page in [CBBE 3BBBs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30174)  description to convert it from regular CBBE physics to 3BBB.
  
  
I liked the outfit but couldn't stand to watch the old physics with it so I decided to update it.  Now the Physics (jiggles) are much better.
  
Boobs Belly Butt and Thighs Jiggle now.
  
This is my first upload so I hope it goes well.
  
  
WARNING - For people using presets that are Super Top or Bottom Heavy you made need to tweak it in outfit studio.  Here is a guide someone shared to fix that problem - https://www.patreon.com/posts/guide-fix-broken-22503272.  I hope it helps.
  
  
Please Endorse if you like it so I know it works.
