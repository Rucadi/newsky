This mod adds a standalone heavy armor set and greatsword inspired by Fantasy.
  
  
The armor all share almost the exact same stats and recipes as vanilla Ebony armor, which means you craft them at a forge under the Ebony section! (Or use console commands/[AddItemMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17563))
  
  
Armor in game is named ''Steel Vanguard [Armor Piece]''. Weapon is ''Steel Vanguard Greatsword''.
