**About**
  
  
I got bored looking at the same low quality circlets that exist in Skyrim, so I decided to create a brand new set, one that lets me keep my armor perks, whilst still being able to see my characters face.
  
  
Both model and textures were created by me using 3ds Max 2011/2014 and Photoshop CS6.
  
  
**What this mod includes:** Armored & Mage Circlets for the Vanilla Armor Types. An NPC vendor is also available in Whiterun's Warmaidens.

**Obtaining:**
  
  
They are smithed, each under their respective materials. For example, a Daedric Circlet will be classed as Heavy Armor and have exactly the same stats as a Daedric Helmet. Also can be purchased from "Erdna Nidnarb" in Whiteruns Warmaiden's store.
