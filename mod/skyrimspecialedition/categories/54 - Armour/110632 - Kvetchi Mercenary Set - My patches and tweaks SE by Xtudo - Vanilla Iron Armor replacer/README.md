**KVETCHI MERCENARY SET**

**My patches by Xtudo**

**Description**
  
**My patches and tweaks for this amazing mod.**
  

  
* Added missing races to the Helmet and Gauntlets.
Removed ITM records.
  
* Carried on Unofficial Patch fixes.
Changed to "Initially Disabled" a previously deleted NPC reference, to avoid possible CTDs.
  
* Recipe requirements changed to Steel Smithing Perk, from Advanced Light Armors Perk, as it is a Heavy Steel Plate Armor.
Some minor fixes to the armor chest textures.
  
* Fixed "hole" in the Sword model. Added missing blood effects to it.
Fixed neck clipping trough the armor while not using the helmet.
  
* Edited helmet clothing to avoid clipping with the back of the armor.
Improved collision of ground items.
  
* Added missing legs to the armors.
Added "Warm" keyword for the Survival mode.
  
* ESL file that works with any Skyrim version. It will replace the original KvetchiMercenary.esl file.
The default Main Fixes file is fully compatible with 3BA, SAM or similar patches.
  
* **Optional Non-HDT** patch. All fixes already included. Non compatible with 3BA or similar patches.
**Optional Light Armor version.** It adds an extra light armored version, while keeping the original heavy as well. So, you will have the two versions available in-game. Advanced Armors Smithing Crafting Perk required. Requires one of the Main files installed first. It's safe to install mid-game, you won't loose any already crafted item.
  
* **Optional Vanilla Iron Armor replacer.** Requires one of the Main files installed first.

  
**I made it for my game and now I'm sharing it, I hope you like it.**- [LE version here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/117519).
