**Crafting Manual**
  
- Unlocks the ability to craft the armor. Information on how to get it in game, look under 'locations' here in the description or watch the video.
  
  
**Combined Armor**
  
- The armor set consists 18 separate pieces. You can combine 15 of the minor pieces to one cuirass in game.
  
   You will end up with 4 pieces like in vanilla (Helmet, Cuirass, Gloves, Boots).
  
   The combined cuirass is called 'Asura's Guard'. 
  
   
  
**Morph Helmet and Heels**- You can morph heels and helmet in game.
  
  Make heels to sabatons or the opposite.
  
  Make the helmet to an unmasked helmet or the opposite.
  
  
**Scrap Combined Armor**- When you have combined your armor pieces to 'Asura's Guard', you can scrap it and make separate pieces again.
  
  
**How does it work?**- Once you have read the crafting manual, you can make 3 different drinks at the forge. At the forge you can always circle through them.
  
  1: Asura's Craft: You can craft the armor with the required materials.
  
  2: Asura's Morph: You can combine the armor and switch between heels/sabatons and helmet/unmasked helmet.
  
  3: Asura's Scrap: You can make the combined armor and make separate pieces again.
  
- When you are done smithing, just drink the potion or throw it away.
  
  
**The Idea**
  
- This system allows you to modify the armor in a non destructive way. You can always revert your changes.
  
  You will lose upgrades and enchantments when you morph it but you won't lose the piece.
  
  
  
  
**Zap Sliders**
  
**Everything here is also covered in the tutorial video.
  
Link with timestamp: >[Zap Sliders](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QciP8OivPQU&t=28s)<**
  
- Many of the Armor pieces have Zap Sliders for more customization options.
  
- The combined piece (Asura's Guard) can be customized to the same extend as the individual pieces.
  
- What are Zap Sliders and how do I use them?:
  
  
Spoiler
  
Zap Sliders can be used in BodySlide to hide specific parts of an outfit. For example you don't want a vambrace on the left arm, just click on the slider box and it won't show in game.
