"When my time has come I vow and swear
  
I will go to Valhalla in combat gear"*

[font=Verdana]Einherjar [Einherjr] in Scandinavian mythology, the best of the warriors who have fallen in battle and who live in Valhalla. A new set of immersive armor for female characters in Skyrim bears that name. Why only female characters? Because I felt like it. And because I have a different name for the male outfit with a similar theme. The set also includes a new weapon pack consisting of a small axe, a big two-handed axe and a shield (with 16 different ornaments). For those who are interested only in weapons, in the "miscellaneous" section is available for download weapons-only version of the mod.
  
  
I tried to fit this mod into the authentic atmosphere of the game as much as possible, so all the color schemes available for the outfit are a copy of the colors of 9 house holds of Skyrim.[/font]

[font=Verdana]All can be crafted at **Skyforge** (except for three unique shields). Why? Dunno, I like it that way. But in the same way nobody forbids you to get it through Additem Menu. You are big, grown ups and you know how to do everything without my tips.

New Weapons[/font]

[font=Verdana]Everything about the new weapons is also very simple. A small one-handed axe, a large two-handed axe and 13 different shields can be crafted at Skyforge. 
  
  
Three unique shields are lost somewhere in the vastness of the world, and you can find them by exploring the terrain of Skyrim. Or by using ESP explorer. These shields have unique enchantments.
  
  
**Yggdrasil Shield**
  
Yggdrasil is the tree of life. Magical in its own way. You can find a shield with its image and strengthen your life force near the other Wonder Tree.[/font]
  
SpoilerEldergleam Sanctuary, near the Tree.
  
  
[font=Verdana]**Fenrir Shield**
  
To feel the fury of the wolf who wants to devour the sun and bring about Ragnarök, all you have to do is follow the wolf's path. You will find the shield in a coven that worships Hirsin and animal nature.[/font]
  
SpoilerGlenmoril Coven, on the tree. You will get to this place through the quest chain of the Companions.
  
  
[font=Verdana]**Sleipnir Shield**
  
The legendary eight-legged steed is your best friend if you want to increase your carrying weight. However, this shield was left somewhere in the wreckage of a ship that went down between the northern cliffs.[/font]
  
SpoilerWreck of The Winter War.

[font=Verdana]Q: No HDT for dress and cloak?????
  
A: No HDT. Don't mind if anyone makes a patch for my mod.
  
  
Q: I don't have the mod displayed even through ESP explorer.
  
A: Most likely you have installed the mod incorrectly or are using an outdated version of the game. If you have the second case, check if you have installed mods from the "required" category.
  
  
Q: More colors? More modularity?
  
A: Nope.
  
  
Q: Any chance for a male version?
  
A: Nope. This armor will remain female only. I will NOT give any permission for a male patch. I have other Viking armor projects planned for male characters.
  
  
Q: Can you make a patch for [body-name] or specific preset?
  
A: Nope, but I don't mind if anyone else makes that patch.
  
  
[/font][font=Verdana]Q: I installed the main mod and then the weapons pack, and I have no armor in the game
  
A: Weapons are already included in the main mod. A separate weapons file is needed for those players who want new weapons, but not armor. The files overwrite each other, so choose only one version of the mod.[/font]
