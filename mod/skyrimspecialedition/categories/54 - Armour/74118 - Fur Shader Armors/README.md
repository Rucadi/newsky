This effect works by putting several meshes on top of the fur areas with a variety of size and transparency to create the illusion of fur.
  
So naturally these armors have a higher triangle count over the vanilla ones but nothing too crazy. The non fur areas of the armors are unchanged so texture replacers will still apply
  
  
The body shapes included are vanilla male and cbbe female body (bodyslide files included)
