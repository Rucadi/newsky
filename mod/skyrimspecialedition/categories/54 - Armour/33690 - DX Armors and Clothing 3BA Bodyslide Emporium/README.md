How to use:
  
  
Please make sure to download the original mods from DeserterX for textures.
  
Choose from an All in One, Modular, or individual FOMOD installer.
  
Launch Bodyslide and go to "Group Filter" (center column).
  
Choose the group you wish to build and click batch build.
  
  
There are 2 types of light flagged files to choose from ESL and ESPFE
  
  
ESL: These were made through Creation Kit and are treated like masters in your load order. However,
  
these files have compressed form IDS, meaning you cannot use these in existing saved games. Form Ids are what the game 
  
uses to register items in-game. If the form IDs get changed the save that relied on the original form IDs will disappear. 
  
A NEW GAME IS REQUIRED TO USE ESL!
  
  
ESPFE: These were made in XEdit and do not have compressed form Id's. You can use these with existing games
  
without issue. 
  
  
When in doubt about which to use, please use ESPFE.
  
  
﻿﻿[color=#b4a7d6]Includes a bunch of options for physics:
  
  
Immersive Breast Physics: New and sort of experimental. This greatly subdues the breast
  
physics but still allows some jiggle for Crimson Blood and Daedric Reaper. This is an attempt to make a happy medium between the Immersive and Physics versions. If you do not care about this please build
  
Immersive or Physics version.
  
  
Immersive Physics: This removes the breast and belly physics from the heavy armor or metal armor. Wearing these armors you'll have butt and leg physics but no breast or belly. If you are not a fan of this please use the Immersive Breast Physics or Physics version.
  
  
Physics: These have full physics on all armor regardless of heavy or metal armor. This is used as a fail-safe to check physics is working and also as an option for in-game. Use this if you do not like the physics for the Immersive Breast or Immervis physics version.

Known Incompatibilities:
  
  
These bodyslide files are incompatible with Docteure and Jeir's DeserterX
  
CBBE bodyslide conversions. Their mods not only included changes that I have provided,
  
but many of them changes the body partitions of many armor pieces. Meaning the armors
  
are not modular.﻿
  
  
[/color]Another thing to note: Docteure and Jeir have a clear statement that they do not want their work to be 
  
used with other body mods.
  
  
Please do not ask me to make a compatibility patch for Docteure and Jeir's versions. I have no interest
  
or desire to copy another modder's work. The only thing I ask is to give my version a try.
  
  
  
  
  
  
This is the complete set of all DeserterX's Armors and Clothes
  
  
What's included?
  
All files and optional files have been converted to ESL and ESPFE.
  
  
Zap sliders have been attached for the following:
  
Dark Knight
  
Daughter of the Sea
  
Necromancer Robes
  
Succubus (Mazken) Armor
  
Witcher Armor
  
  
As well as additional content (I'm not telling :P )
  
Thank you for downloading!
