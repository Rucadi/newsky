**Heavy Armor.** *The Wild Hunt armors can only be acquired by defeating the Champion of the Hunt. The Champion of the Hunt can be found at Shadowgreen Cavern just north of the Thalmor Embesy (Top left of skyrim). It is highly recommended to be a high level character as you will be facing off against a level 80 character and other strong enemies. The armors have the same armor stats as Dragon bone and Dragon Scale armors*

**Update 1.3 installation:** Just make sure the .esp and the .bsa are directly in the data folder.
  

Installation is very simple. Just make sure that the .esp file in inside the Data folder. This Meshes folder should be merged with the Data meshes folder and this texture folder should be merged with the Data texture folder. Path for Meshes: Skyrim/Data/Meshes/Armor/BosmerArmorMATY743/(All mesh files and some folders). Path for Textures: Skyrim/Data/Textures/Armor/BosmerArmor/(All texture files).
  
Note. Some people are having the bug where the folders a extracted twice inside each other. So instead of Skyrim/Data/Meshes/Bosmer/[files here] the folders are being extracted as Skyrim/Data/Meshes/Bosmer/Data/Meshes/Bosmer/[files here]. This will cause the items to be invisible in game. The fix is just drag or cut the last deepest meshes folder and past it inside the data folder. Agree to merge and it should work. This task needs to be preformed on both the texure and mesh folders. I might change the file format for next update so that it use .bsa files. Hopefully that will solve the issue

Please go give these contributors some Kudos and check out and endorse their amazing mods as without their help this mod might not have come to completion.
  
- Firstly a huge thank you to **Arynn** for allowing me to use his amazing chest/vest mesh as a base starting point for my armor. Without this asset it would have taken me a great amount of time to get the look I wanted and I may have even ditched the project all together. Check out his superb oblivion mods, especially the lotr ones. I just wish I had known about these when I was playing oblivion last.

 - Secondly a big thank you to **Isilmeriel** for letting me use her Dagger meshes and some base textures. I absolutely love these Daggers and also the rest of her superb lotr weapon pack. I highly recommend getting this pack if you do not have it already as it blends perfectly into skyrim.

I now have a facebook page! So now you can easily get mod updates, chat to me, give me ideas, sketches, organize mod projects or anything really. You may even on occasion get access to betas so I can get feedback before releasing final mods. This is the best place to message me as Nexus and steam workshop have limited messaging capability so on here I will always have a record of conversations:)

You can not be using a service like patreon where you would be getting profit from releasing the mod. Normal donations are fine. As usual credit and link should be given.
  
   
**Change log**   
**June 18 V1.2**   
- A small update to add armors to leveled loot lists
  
**June 23 V1.3**   
- Light Hunter armor is now lose in the little island. Mannequin has been removed due to some people having bugs with it.
  
- File format has changed. Now I have saved as .bsa. This should solve the weird issue were files were unpacked twice inside each other.
  
- All Bosmer Hunter npc's will now wear Bosmer plain armor.
  
- Added armor to some Bosmer characters. Depending on the character and the back story they might be wearing the armor or it may be in their home. Only Bomser I felt suited the armor have been added.
  
- Changed Angi from a nord to a bosmer and given bosmer armor. The back story doesn't say anything about her having to be a nord. Since she is an archer trainer I felt she was better suited to be a bosmer. Sorry if this annoys some people.
  
- Added a Hireling follower "Larethia" to Dead Man's Drink in Falkreath. She is equipped with bosmer armor and weapons and will use dual daggers as well as bow. Her voice is the same as Jenassa Hireling.
  
   
Please note there is a bug with hireing Jenassa when using this mod. I have tried to fix it but have had no luck and the only way I can think of fixing it would involve completly remaking the eps file which I don't have time to do. This patch here should still work with Special edition http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58688/? If anyone can explain what I need to change to fix this my self please let me know! Cheers
