This is my remodeled version of the Dwarven armor, intended to reduce bulkiness considerably and to add an SMP physics-enabled skirt. This mod includes body armor and also new boots with a particularly tall platform.
  
  
Please note, this mod requires HDT-SMP, preferably Faster HDT-SMP for performance improvements:

There is also a standalone version if you only want it on your character - you can get the armor by using additemmenu or by typing this into the console:
  

```
help "C Dwarven"
```

  
This armor is not meant to be practical or lore-friendly, as realistically the skirt and shorts offer zero protection from any damage. However, I hope that you feel like it looks cute regardless.
  
  
There is a slight amount of sex appeal, but I wanted the armor to look 'cute' and also sleek and cool. It reminds me a bit of the Radahn armor from elden ring personally, now that I am looking at it again. I hope you enjoy this mod, at least half as much as I enjoyed making it for you. 
  
  
If you are using the replacer version, then no esp is required for this mod to work. Just install it into your data folder. Pre-generated meshes are included, using a custom version of CBBE Oppai but with smaller breasts to make the armor fit better.
  
  
Due to the nature of SMP physics, some clipping is bound to occur. However, if anything other than the skirt is clipping really badly, please let me know and I will try to fix it.
  
  
I have also made a dawnguard armor remodel, check it out here: 
  
<https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98414>For reading this far, here are images of my concept art for this armor set. The original design had a wraparound skirt, but I could not figure out the physics on it so I decided on the front/back split robe style instead.
