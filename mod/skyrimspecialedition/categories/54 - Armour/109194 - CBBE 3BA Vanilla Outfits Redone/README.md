**[size=4]THE POSTS ARE CURRENTLY BUGGED, AWAITING A FIX.[/size]**
  
*For now you can discuss the update and ask questions in the FORUM section.*

  
  
***Why This Conversion?***
  

  
* More than a simple conversion, this is a complete improvement project for all vanilla and Creation Club outfits, built upon the excellent foundation of the CBBE 2.0 conversions.
Some outfits were meticulously conformed using a combination of multiple conversion references to achieve the best possible fit.
  
* Includes hand-tuned mesh weighting and BodySlide sliders to ensure a perfect fit for your custom body preset and smooth movement in-game.
Corrected partitions to eliminate the issue of see-through gaps on limbs.\*
  
* Rim lighting has been disabled on all meshes to prevent the "plastic" glow effect.
Includes carefully drawn "Zap" sliders to eliminate visible skin gaps and provide more customization options.
  
* You can choose between physics and non-physics versions through their respective groups.
    
  *\*some combinations will show gaps and clipping regardless, due to a limitation within the game's logic, and cannot be properly fixed.*

  
**About BodySlide Groups**
  
  
**- Physics** - Applies jiggle physics to all outfits that have the option, regardless of material type, excluding those made of fully rigid materials (like plate armor). 'Immersive Physics' projects are only selected if there are no 'Physics' counterparts. 
  
**- No Physics** - Disables all jiggle physics.
  
**- Immersive Physics (Im Physics)** - **(Recommended)** The author's choice. This is a curated mix of the 'Physics' and 'No Physics' groups. 'Immersive Physics' projects are selected instead of their 'Physics' counterparts where applicable.
  
**- HDT-SMP Add-on (SMP)** - Provides HDT-SMP cloth physics for compatible outfits, building upon the 3BBB physics from the 'Immersive Physics' group.
  
  
  
**Compatibility**
  

  
* Compatible with simple retexture mods like [Rustic Clothing](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4703)﻿ without a patch.
Compatible with texture variation mods like [Styles of Skyrim - Merchant Clothes Variations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/143310) without a patch.
  
* This mod incorporates edits similar to [WACCF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18994)﻿ and is compatible with [ACE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19002)﻿ by default. For meshes added by those mods, please use my [companion conversion mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/110680)﻿.
Retextures that include their own mesh files to change shader properties may not be fully compatible and could require a patch.
  
* Directly conflicts with other vanilla mesh replacers. To resolve this in BodySlide, either build the other mod's outfits after building mine, or select their version from the conflict resolution pop-up during a batch build. This will ensure their meshes override mine.

**FAQ**
  
***1. Why "Redone"?***
  
- The name "Redone" signifies that this is a complete mesh improvement project built on a modern CBBE foundation, setting it apart from a simpler 3BA vanilla conversion that existed when this was released.
  
  
***2. The outfits in the screenshots look skimpy.***
  
- These are the regular vanilla outfits. A few of them can be customized with optional Zap sliders in BodySlide to be more revealing, but the default appearance is not skimpy.
  
  
***3. Can I use this with the standard CBBE body instead of 3BA?***
  
- Yes, you can. However, you will not see the 3BBB physics (bounce and jiggle).
  
  
***4. Do I need to start a new game?***
  
- No. This mod is safe to install or uninstall mid-playthrough\*. Important: If you uninstall, remember to delete the generated meshes from your BodySlide output folder to revert to your previous setup. \*When uninstalling the DAV Add-on during a playthrough, delete everything except the related .esp files; That will effectively disable the add-on without compromising your save data.
  
  
***5. I'm lost with all the files and options.***
  
- The optional files are independent of the main file; just load them after it. All conflict resolution is handled in BodySlide. When you "Build" a mesh, that version overwrites any others, effectively winning any conflict.
  
  
***6. I'm on a Skyrim build from 1984 and can't use BEES because people say it's buggy.***
  
- You can convert the main plugin by opening it in SSEEdit (xEdit) and changing the file header version from 1.71 to 1.70. However that may not work with other plugins if they use the extended forms.
  
  
***7. What are zap sliders?***
  
- Zap sliders are the checkboxes found at the top of the slider list in BodySlide, used to hide or swap parts of an outfit. Ensuring the outfit looks correct after a zap is used can sometimes be a complex task requiring a lot of extra work. For this reason, my priority for this mod is mesh quality and fixes, rather than adding a large number of customization zaps.
  
  
***8. I'm completely new to BodySlide. What should I do?***
  
- The best place to start is by watching a tutorial. [This video guide is highly recommended](https://youtu.be/zil1RwoW3OE). I'd also recommend to watch [the whole series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQJEPLnA9D8&list=PLrGqMZcWJgEklIespJy8XhwFIXKsxv7VJ&index=1) for a complete understanding.
