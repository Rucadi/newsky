**WOLFCRY ARMOR****by Xtudo**

**Description**
  
**This mod arose from the idea of making a "My version" of the Wolfcry Armor that the adorable Vilja makes for you. And, as someone suggested, I also created a standalone version.**
  

  
* 2 Heavy Armor sets and 2 Light Armor sets. 2 Swords and 2 Greatswords. 2 Shields. 2 equipable Shields on back. 18 new items.
Male and female versions, with full beast races support.
  
* Vilja Armor Replacer and Standalone Version. You can install both without any problem.
The Standalone version can be crafted at any forge, and you can enchant and temper all items up to Legendary. The stats are a bit superior than the Nordic Carved Armor.
  
* The Main files are 4K-2K. Optional 2K-1K patch available.
"Warm" keyword included, for the Survival mode.
  
* All ESP files are flagged as ESL.

**Wolf Armor replacer**. Replaces the vanilla Companion's armor. Standalone, textures included. aMidianBorn Wolf Shield replaced too.
  
* **Equipped Swords and Shield on Back patch**. Adds two great swords to the Equippable Heavy Shield. It's only aesthetic, I made it for my game, and now I'm sharing it, maybe you like it too. Only meshes and textures. Requires the Main Standalone Version installed first.
**Reduced Equipped Heavy Shield on Back patch**. Default and Equipped Sword versions available. Only meshes and textures. Requires the Main Standalone Version installed first.
  
* **Improved Camera SE patch**. Fixes the armor's first person view. Install it last of all.
**Only Shields version**. It only has the 4 shields. Standalone. It only has the 4 shields. Fully compatible with Reduced Equipped Heavy Shield on Back and Swords on Shield (this one requires the Main file textures) patches, install them last.
