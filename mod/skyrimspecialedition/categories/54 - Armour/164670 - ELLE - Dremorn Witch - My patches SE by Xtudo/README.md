DREMORN WITCH
  
My patches by Xtudo****Description**
  
**My patches and tweaks for the beautiful armor mod made by Ellxe.**
  
  
**Tweaks and edits**
  
It will replace **[ELLE] Dremorn Witch.esp** and **[ELLE] Dremorn Witch Staff.esp**. It's fine to update mid-game, you won't lose any already crafted item.

  
* **Added clothing (Unarmored) version**, ideal for pure mage characters, for example.
**Added no high heels boots**.
  
* **Beast races support**, for the Hat and Blindfold.
**Removed the Crafting Books from the world**, to avoid vanilla records edits, and possible conflicts with many other mods. **Now you can craft the books at any Tanning Rack.**
  
* Added missing footstep sounds to the boots.
Added armor keywords to the armored items.
  
* Added Warm keyword to armored items, for the Survival Mode.
Changed extra items to clothing, to avoid problems/bugs with the Matching Set and Custom Fit perks.
  
* Edited crafting recipes.
Adjusted prices.
  
* STAVES: Removed staves tempering recipes.
STAVES: Added proper Skill Data to the staves.
  

  
**Optional files**
  

  
* **4K** (original size), **2K** and **1K**optimized textures.
**Heels Sounds patch**.
  
* **Edited Hat Position patch**.
**Illia SPID patch**. No high heels boots by default. If you want heels, replace**XtudoIlliaOutfitBoots** by **XtudoIlliaOutfitHeels** in the ini file.
