This mod adds a standalone heavy armor set inspired by Dark Fantasy.
  
  
The armor all share almost the exact same stats and recipes as vanilla Ebony armor, which means you craft them at a forge under the Ebony section! (Or use console commands/[AddItemMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17563))
