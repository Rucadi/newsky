• The armor is a bit stronger and a bit lighter compared to a vanilla ebony armor.
  
  
• The Helmet, Earrings, Cuirass, Gauntlets and Boots can be enchanted normally.
  
  
• The earrings have the same stats as the helmet and are an option for those who don't much like wearing helmets.

You can use assets of this armor inside Skyrim SE Nexus as long as you credit our work in the comments and you
  
don't make an almost duplicate of this mod. Meaning, this armor can be used to dress followers or be part of
  
a bigger project and assets like parts of this armor can be used to supplement your own armor creations.
  
  
Please don't copy the textures if you are making a conversion.
