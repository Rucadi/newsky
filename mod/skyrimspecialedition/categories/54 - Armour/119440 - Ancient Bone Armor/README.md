This plugin has been created with the most recent version of the creation kit, if you are on a game version earlier than 1.6.1130 I recommend you use [BEES](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441) otherwise your game will crash or wont start. If you dont wanna use that mod you have to set the version of the .esp in SSEdit from 1.71 to 1.70.
  
  
Install using your favourite mod manager.
  
  
You have to build the outfit in Body Slide.
  
  
Safe to install mid-save.
  
  
Default texture resolution is 2k, higher resolutions are found under optional files. I personally recommend 4k.
