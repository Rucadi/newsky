This mod was born from a conversation I had with **Coldsun**, who helped bring my idea to the incredibly talented **RussianBear**. I originally envisioned something inspired by *Game of Thrones*, but set apart from central characters like Daenerys. RussianBear deserves **all** the credit, not only for masterfully crafting this beautiful, detailed set, but also for embracing the concept and generously making it a public mod. Thanks to his permission, I’m able to share it here on Nexus so more people can enjoy his outstanding work!
  
For those who love *Dorne* and *House Martell*, I believe this set fits nicely into *The Elder Scrolls* lore as a stylish and immersive leather armor option. It draws strong inspiration from [Obara Sand’s armor](https://i.imgur.com/Bs9cpkG.png) ﻿and weaponry, and the spear comes in three versions: spear, halberd, and quarterstaff. The armor is also modular, so you can make a variety of looks with it.
