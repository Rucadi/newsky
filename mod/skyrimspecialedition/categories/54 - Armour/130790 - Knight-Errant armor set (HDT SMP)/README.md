This outfit doesn't have bodyslide files. There is no need to run bodyslide or anything.
  
  
Ingame it can be crafted at the forge (ebony tier).
  
Or use [Additem menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17563)﻿.
  
  
**REQUIREMENTS:**
  
[Faster HDT SMP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57339).
  
[Backported Extended ESL Support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441?tab=files) (For older version of Skyrim).
  
  
**NOTES:**
  
  
- The helmet only block the hair and ears. Character head is still visible. That mean if the character head has, like, a gigantic chin, or other extreme roleplaying-deformities, it gonna clip throught the helmet.
  
- I consider this outfit non revealing so I didn't make bodyslide for body mods. Users of 3BA, UNP, BHUNP, HIMBO, etc... can use it just fine but the armor won't conform to the character's body proportions. It conform to your character's weight.
  
  
**PERMISSIONS:**
  
  
- Body conversion, translation, stats tweak, ... Anything but upload the mod on any other site.
  
  
**KNOWN ISSUES:**
  
  
- I'm not well verse in Skyrim armor modding. The physics may not look perfect. If you know of any way to improve, or to fix bug, consider teaching me by dm my discord Mykolaev, if you have time. Thank you.
