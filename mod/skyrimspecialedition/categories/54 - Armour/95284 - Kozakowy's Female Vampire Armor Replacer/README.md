The package consists of:
  
  
- the armor replacer esp models and textures
  
  
**2. Known issues (PLEASE READ BEFORE USING!!! ):**
  
- there's **no weightslider** compatibility
  
- some **minor clipping** may occur but this rig is the best I can ;)
  
- **female only**
  
- **no gloves**
  
- **vampire boots** are replaced with higher ones, so other vampire armors can look a bit strange
  
  
**3. How to get it in game:**
  
  
- just install the mod and the armor should be replaced right after that
  
  
**4. Installation:**
  
  
- I suggest using MO or NMM, you can also extract the package manually, but that is not advised.
  
  
**5. Uninstallation:**
