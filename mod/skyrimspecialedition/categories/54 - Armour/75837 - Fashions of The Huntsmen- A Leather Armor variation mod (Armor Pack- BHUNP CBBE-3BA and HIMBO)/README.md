# Fashions of The Huntsmen- A Leather Armor variation mod (Armor Pack- BHUNP CBBE-3BA and HIMBO)
- Author: GolinskiPRH

Have you noticed that every single leather armor in skyrim looks the same? Of course you did, and this mod ains to change that, by adding 9 (15 if you count all variations) new lore-friendly leather armor sets to the game, suiting other regions and races`s smithing styles. Every time you encounter someone using leather, it will be one of 15 variations. This is done by changing the Outfit records of the leather sets in the game, by adding the armors into sublists and then adding those sublists to another sublist of a matching set, then that sublists are placed in place of the standard leather set. This will guarantee that when an actor wearing leather spawns, it will always be the matching set, sometimes without helmets.
  
  
Also, this time I teamed up with [XilaMonstrr](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/126616023) so we have good and cleaned high-resolution textures from the get-go, as well as performance texture options for Potato PCs.. Make sure to check [her other upscaled texture mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/126616023?tab=user+files) too. Big thanks!

[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]***Q/A***[/font]**Will you do a UNP/BHUNP conversion?**
  
A:no, I won't. you will have to either do it yourself or wait for someone else to make one. I would love to suport every single body mod in existence but I do have a life to live :( .
  
  
**Does this work with Regular CBBE?**A: it should work fine, bodyslide files are also provided, but untested as for now. It is the same as the 3BA files but without the 3BA bones, should still work fine tho (again, I would do a propperly clean normal CBBE conversion if I had time and patience, doing those is quite a chore).
  
  
**Does this work with the Vanilla body?**
  
[font=Arial]A:it should. however I don't offer support to the vanilla body. its 2022, come on guys just download a unp/cbbe nevernude with a vanilla looking presset at least. expecting full suport for vanilla body is like expecting GTA 6 to be made for the PS2.[/font]
  
  
**[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]Can you release a version without the Trimmed/ skimpy armors?[/font]**
  
A:No. My mods are provided as is, and the skimpyness of my armors are pretty tame compared with what you see in this site,just take a look at skyrim's defaut bandit armors, they are skimpy, and you are not complaining.If you want to remove any armor of the pack, feel free to do so, but do it yourself, mod authors are not your maids.
  
  
**[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]Does this mod needs a bashed patch/ does it touch leveled lists?
  
[/font]**A: this time, no. I distributed the sets by ediding outfit data, to ensure maximum compatibility, no armor mismatches and a more organized distribution.
  
If you use the alternate plugin option, then yes, as it edits two NPC records.
  
  
[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]**Does this mod affects NPCs/ followers from other mods?**[/font]
  
A:if it is referencing the defaut leather outfits, then yes, it does, and thats one of the main reasons why I made this mod lol.
  
  
[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]**Why don't you do an SPID distribution or a fomod?**[/font]
  
A: Cause I don't know how to do that yet, I'm just a guy still learning how stuff works, have patience. XilaMonstrr released the SPID distribution plugin, grab it [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76026/).
  
  
**Why don't you port your mods to LE or XBOX?**
  
A: cause I don't have LE, and I don't have an XBOX. XilaMonstrr will be doing the LE backports of all my armor packs soon, as for the Xbox ports, you can grab then [here(1k-512)](https://bethesda.net/en/mods/skyrim/mod-detail/4291729) or [here(2k-1k)](https://bethesda.net/en/mods/skyrim/mod-detail/4291727)
