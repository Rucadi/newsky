You want more colors? We got 'em. Each ESL-flagged plugin contains:
  

  
* A metallic tint for armor pieces, shield, and weapons.
7 colors for the coif/trousers/tunic: original (green), black, blue, brown, burgundy, purple, and red.
  
* 4 colors for sword hilts: original (green), black, blue, and red.

  
Each color combination is standalone and may be used alongside other colors, including the base mod's green colors. Refer to the mod pictures for the tint names. If you don't like a tint, don't activate its plugin.
  
  
**Meshes** are provided by the [original Viridian Knight set](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71568), which you must have downloaded and enabled for these new plugins to work.
  
  
**Textures** have 1k, 2k, or 4k options. *Only one file is needed. You don't need to download all of them.*
  
  
**Compatibility**I've included standalone copies of the vanilla cubemaps used by this armor set to avoid incompatibility with the following:
  

  
* ENB dynamic cubemaps, by design, replaces vanilla cubemaps with a placeholder used to trigger dynamic cubemap reflections. This causes the colors to not show up as expected, as most of the metallic sheen comes from the cubemap and not the diffuse textures.
Legacy of the Dragonborn (LotD) v5 erroneously includes broken cubemaps that overwrite vanilla cubemaps (it was supposedly fixed in v6). This was causing the metallic colors that were using these vanilla cubemaps to look strange.
