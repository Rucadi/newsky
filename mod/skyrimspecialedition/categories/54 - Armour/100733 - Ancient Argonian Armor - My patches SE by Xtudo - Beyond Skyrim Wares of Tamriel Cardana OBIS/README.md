**My patches by Xtudo**

**Description**
  
**My edits for this wonderful armor made by 4thUnknown.**
  
  
**Fixes/tweaks**

  
* Changed to Heavy Armor footstep sound.
Carried-on Unofficial Patch fixes.
  
* Removed awesome testing chest from Riverwood. **:D**
Removed ITM record.
  
* Survival Mode Warm keyword added.
Some other minor fixes and tweaks.
  
* It's fine to install mid-game.

  
**Optional files**
  

  
* **Beyond Skyrim - Wares of Tamriel SE Addon**. Cardana will sell a full armor set. Standalone. It only requires the original mod's meshes and textures. All fixes already included. You can install it with the Main file too, no problem. ESL.
**Reduced Glow patches.** To 50% and to 25%. 4K-2K-1K versions available.
  
* **Unenchanted Boots and Helmet version**.
**OBIS (Organized Bandits In Skyrim Special Edition) SPID patch**. It will give the full set to 11 bounty Argonian named bosses added by OBIS. The armors are not playable. It requires SPID, and only the original meshes and textures. You can install it with the Main file too, no problem. ESL.
  
* **Inventory/Ground Items No Glow patch**. Ideal for mods like Helmet Toggle 2.
**Tail For All Races version**. ESP, ESL, Default and Unenchanted versions available.
