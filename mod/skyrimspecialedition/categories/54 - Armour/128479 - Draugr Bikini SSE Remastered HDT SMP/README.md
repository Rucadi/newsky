[kofman77 Draugr Bikini armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70648)﻿ reworked. 3BA only.
  
**Requires original mod^.**
  
  
Extra sliders, like for exaple Squeeze sliders, with "realistic" physics (gif below, no more jelly breastplate).
  
  
Added/made textures and implemented enviromental masks for (dynamic or normal) [cubemap](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/6392)﻿ reflections.
  
These are based on vanilla diffuse maps.
  
  
Some uv-map edits, and added smp for the loincloth and skirt.
  
Some minor things, like enabling backfaces for some meshes.
  
Two new alt versions for the leggings.
  
  
So basically similar treatment I gave to Tawoba 6.1 [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/111200)﻿.

**Installation:**
  
-Overwrite original
  
- Build it again in Bodyslide
  
  
Done.
  
  
**Optional (recommended) after that:**
  
 
  
- Select group "Draugr Bikini 3BA Xtra"
  
- Build one by one items with extra sliders
  
- Some of them are alt versions of same item, build only one.
  
  
Done.
  
  
Just a reminder, when building with extra sliders, like for example squeeze,
  
remember to view and adjust sliders for both, 0 and 100 weight.
  
  
Not sure if such texture replacers exist atm,
  
but If the env mask textures I have added in, have a conflict with another texture replacer,
  
I would test first with the one you have installed.
  
(So let the other texture replacer overwrite this)
  
These \_m textures control how the reflections will look, so it is subjective which you will use.
  
  
Also, about the different realistic breastplate options in the bodyslide,
  
They differ a bit, in terms of bone weights and such, for different physics setups.
  
I would suggest trying first the "squeeze realistic adjustedl".
  
(Above gif was built with that one, smp physics ingame)
  
  
Texture replacer used in pictures, [aMidianborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35382)﻿.
  
  
Not much else to say really, unless I forgot something.
