I have a strange infatuation with the East Empire Company, I have referenced them in several of my mods and I am sure I will continue to reference them in many mods to come. They have only ever really big a major player in Bloodmoon but I just find the faction to be very neat. I have long been disappointed that the Company doesn't have any kind of unique aesthetic in Skyrim. They look like any other Imperial soldier, but I felt like they needed something that really showed who they were.
  
  
[Jelidity](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/4569617) so kindly offered to kitbash some assets together and I think we have come up with a really neat looking armor set that really gives off that "Company feel" that I was looking for. This mod will integrate the lovely new armor set into Skyrim to give your East Empire Company a fresh coat of paint!

* East Empire Mercenaries now wear the new East Empire Company Armor.
East Empire Wardens now wear the new East Empire Company Armor.
  
* Adelaisa Vendicci now wears the new East Empire Company Armor without a helmet.
Orthus Endario now wears the new East Empire Company Jerkin.
  
* East Empire Wardens are now present in the East Empire Company Warehouse at all times, not only during Scoundrel's Folly.
The new East Empire Company Armor can be crafted after completing Rise in the East. It is Light Armor governed by the "Steel Smiting" perk.
