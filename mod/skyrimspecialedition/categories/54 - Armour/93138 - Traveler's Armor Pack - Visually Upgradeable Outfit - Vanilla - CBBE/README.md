 ﻿This mod adds a brand new set of light armor to the game, that is visually changed as you level up and craft upgrades. 
  
Starting from a simple casual outfit and progressively altered and upgraded into a sturdy defensive armor. 
  
  
 Inspired by games like Dragons Dogma and The Witcher 3, there are a few stages to this new attire.
  
Starting with a basic Casual Outfit, you can upgrade to a Padded Vest, a Full Gambeson, and finally a Armored Scale Chest Plate.
  
  
Boots, Gloves and a Hood (with a lowered variant) are also available, these can be upgraded to an enhanced version with the Advanced Armors perk, to match the fully upgraded armor in stats. 
  
  
 Everything is crafted at the blacksmith, and is available for males, females and includes full support for Argonians and Khajiit. 
  
  
This outfit was designed with the vanilla female body in mind, but CBBE bodyslide files are optionally included
  
An ESL flagged plug-in is also available for those who prefer
