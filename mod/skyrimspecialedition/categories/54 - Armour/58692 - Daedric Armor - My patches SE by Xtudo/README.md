﻿Daedric Armor - My patches**
  
**By Xtudo**

  
**Description**
  
**Several patches for this wonderful armor made by 4thUnknown.**
  
  
**Patches:**

  
* [Immersive Armors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3479)﻿ v8.1.
[Skyrim Immersive Creatures Special Edition](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12680)﻿ v7.0.2.
  
* Standalone version for the armor and blades (with the USSEP fixes included).
Standalone Vanilla version (you can forge the vanilla armor, so you won't loose it from your game, USSEP fixes included).
  
* More feminine versions.
Optional 2K Textures download added. Reduced the size of the textures, ideal for mid-range computers.
  
* Gray scale hair optional version added.
**OPEN FACE version**: Check the Optional downloads. 2K and 4K textures included. Female armor and helmet based in my "feminine" version. There is no savegame problem in changing versions. **Known problems**: It won't work for beast races. Long beards will clip though the helmet (a classical engine bug).
  
* Added Optional download that removes the red glow from the armor.
Added two new helmets, the Daedric Face of Demon and the Daedric Face of Terror, models made by [WyrmTitan99](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/61873446) (thanks you very much)!
  
* Optional **Alternative Armors - Daedric Mail replacer** added.

  
- [Legacy of the Dragonborn version here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58684), I prefer to keep it in a separated page.
  
- [LE version here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/109806). 
  
  
**Requirements**
  

  
* [Daedric Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58661) ﻿﻿by 4thUnknown. Only the textures folder (Data\Textures\1Daedric).
