- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/149259


This mod adds 12 items, 8 scarves, 1 neck gaiter and 3 hooded capes.
  
  
I have made some mods relies on 3D modeling by other people, and it made me want to do it from scratch by myself. It took some time(I downloaded Blender around 8 months ago...,) and here I present you these items.
  
Hope you enjoy.
  
  
  
  
  
  

**--> Items <--**

  
  
6(+1) models with 1 to 3 variations each.
  
All items have HDT-Physics except Neck Gaiter.
  
  
**Tight Scarf (Blue / Rough):**
  
Made for matching with heavy armors in mind, this scarf looks a bit floating when you wear with ordinary clothes.
  
  
**Patterned Scarf (Green / Akaviri):**
  
Most basic shape scarves with 2 patterns. This shape should match with many styles.
  
  
**Thick Scarf (Purple / Green / Dark)**:
  
With bigger shape and bigger back flap. For clothes & light armors.
  
  
**Plain Shawl Red:**
  
A little bit wide and natural shape for clothes. Many armors might clip somewhere.
  
  
**Neck Gaiter:**
  
Simple cloth cover to protect ya neck.
  
  
**Hooded Cape(Green / Red / Rough):**
  
This cape is for armors with rounded shoulder shape, and rough version has slightly different shape.
  
  
  
  
  
**--> Notes <--**
  
- These items are craftable with tanning racks(I want to make a patch to change this to the Spinning Wheel mod.)
  
- These items are all clothes items.
  
- Added warmth keywords for survival mods such as Survival Mode, Sunhelm and so on.
  
- Pre-built meshes included, you don't need to run the Bodyslide if you use OBody.
  
- HDT-SMP Physics has no collision setting, means this mod should be performance friendly.
  
 - All items uses 45 body slot as base, and the Hooded Capes also uses hair & long hair slots.
  
- Textures are 2k. I made in 4k but IMO it's too much for these small pieces in the game.
