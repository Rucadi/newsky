DISCLAIMER: PHYSICS HAVE NOW BEEN RESTORED
  
  
  
  
I  HATE [size=3][size=5]Myself. That's why I took it upon myself to convert all three armors from the Ferrum Nibenis mod to CBBE 3BA. So yeah, I wanna die now.
  
  
  
Anyway, there you have it. All three armors converted to 3BA, all for free.
  
Because that's what a good mod is: FREE.
  
  
Due to personal circumstances, I had to upload this in a hurry and didn't even get to test it, but I hope it works.
  
It will be at least a couple days before I can fix any bugs or start any conversions, so this is my parting gift for now.
