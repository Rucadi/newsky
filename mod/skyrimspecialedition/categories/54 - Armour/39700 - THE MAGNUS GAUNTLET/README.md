IMPORTANT! PLEASE READ!**This project was developed in December 2019 and finalized as this working prototype. It is not the full vision of what I wanted for this mod but due to life circumstances, I'm releasing this mod as it is now - due to the risk of this never being released, which would be a shame. Development on my side will likely not continue. 
  
**How to get the gauntlet?**
  
Well, I didn't make it easy. Purchase the 6 expensive gems from the Dremora Merchant in the Dragonborn DLC. [https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Dremora\_Merchant](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Dremora_Merchant )
  
Then craft the gauntlet with the Ebony smithing perk at the Skyforge in Whiterun. I do think this requires finishing the Companions questline. 
  
Please note this has not been extensively playtested. 
  
  
**Stats:**
  
The gauntlet increases destruction spell power by 100% and reduces spell costs for all schools by 100%. Now you don't have to drink destruction potions to play viably as a mage at any given time. It's also a heavy armour item that can be tempered enough to satisfy any armour requirement. It does not increase enchanting effectiveness at this time because I feel that would be game-breaking because of the enchanting/alchemy exploit. Imagine the need for the enchanting gem to bind the power of the other together I guess.
  
Works best at 100 character weight and designed with the arch-mage robes in mind. Female characters will have man-hands but it's not too noticable. Beast race compatible too.
  
  
**Permissions:**
  
I give full permission to anyone else to develop this mod further as a re-release.
  
But please credit me in your release :)
