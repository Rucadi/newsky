# Dwemer Armor SE - CBBE 3BA
- Author: ChronoTrigger77
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81602


**Mod Features:**
  
- NOT a quick Outfit Studio conversion!  This was carefully reshaped to the CBBE/3BA body in blender.
  
- The skirt and skirt armor have been combined to be a single layer with front leg openings.  This improves animation.
  
- Boots, Gauntlets, and Helmet all adjusted to CBBE as well.
  
- Reweighted to optimize for CBBE with (most) 3BA weights and remove clipping where possible.
  
- Maintains Xtudo's fixes - weight slider, beast races, helmet gap etc.
  
- Includes new CBBE meshes, generated with Bodyslide (CT77 Preset).  Run Bodyslide with your chosen preset to overwrite these if you prefer!
  
- Subtle breast bounce, butt bounce and belly/leg bounce supported with 3BA and 3BA
  
srequired files.
  
- Option to install without physics (Just CBBE required) added in version 2.0
  
- Optional Vanilla Replacer for female Dwarven armor - make sure to install Xtudo's version first.
  
- Optional CC Dwarven Mail Replacer added in 2.0 - make sure to install Xtudo's version first.
  
- Optional CC Dwarven Plate Replacer added in 2.0 - make sure to install Xtudo's version first.
  
- Optional Replacer for the "Immaculate Armor" (female) from "The Forgotten City" - make sure to install Xtudo's version first.
