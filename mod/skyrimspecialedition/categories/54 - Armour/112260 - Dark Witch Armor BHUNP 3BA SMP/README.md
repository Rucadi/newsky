This mod adds a gothic-style dress to Skyrim. The dress also comes with medieval armor parts. The outfit is light armor. There are four parts.
  
-Dark Witch Armor
  
-Dark Witch Gauntlets
  
-Dark Witch Boots
  
-Dark Witch Choker
  
  
This armor can be crafted at the forge with the Advanced Armors perk. These crafted versions have no enchantments. Enchanted versions can be bought. The Choker has a very special enchantment. It's therefore rarer to find at vendors. Instead, a guaranteed version can be found as hand-placed loot in a vanilla dungeon. Good luck finding it!
  
  
The plugin is an .esp flagged .esl.
  
  
This outfit has optional 4k textures. As the 2k textures look really good, even up close, the 4k textures are highly recommended for screenarchers. They won't be necessary for general gameplay. All the preview screenshots use the 2k textures. BHUNP and 3BA support.
