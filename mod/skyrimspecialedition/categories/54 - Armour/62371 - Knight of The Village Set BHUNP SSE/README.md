﻿After almost more than 6 months I was on hiatus, I decided to make another armor mod, because I had nothing to do.
  
To be honest I'm not really on hiatus, I'm looking for armor design inspiration by playing ESO, but because I'm an idiot, instead of getting Inspiration I'm busy grinding my character on ESO.
  
  
Finally I googled armor designs and got this.

If you already have all the Requirements.
  
  
Install this armor using Vortex or **Mod Organizer 2**
  
(Mod Organizer 2 will read the "CalienteTools" folder automatically)
  
  
*maybe you can just use the manual method,
  
  
by extracting all the files in the Main File
  
into The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition / Data
  
but in my opinion using Mod Manager is much easier
  
and even MO2 doesn't contaminate
  
your game data folder*
  
after that,
  
  
1.Open Bodyslide
  
2. Check Build Morph﻿﻿
  
3. **﻿**Hit batch build!
  
4. You will see the list
