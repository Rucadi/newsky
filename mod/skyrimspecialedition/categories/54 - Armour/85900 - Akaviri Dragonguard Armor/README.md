I may have bit off more than I can chew with this one. I'm very happy with how the armor turned out but there's still a few issues with clipping and stretching in some areas. I did the best I could implementing it but there's only so much you can do for Skyrim and I have very little experience with implementing 3D assets.
  
  
You can find the armor and sword in a chest in the courtyard of Sky Haven Temple. It's heavy armor and has similar stats to Dragonbone.
  
  
The armor originally had a very high poly count so my buddy Scarecro0w reduced it for me to an amount Skyrim can handle and I did the rest of the work from there. You can find the original armor here: https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/crimson-samurai-2b9adce3d38e45b0a5250b05695653f5
