**Armor inspired by the old "Tes Arena," it's basically a Bikini armor.
  
  
The mod is simple, the armor as in the pics, is composed of: Top, Undertop, Gloves, Thong, and Boots.
  
  
All items have a slider for tightening effect (look for [Predator] at the start of some sliders, and the top also has edited weight paint, making it more realistic.
  
  
Original version is in Black like the old Game, and also a "Dye" version to be used with the dye manager function of "Screen Archer Menu (SAM) for Skyrim" or the old and original "Dye Manager" mod, both work to color the armor the way you want in the game.
  
Yes... you can make the armor any color you want in the game.
  
  
You can change the base color of any item, as the stiches color, metals color, laces, and on the boots you can also change the sole/heels color.
  
  
The armor can also be crafted and upgraded.
