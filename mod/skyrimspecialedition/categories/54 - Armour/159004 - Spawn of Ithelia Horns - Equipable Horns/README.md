Skip to Description if TLDR :)﻿

  

**﻿LORE START**

**When Ithelia tore the veil, shard of her divine essence fell across Nirn.
  
Some minor ones hardened into grotesque relics, twisting into horned shapes of power and corruption
  
These became known by being frequently used by her Spawn.****Those who don them are said to hear whispers of the lost god's will.
  
Each pair carries a different fragment of her essence, warping mortal flesh and spirit.
  
Some see them as a kind of cursed ornaments, others as sacred relics of a god long forgotten and now rememberred
  
  
LORE END**
