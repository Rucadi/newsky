**COLOVIAN PRINCE SET**

**My patches by Xtudo**

**Description**
  
**My patches and tweaks for this amazing mod..**
  

  
* Full beast races support for the helmet.
New more feminine female helmet version, it was the male version before.
  
* Fixed cape model and textures.
Fixed weight 100 female gloves and boots.
  
* Fixed first person female armor model.
Amulets are now concealed.
  
* Added missing blood decals to the axe.
Improved collision of all ground items.
  
* Fixed the invisible ground armor item.
Added "Warm" keyword for the Survival Mode.
  
* ESL file that works with any Skyrim version. It will replace the original ColovianPrince.esl file.
The default Main Fixes file is fully compatible with 3BA, SAM or similar patches. Just install them after my files.
  
* **Optional Non-HDT**patch. All fixes already included. Non compatible with 3BA or similar patches.
**Optional Helmet See Trough Eyes** patch. Requires one of the Main files installed first.
  
* **Optional Heavy Armor version.** It adds an extra heavy armored version, while keeping the original light as well. So, you will have the two versions available in-game. Ebony tier. Ebony Smithing Crafting Perk required. Requires one of the Main files installed first. It's safe to install mid-game, you won't loose any already crafted item.
**Optional Only Heavy Armor version**. It doesn't include the light armor version.
  
* **Optional Vanilla Steel Armor replacer.** Requires one of the Main files installed first.

  
**I made it for my game and now I'm sharing it, I hope you like it.**- [LE version here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/117542).
