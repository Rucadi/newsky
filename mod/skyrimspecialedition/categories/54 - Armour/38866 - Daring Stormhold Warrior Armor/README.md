[font=Georgia]This is an adaptation of the original [Stormhold Warrior Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/95661?tab=description) for Argonians to the human female body published with permission of the original author [SoN6of6TrediS](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/2485522).[/font][font=Georgia]
  
  
  
[size=5]Features:
  
  
[size=4]This version of the armor includes:
  
Cuirass
  
Gauntlets
  
The armor has no boots (as the original has no boots). The boots in the screenshots are the Mercenary's Boots from the Triss Armor which fit the style quite well.
  
  
The cuirass has Zap-sliders:
  
- for the shorts allowing wearing the armor as a "skirt"
  
- and for the top, allowing the use of an alternative top of your choice (not included).
