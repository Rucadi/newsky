How to use?:
  
Open BodySlide, search for the desired armor piece and open the preview window. Now choose the parts you want to hide and click on build.

**Combined Armor**
  
  
- The full armor set has 14 separate pieces. You can reduce the item count to 4 pieces by combining them at a smithing forge.

**Metal and fabric colors**
  
  
- In the fomod installer you can choose from 9 different metal styles.
  
- For the fabric (panty and top) there are 4 colors for a non transparent version and 2 transparent versions. So 12 options in fact.
  
  
  
**Crafting/Balance**
  
  
**Crafting**
  
  
**- Important note!** - To craft/combine the armor at a smithing forge you need a special smithing hammer. 
  
  Otherwise the set won't show up in the crafting list! The idea is to keep your armor crafting list clean. For armor upgrades it is not needed.
  
  It can be found in the East Empire Company Warehouse at the Solitude docks. For the exact location check the "Location" section below.
  
  
- All outfit parts can be enchanted and upgraded (the panty can't be upgraded)
  
  
**Balance**
  
  
- In the fomod installer you can choose from 2 categories for the esp: Balance or default.
  
- default: the armor gets pretty overpowerd at the time you upgrade it (this is due to how Skyrim handles the upgrading bonuses).
  
- balanced: only  breastplate, sabatons and gloves can be upgraded. The other parts still have a little bit of armor rating but cant' be
  
  upgraded  (it was the only and cleanest way I could think of to balance it for the smithing perks). 
  
  
- If you wonder why, here is the explanation: (unimportant for the mod)  Spoiler
  
If you upgrade an armor to legendary there is a multiplier for the armor rating but also a added bonus. For cuirass it's 20 and for every other part it's 10.
  
So with 11 pieces (including cuirass) the set gets a bonus of 120 armor rating. A vanilla set (4 pieces) gets 50.
  
Additionally the multipliers get nerfed on higher base ratings.
  
A part with an ebony material keyword and 1 armor rating has 14 armor on legendary when the player has a heavy armor skill of 15 without perks (In game it has 2 armor, a ~ 1.8 multiplier and a + 10 bonus).
  
A daedric part with 20 armor has 32 on legendary (should have a 2.0 multiplier but has in fact a + 10 bonus and a 1.1 multiplier).
  
Daedric cuirass with 52 has 77 when legendary (also 1.1 multiplier but 20 cuirass bonus)
  
Result: daedric gloves, boots and cuirass started at 92 armor and has 141 total on legendary quality.
  
My set with 11 pieces started at 22 armor and has 164 total on legendary quality.
  
  
Long story short: Since my set has so many pieces there is no way to balance it for early, mid and endgame.
  
So my solution and why I made the balance esp as it is (only the 3 main parts can be tempered) should make a bit more sense now.
  
I personally recommend the default esp since on legendary quality and a good heavy armor skill you will reach the damage reduction cap with any vanilla armor anyway.
  
The balance esp is good for you if you want more consistent values.
  
Of course you always can play around with the ratings in the esp yourself and change it to your personal likings.
