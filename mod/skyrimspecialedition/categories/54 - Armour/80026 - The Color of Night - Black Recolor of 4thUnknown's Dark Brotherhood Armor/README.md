**Main version:**
  
Same resolution as 4thUnknown's original mod (4k - 2k) with all details of his texture preserved. Main file includes the red hand on the pauldron shown in the screenshots. Grey hand version also available, which is also the same resolution as original, as well as 2K and 1K versions of both.
  
  
Replaces vanilla Shrouded Armor. Only the retexture is included in the main file, original mod needed for meshes. No .esp, just overwrite when prompted during installation.
  
  
**Standalone:**
  
 Made to work with Dark Brotherhood Armor Standalone by Korodic from the original mod page. Armor is craftable at the forge after joining the Dark Brotherhood and if you have the Arcane Blacksmith perk. Currently only 4k - 2k resolution is available for the standalone.
  
**Recommended Mods:**[CBBE - Physics Bodyslide - Dark Brotherhood Armor SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74251) - Works with the replacer versions of this mod.
  
[Arnbjorn wears 4th Unknown Dark Brotherhood Armor - Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78657)﻿ - Makes Arnbjorn use this and not sleeveless version of the ugly vanilla Shrouded Armor.
  
  
**Future Plans:**
  
FOMOD installer, and possibly (probably) one or two alternative shades for the cloth in case it's too dark or not dark enough for most people.
  
  
Credit and thanks to 4thUnknown for the original, as well as Korodic for making the standalone file mine is based on; all assets used with permission.
