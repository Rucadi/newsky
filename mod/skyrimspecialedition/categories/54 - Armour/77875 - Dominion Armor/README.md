**FAQ:
  
    Q: How do I acquire the armor in game?
  
    A**: You can craft the armor at the forge. You need the Steel Smithing Perk. To craft the runes, you need 50 enchanting.
  
  
    **Q: The shield is blocking my view!
  
    A:** Yes, the design does block some of the view in first person. I'd recommend reducing your games depth of field if playing with it.
  
  
    **Q: Why isn't this armor for UUNP or CBBE?**
  
    **A:** I don't like using bodyslide.
