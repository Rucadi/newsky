# Sir Rumple - Azure Knight Armor - 3BA - SMP
- Author: Sir Rumple
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/150797


Original mod is required
  
I only made the Heavy Armor version since looking at the size of the armor part, it made sense for me
  
The mod comes with Bodyslide files and pre-built meshes with the CBBE Curvy shape (It's what I used in the screen shots)
  
Plugin is flagged as ESL so it will not take an extra space in your load order
  
High Heel sound patch now in optional files
