1. INTRODUCTION
  
===============
  
  
Many years ago, a modder by the handle FallenJudge made a Tsun armor with a bikini top. I made use of it, and refined it considerably for my own use over time. I got permission to release my enhanced version... back in the original 32-bit Skyrim days. And never did.
  
  
Fast forward to SSE time. After having replaced from Vanilla meshes or recreated the few parts remaining that were FallenJudge's from scratch (basically just the steel boob plates spliced from the Steel armor and reshaped), it no longer has any such issues.
  
  
I then sat on it again for too long, adapted it to CBBE, ported it to SSE and its iteration of CBBE, and then adapted it to CBBE 3BA. Finally, I now get around to releasing it.
  
  
Additionally, it has the following improvements:
  
  
\* Subdivided boobplates and arm rings (NOT the torcs) to solve any low-poly unshapelyness. Additional insertion of some edges on the hip oval things (not full-blown subdivision) to reduce low-poly pointiness.
  
\* Improved strap textures (derived from the vanilla Barmaid outfit's)
  
\* A neck halter strap (again from the Barmaid outfit)
  
\* A choice of a bikini or low-back strap (or topless)
  
\* Furliners on the boob platse
  
\* Further lowering of the lower armor waistline
  
\* A fur underwear mesh courtesy of Ralfetas and their Panties of Skyrim mod
  
\* CBBE 3BA physics function (version 2.0.6 body model used, some jiggly parts de-jigglified due to clipping)
  
\* Separated forearm rings to function as arm armor
  
\* Resized boots
  
\* BodySlide function (with complementary slider presets that I use with it)
  
\* Vanilla-pathed parts for all applicable cases (only exceptions: Ralf's panties and the top straps). Pictured in screenshots are CaBaL120's aMidianBorn textures for the Tsun armor and steel boob plates
  
  
===============
  
2. INSTALLATION
  
===============
  
  
Place the module, meshes, textures, and CalienteTools folders in your SSE installation's Data folder. Activate the module to use the pre-generated body files (provided BS presets used, low-back strap option). Generate your own with BodySlide.
  
  
The module is an ESLified ESP, so it will occupy the ESL load order range.
  
  
Keep in mind that I optimized the shape to my own (bundled) BodySlide slider presets, so it might have some distortion or clipping issues with others.
  
  
To acquire in-game, you must have Advanced Armors smithing perk and access to the Sky Forge.
  
The required components comprise of steel ingots, iron ingots, leather, leather straps... and a cave bear pelt. You have the option of heavy or light armor.
  
They will be considered Scaled or Steel Plate in terms of material-related armor perks.
  
  
This armor was not designed for use by male characters, so it may not function properly in that case.

4. VERSION HISTORY
  
==================
  
  
v1:
  
Initial release
  
  
v1.1 (July 31, 2021)
  
\* Got the 3BA BodySlide setup sorted out. Created with BodySlide 5.4.1 and 3BA v2.0.6.
  
\* 3BA Old v1.5X compatibility BodySlide set available. Made with materials from 3BA v1.55.
  
\* Transferred the vanilla male body meshes updated to match the mod's armor setup from Tathrin's vanilla body patch.
  
  
v1.2 (August 5, 2021)
  
\* Reconformed the leg plates to reduce leg jiggle clipping on the 3BA versions. Spotted when running towards the cam with True Directional Movement.
  
\* Realized after I started labeling version info in this update with a number that it should have just been v1.1.1 Ahwell. This is v1.2 moving forward.
  
  
v1.2.1 (August 6, 2021)
  
\* Undid a leftover BSDismemberSkinInstance partition change from some mesh tinkering. The bug will manifest as a missing loincloth in v1.2.
  
  
v1.2.2 (August 16, 2021)
  
\* The crafting recipe for heavy boots mistakenly pointed to light boots.
  
\* File type extension in the ARMA file path to the male armor was missing, making it an invalid path.
  
\* Heavy boots were incorrectly keyworded as light armor.
  
  
v1.2.3 (October 28, 2022)
  
\* Light torso piece was incorrectly keyworded as Heavy armor.
  
\* Gauntlets had Survival warm clothes keywords on them when they are definitely not warm and insulative.
