Hello!
  
  
After creating the silver armor replacer mod, a lot of you guys in the comments section wanted a standalone version of it, so here it is! (Yes, we read all the comments :) )
  
  
This mod does not require any other mods or in game contents. **This armor is just a MALE armor. We did not create a female variant.**
  
  
This armor is called Silver Bone Armor and can be crafted or added into your own loot management system if you are using any. Currently this mod does not come with any bodyslide options or physics options. If you want to see these features as well, write it on the comments. This mod itself was the result of some other comments, after all. Some cool options may include different skirt color options etc. I don't know, you think, we can make it happen.
  
  
Look at these amazing, 3D mesh details:
