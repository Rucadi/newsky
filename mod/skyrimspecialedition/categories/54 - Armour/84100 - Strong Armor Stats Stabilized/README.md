# Strong Armor Stats Stabilized

So, you see a great-looking armor mod on Nexus.  You think, "man, I want that in my game, NOW."  However, after downloading your new armor, your level 1 character now has an endgame-worthy set from the moment they leave Helgen! 
  
  
Luckily, S.A.S.S. is here to save the balance of your game!
  
  
This page contains plugins which attempt to accomplish one main goal: rebalancing the armor ratings around vanilla, based on the difficulty in obtaining the materials used for creating them.  So, for instance, if a new armor is made with leather and leather strips, it will have a leather rating, not Daedric.
  
  
In addition, in some cases, I will also introduce other small tweaks.  This will occur when
  
  
1.  Maintaining the "vision" of the mod.  If the armor is intended to be used as high-tier armor, then it will remain so.  However, the requirements for obtaining the armor will be increased.  Ebony-level armor created at a magic forge, for example, will require that the spell used to craft the gear be much more expensive than a normal novice-level spell.
  
  
and
  
  
2. Introducing other balancing methods into the mod.  For example, locking the armor away behind quest requirements, level requirements, or perk requirements.  These changes will be clearly noted.
