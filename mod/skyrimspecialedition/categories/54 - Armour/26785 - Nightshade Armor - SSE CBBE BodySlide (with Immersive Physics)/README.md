This is, as already mentioned above, the SSE CBBE BodySlide version of the outfit.
  
**What is immersive physics? Means whichever makes sense for the nature of the outfit. In this case, only butt physics are applied.**
  
  
New recolours: Blue, Green, Purple.
  
Fur version only has cuirass (as in original mod). Use it in Skimpy version (removed chainmail), together with **Forsworn boots and gauntlets**.
  
  
**Most of the pictures are using NORMAL version so open BodySlide and please tick the zap option for SKIMPY version before build!**

Designed for use as an assassin. Gloves, Boots, Armor and Mask options all available in one download. Mask comes in 3 flavors, full, no neck, and neck only.
  
  
Where is it?
  
It can be crafted at a smithy (found under "misc") or you can use the console.
  
  
What are the stats? 
  
Roughly similar to glass armor.

A: Feel free to send me PM for the request. However, I will do it ONLY if I like the suggested mod AND if I have time to do so. Also:
  
- not excessively skimpy (e.g. bikini mods)
  
- not kinky
  
- not having extra long skirt (because I'm too lazy unless I really like them)
  
- the original author is still active, or the mod has open permission
  
- it won't require several permissions from different authors
  
- I need to remind you that **I have no obligation to comply to your request(s)**.

[size=5]**Quick Guide for newbies**
  
SpoilerIf you want Physics, make sure you have these installed:
  
[CBP Physics](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13207)﻿ OR [CBPC - CBP Physics with Collisions for SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21224)﻿
  
[FNIS SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3038/?)﻿
  
[XPMSSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1988)﻿
  
  
1. Install [CBBE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/198)﻿.
  
1a. (Recommended) Install Normal Map Options for more variety ("muscles and bigger/smaller breast shapes"), still in CBBE's download page in optional files.
  
1b. (Optional) Install [Diffuse Map Options](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12649)﻿ for even more variety ("clean or dirty skin, pubic hair variations, and nipple choices").
  
  
2. Install ONE of CBBE-compatible body textures found [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/198/?tab=forum&topic_id=6037653)﻿.
  
2a. I'm currently using [Fair Skin Complexion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/798)﻿ (for CBBE)
  
  
and then let the CBBE-compatible body textures overwrite the files.
  
  
3. Install CBBE related outfits (mostly bodyslide compatible) found [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/198/?tab=forum&topic_id=6037653)﻿.
  
  
4. Install [Bodyslide and Outfit Studio](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/201)﻿.
  
  
5. A lot of choice here! Install [CBBE Presets Compendium](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11229)﻿.
  
5a. (Optional) and of course my body preset [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24153) and [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15360).
  
and many more on nexus! 
  
  
Now we need to generate clothes and armor with the preset of your choice.
  
6. Open BodySlide (You need first to search the location with details can be found in the mod's description, and then launch).
  
  
7. On top left, "Outfit/Body", choose **CBBE Body** (static) OR **CBBE Body Physics** (if you want Physics).
  
  
8. On top left, "Preset", choose whatever preset you want to use for your player (if female) and female NPCs.
  
You can edit the presets and create your own CBBE-based body type. Don't forget to "Save As"
  
  
9. On bottom left, click "Batch build". By this time you must have all the armor mods already installed. 
  
  
If you later add more CBBE clothes/armors, you just need to load the group of said outfit and then batch build. Also, vanilla armor/clothes will match whatever preset you choose. 
  
  
You don't need mod for vanilla armor/clothes in CBBE.
  
  
If you want to have Physics, don't forget to choose the physics option during batch build process.
  
  
My personal choice: [360 Walk and Run Plus AND YY Animations SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7446)﻿. Tick the BBP option during installation. Then don't forget to run FNIS!
  
And done!
