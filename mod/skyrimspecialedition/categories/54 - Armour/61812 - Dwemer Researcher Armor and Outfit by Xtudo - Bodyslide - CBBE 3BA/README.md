Original armor by [Xtudo](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58180) still required. This is just BodySlide files.
  
  
[size=3]Just run bodyslide and have fun. But I will be honest - I haven't mastered conversion and weighting yet so its probably not perfect conversion. All visible clipping has been fixed. Weighting in certain areas might be off (this is why I made no physics variant too).
  
  
Two versions available:
  
[/size]

  
* Full physics - butt cape has no HDT physics so jiggle might look weird in certain areas.
Reduced physics - breasts, butt, thighs, belly bones removed.
  
  

  
Known issues:
  

  
* this outfit is not really pose friendly as you can see on screenshots, in gameplay it doesn't clip nearly as much. I will try to further improve it in the future
dwemer plate on front might clip with thighs during walking animation.
  
  
* armored variant cape clips with left leg in certain poses. I would have to drastically increase mesh volume of cape to fix it, but it would create other issues.
shoe size doesn't match CBBE feet size, I decided to not reshape it because it could end as an abomination.
