For the recipes to appear in the crafting interface you need to have the [crafting manual](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/4482/4482-1557279857-99510430.png)﻿﻿ in your inventory!

The inspiration for this and most of my outfit mods came from [Minidresses Collection mod by Tiwa44](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/47376/) who did an awesome job converting some of the long dresses to mini versions.
  
  
**A big THANK YOU to all who donate, endorse, comment or just play using this and the previous mods!**... winter is ... sorry ... more outfits are coming ... ;)
