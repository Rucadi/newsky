(endorse both mods please)
  
  
You need both mods.
  
Bodyslide conversion for BHUNP and 3ba
  
Doesn't include physics on the chest for obvious reasons.
  
  
The bhunp version is better since I smoother the chest area a bit. 
  
3ba doesn't include a smoother chest. That version was done a long time ago. Sorry.
