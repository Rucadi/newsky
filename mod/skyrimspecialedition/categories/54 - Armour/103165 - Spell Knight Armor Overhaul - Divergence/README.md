A Spell Knight Armor Overhaul, which includes 3 new Light Armor variants, crafting recipes, and level list distribution. Textures provided by TXTEC.
  
  
Armors are craftable with their respective crafting perks. CC quest is only required to be completed in order to craft the enchanted versions of the Ebony and Glass armor sets.
  
  
Armor stats and crafting recipes are equivalent to their vanilla armor counterparts. Armors can also be broken down at a smelter for their ingots.
  
  
Distribution to level lists is done via script and compatible with all other Level List mods. Armors will appear as loot, but not at vendors at the same level as their vanilla equivalents.
