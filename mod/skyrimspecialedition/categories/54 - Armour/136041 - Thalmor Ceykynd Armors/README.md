The Ceykynd, Aldmeri for Shadow Child, are a sect of assassins from Summerset highly debated to even exist. Officially, the Thalmor deny the existence of such a faction. However, their ties to the organization are clearly evident. Outspoken nobles or lords who dare decry the Thalmor’s influence and those who cannot be stuffed with gold or persuaded with blackmail often find themselves facing a sudden and untimely demise to shadowy figures that vanish as quickly as they appear. The only evidence of their visit being an ebony token of a raven left on the victim's body.

This mod adds a new armor set, two weapons, 2 loading screens and new Thalmor enemy type.
  
  
The armor and its variants are on par with ebony. While the dagger and sword both do slightly more crit damage than their Ebony counterparts. You'll find the armor on Thalmor Ceykynd or by crafting it with the Ebony Smithing perk.
  
  
The Ceykynd should be injected into the Thalmor soldier enemy list and should start spawning after level 20. Elenwen has one as a personal bodyguard and another will ambush you in her quarters during Diplomatic Immunity.
