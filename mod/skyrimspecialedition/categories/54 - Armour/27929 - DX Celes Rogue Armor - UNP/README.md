You can find the crafting manual in Riften inside the Ragged Flagon.
  
  
This outfit needs a bit of preparation, first you need to make black dye
  
using a **cooking station** and then make black leather using a **tanning rack**.
  
The ingredients you will be needing is Canis Root, Snowberries and Void Salts.
  
The black dye can also be used as a poison on your weapon.
  
  
All the recipes will only be available as long as you carry the crafting manual in your inventory.
  
When you are done crafting store the manual and your crafting interface will be free again.

A new light leather armor suited for stealthy characters.
  
  
  
  
[i][font=Times New Roman]It has better stats than a normal leather armor and the individual parts offer nice bonuses.
  
  
[i][font=Times New Roman]• The belt offers 25% better chance at picking pockets and 25% more one handed damage.[/font]*
  
• The bag offers 100 more carry weight and 25% easier lockpicking.
  
• The skirt offers 25% better sneaking.
  
*[font=Times New Roman]• The dagger is equal to an ebony dagger.

I made this outfit using this wonderful painting by Luis Royo as inspiration
  
"The Serpent's Tongue"

:)
  
  
A small trivia, I wanted to make the black dye craftable at the alchemy
  
station since it's a poison that you can also apply to your weapon, why didn't I?
  
  
TL;DR version: It's a nightmare adding stuff to the alchemy station.
  
  
Long version: The alchemy station works automatically by combining ingredients.
  
If I wanted to make a custom potion/poison like the black dye I would have to provide new
  
ingredients like black berries for example. Then I would have to plant bushes around Skyrim
  
to have black berries. Then, after I  would have made this mod about as incompatible as it can be
  
with other mods out there, I would have been able to make custom potions with custom materials.
  
So yeah, cooking station it is lol :D

The inspiration for this and most of my outfit mods came from [Minidresses Collection mod by Tiwa44](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/47376/) who did an
  
awesome job converting some of the long dresses to mini versions.
