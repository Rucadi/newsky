Five skulls of dark magic rest inside the Halls of the Dead in Windhelm.
  
They contain the knowledge to craft powerful Necromancer outfits!
  
  
(you can loot them of course and as long as you have one or more
  
of them in your inventory you can craft the corresponding colors)

• All robes have an opaque and transparent craftable version.
  
  
• The Claws, Boots, Blindfold and Amulet can be enchanted normally.
  
  
• Robes reduce mana requirements for all schools of magic by 15% and offer 100% mana regeneration.
  
  
• The staff [i][font=Times New Roman]reduces mana requirements[/font]* for conjuration and destruction magic by another 15%
  
and offers an additional 100 mana.

• The request for the creation of this outfit came from dianka33. Many Thanks! <3

• This outfit was made entirely in Blender.
  
  
• Every single mesh was made from scratch and it's unique to Skyrim.
  
(apart from vanilla Skyrim skulls)

• All textures were hand painted in Photoshop from the Diffuse,
  
Specular, Reflection, Glow, to the Height maps.

• The outfit was made using Blender, Outfit Studio, Nifscope, Photoshop and Crazy Bump.
  
  
  
• All the recipes will only be available as long as you carry the skulls in your inventory.
  
When you are done crafting store the skulls and your crafting interface will be free again.

\* Some clarifications about texture sizes because we've seen a lot of discussions about them in the comments. \*
  
  
Please open the full size and see it at 100%

The texture resolution refers to the outfit itself. Not the screen/desktop resolution of your monitors.
  
The above comparison image was taken at 1920x1080 and even here you can see the differences.
  
  
The big number refers to all the textures that are currently loaded and their total resolution.
  
The small number refers to how much memory these textures take up in the graphics card.
  
  
• We recommend 22K for 4K monitors, screen-archery or any GFX with more than 4GB memory.
  
5x4K 1x2K
  
  
• 11K for normal gameplay, 2K monitors and 2GB or more GFX.
  
5x2K 1x1K
  
  
• And the 5.5K ... for less than 2GB GFX ~~but it's hard to believe they still exist! :3~~
  
(looking at the downloads apparently they do, so yeah, 5.5K for you guys)
  
5x1K 1x512
  
  
And as comparison, think that only the vanilla Skyrim skull (ONLY THE SKULL) uses a 2K texture.
  
Then it's easy to understand that an entire armor with many individual parts requires 20K
  
or more for a consistent level of detail for every possible viewing angle and zoom. ;)

You can use assets of this armor inside Skyrim SE Nexus as long as you credit our work in the comments and you
  
don't make an almost duplicate of this mod. Meaning, this armor can be used to dress followers or be part of
  
a bigger project and assets like parts of this armor can be used to supplement your own armor creations.
  
  
Please don't copy the textures if you are making a conversion.
