[font=bebas\_neuebook]**ABOUT THE MOD**[/font]This shield was originally crafted for my previous mod featuring the Golden Order armor. At first, I intended to include it as an optional file, but it turned out far too glorious (in my humble opinion), so I decided it deserved its own standalone release.
  
According to legend, the shield was bestowed by the High Magister upon the captain of a knightly order, who valiantly reclaimed a vital stronghold from the clutches of the undead.
  
Now, the shield lies sealed within Meridia’s tomb. Should you seek it, prepare for peril — and an adventure worthy of song.

The finest mages of the Golden Order conjured a sunborn light and bound it within this shield, granting its bearer unyielding protection of the light.

It is said the ruby turns dark intent back upon the sender, shielding its bearer from harm. Many believe it awakens foresight and sharpens the gift of intuition. A stone that stirs the life within, and fills the soul with vigor.
