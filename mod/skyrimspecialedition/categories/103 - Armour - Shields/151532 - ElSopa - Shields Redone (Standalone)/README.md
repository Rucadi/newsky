ElSopa - Shields Redone (Standalone)

  
This is a fairly simple mod that takes ElSopa's excellent [Shields Redone - Part I](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99142) and converts them into standalone craftable shields, rather than replacing the originals. This allows for greater compatibility with other retextures or mods that add variants using the same base model (such as [Sentinel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/100985)). Additionally, full Sentinel distribution is available through a patch on my [Sentinel - Unofficial Patches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120963)﻿ page. All shields have the same stats as their base counterparts, and, if Skypatcher is installed, will automatically match the weight/protection stats should another mod change the base shield. 
  
  
Installation:
  

  
* Install [ElSopa - Shields Redone - Part I](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99142)﻿
Delete the "meshes" folder from his mod
  
* Install my mod and enable the plugin.
Optionally, download the patch from [Sentinel - Unofficial Patches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120963)﻿
  

  
That's it! Pretty simple, hope you enjoy!
