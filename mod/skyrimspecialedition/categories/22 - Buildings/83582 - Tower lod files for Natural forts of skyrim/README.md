Admittedly I don't know anything really about doing this, just kinda removed most of the main meshes stuff in nifskope except for the bstrishapes, so they won't be like super optimized lod files, but considering how few forts there are in skyrim, it shouldn't really make a difference. But I tested it myself, and I can see them perfectly from far away.
