﻿**- Mod Description -**[font=Trebuchet MS][/font]
  
A lore-friendly overhaul of Castle Dour featuring an expansion of the main castle cell to include the castle tower, which was visible from the exterior, but was previously missing in the interior. There's a barracks for a few imperial soldiers, as well as a bed and chest for the player that becomes available should the player officially join the Legion, as well as an auxiliary kitchen and some crafting stations. A cook and 2 generic Imperial soldiers were added for ambiance; one soldier will work at the entrance desk, the other will work in the crafting area of the tower, and they will use the beds in the tower and the tower's auxiliary kitchen in the evening before bed. Added a bedroom for Legate Adventus Caesennius. Added a bedroom for the player next to Legate Adventus Caesennius's bedroom that becomes available once the player is promoted to Legate. Added an office for General Tullius and a new bedroom that oversees the war room below. Added an Alchemy and Enchanting crafting space and additional clutter."
