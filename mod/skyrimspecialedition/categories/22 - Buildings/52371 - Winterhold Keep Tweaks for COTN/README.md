[font=Georgia]**Winterhold Keep Tweaks**
  
for Cities of the North - Winterhold[/font]

  
I am a huge fan of [JPSteel2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/19519279)'s [Cities of the North - Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40088) and you should be, too. The mod uses new meshes with vanilla texture paths to create a beautiful town that adjusts automatically to your graphical setup. It's got tons of patches, great level design, and really creative features. One design choice that I really liked was changing the Jarl of Winterhold's seat from a generic longhouse to a new fortress in the mountains. However, I noticed a few design choices that I thought could be reworked, such as the use of various other tilesets for certain assets, a sort of clunky name, and some clipping objects, among other things.
  
  
Therefore, I created this mod to unify the castle into the Windhelm tileset art style and make a few subjective fixes and tweaks that I believe bring out the best in this beautiful building. This mod contains no textures; just like COTN Winterhold itself, it uses the textures you have installed (Windhelm textures, specifically) to make its tweaks. My screenshots use [Noble Skyrim 2K](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21423). It should be fully compatible with any texture mods you have installed. These tweaks do not affect the base objects that they retexture--only the ones inside the castle itself. The plugin is ESL-flagged and shouldn't take up a plugin slot.
  
  
This mod was originally created for [Pierre Despereaux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/61720101)'s [Keizaal](https://keizaal.github.io/Keizaal/) Modding Giveaway.
  
  

[font=Georgia]List of Changes[/font]

  

  
* The castle has been renamed from '*Stonecold Fortress*' to '*Longwinter Watch*'. I'm sorry, Mr. Austin.
The castle's upstairs area has been renamed from '*Stonecold Fortress, Upstairs*' to '*Longwinter Upstairs*'.
  
* You can now see up to the top of the stairwell tower. Cobwebs were added to the top.
There is now a railing on the balcony at the top of the stairwell. The balcony floor has been slightly adjusted.
  
* Various hay bales were moved around to stop them from clipping into walls.
Korir's bed is no longer stuffed with hay and hay does not clip through the headboard.
  
* The statue of Ysgramor in Korir's bedroom has been replaced by a more relevant statue of Mara.
The stairwell now uses Windhelm textures for stairs and platforms, instead of Castle Volkihar textures.
  
* The firepits and platforms in Korir's bedroom now use Windhelm textures instead of Farmhouse textures.
The large platforms in the great hall now use Windhelm textures instead of Sovngarde textures.
  
* The pedestals used for trophy bases now use Windhelm textures instead of Whiterun textures.
Various stairs inside and outside the keep now use Windhelm textures instead of High Hrothgar textures.
  
* The arches/gatehouses outside the keep no longer have Ancient Nord portcullises.
Korir's bedroom no longer has Nord rubble poking through a certain section of the floor.
  
* Korir's throne no longer has another throne layered on top of it. *Thrones of Skyrim* compatible.
A wooden ladder in the great hall that apparently went nowhere has been disabled.
  
* Because hiking up to the castle takes quite a while, there is now an unlockable map marker for it.
**NEW!** Korir no longer has a staff and soul gems in his quarters. Thanks to VictorF.
  
* **NEW!** The castle now automatically has a unique map marker if you are using [Common Marker Addon Project](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56123)﻿.

  
This mod obviously requires Cities of the North - Winterhold. All credit to JPSteel2 for the excellent base mod. I hope you'll all enjoy these customizations!
