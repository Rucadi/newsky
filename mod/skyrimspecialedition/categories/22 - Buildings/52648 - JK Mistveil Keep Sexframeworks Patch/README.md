This is a small patch to fix the location of bed and chair inside JK Mistveil Keep at Wylandriah's Enchantments room.
  
It basically made so that JK Mistveil (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52462) and Sexsceneframeworks (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40183?tab=description) can work together.
  
  
  
Also, you may want to download JK's Interiors Patch Collection (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35910) if you have many other mods that may conflict with other mods.
  
  
  
Thanks to Janquel for helping me identify the issue
