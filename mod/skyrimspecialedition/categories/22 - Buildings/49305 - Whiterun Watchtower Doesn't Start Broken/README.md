Very simple mini-mod. Does exactly what the description says:
  
  

  
* **Undamaged Tower**: Before "Dragon Rising" (Quest where you and Irileth defeat your first dragon and you learn "Fus"), the tower is undamaged.
**Damaged Tower**: When the attack begins, the tower will revert back to vanilla. (Burning for a while, non burning broken tower after)
  

  
The change happens automatically, nothing for you to do. No issues at all with the main quest, completely independent from it.
  
  
Regarding the design: I'm not an expert decorator and the new fort is not perfect. It's not a beautiful redesign or a huge change to the place. This is just a small mod to prevent the immersion-breaking realization that the tower has always been broken before the attack.

FAQ:
  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  
  
**Does this mod make changes to any vanilla script?**No, no changes. Those files are untouched completely, so compatible with anything that might change the main quest too.
  
  
**What is the script for?**
  
When you are near the doors of whiterun (from the outside), the most simple script in the world asks the game if Dragon Rising has started/been completed. If this is the case, the tower reverts back to vanilla. Otherwise, nothing happens.
  
  
**Is the new tower navmeshed?**I respected the original navmesh of vanilla, so it works for both states of the tower. This means guards should patrol without colliding with stuff when walking around: but if something attacks the tower like a wolf or bandit, they might have a brief moment of something blocking their way. Everything reverts to vanilla during and after the attack anyway, so it shouldn't be a big deal.
  
  
In order for the navmesh to work both in the broken and unbroken state of the tower, I had to be somewhat creative, so the layout of the fort shows a bit of an already somewhat old/broken tower, but it's well defended with spikes and patrols, so the tower still looks like it serves its purpose: Making sure no threats to Whiterun come from the western road.
  
  
**Can I install this midgame?**Yes, but if you've already completed Dragon Rising, the tower will be unbroken until you visit the entrance of Whiterun, since that's when my mini-script asks the game for the state of the quest.
  
  
**How does the tower look in the distance?**From the distance, the LOD will look like the broken tower. Not sure how dyndolod works or if it will affect this mod. The good thing is: the layout of the broken and unbroken tower is very similar, so it shouldn't be too noticeable.
  
  
**I found a bug!**
  
Feel free to reach out if you encounter a bug, mod is quite light so besides the mini-fort not looking amazing, there shouldn't be any issues.
