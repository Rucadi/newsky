**The aim of this mod is to make Skyrim's most legendary and infamous artifacts more powerful without making them
  
over-powered, to make their effects unique and invaluable, and to stay within the Elder Scrolls lore.
  
  
This mod has been made to improve immersion. When I come across a legendary artifact that's boring or under-powered, I find it completely breaks immersion. Auriel's Bow, for example: created by a god with craftsmanship that's said to have no equal, but it's less effective than a Glass Bow and its enchantment is mediocre. The weapon of a god shouldn't be so mundane.**
  
  
**Updated Artifacts**
  
Includes balanced, lore-friendly and immersive improvements
  
to over 50 of Skyrim's most legendary and famous artifacts,
  
and removes item leveling.
  
  
**Modular Installation**
  
A Vortex installer and Merging Guide let you to choose
  
which artifacts are improved and which are left alone.
  
  
**Alternatives**
  
Optional new textures and equipment-types
  
available for some artifacts.
  
  
**V1.7 Now Available!**
  
Bug fixes and improved stability.
  
New improvements for some artifacts.
  
New method for acquiring alternatives and Thane weapons.
  
For a general overview, see **V1.7 Update: general overview** in the Q&A section.
  
For a full list of changes, see **V1.7 Update** in the Changelog section.
  
  
**Requirements and Compatibility**
  
No other mods required, fully compatible with all my mods.
  
DLC requirements listed below; Dragonborn and Dawnguard required for full install.
  
**Place this mod lower in your load-order than any other mods that might clash to avoid any issues.**

**For [color=#00ff00]V1.7 Update: general overview,
  
press the spoiler button below[/color]**
  
  
Spoiler[left]**V1.7 Update: general overview**
  
**Q) What's changed since V1.6?**
  
A) The main things to be aware of are:
  
- For SE, ESL flags have been applied to individual artifacts esp files if you do a modular install (i.e. pick-and-choose installation instead of full installation)
  
- Major fixes for the Bloodskal Blade, the Oghma Infinium, the Wabbajack, and Mzual
  
- Minor fixes and rebalancing changes across several other artifacts
  
- The Nightingale equipment, Ring of Namira and Skull of Corruption have been remade to be closer to their lore descriptions
  
- The Amulet of Articulation (formerly renamed the Gloomwatcher Amulet) is now the Amulet of Intimidation, with a new effect
  
- The White Phial update has been removed from the mod
  
- A new, smoother means of aquiring weapon alternatives has been added (see **Alternatives** section for more info)
  
- The "ZIA\_Complete Pack.esp" file is now installed even for modular installation (see **Merging Guide** section for more info)
  
- Removed the Thane Trade system; thane weapons are automatically added to your inventory on installation if you are a thane of their respective holds
  
- Brought back the tentacle for Miraak's Sword (removing it is now optional during installation)
  
For a full list of changes, see the **Changelog** section
  
  
**Q) Do I need to start a new game to use this mod?**
  
A) No. Even if you already have an artifact in your possession, it will still work when this mod is installed. Be sure to unequip and re-equip any armor and/or jewelry. If you have thane weapons installed, they will be added to your inventory on installation if you are a thane of their respective holds.
  
  
**Q) Can I update from a previous version (e.g. V1.6) without starting a new game?**
  
A) Not recommended. Updating from a previous version may work for some (in testing it always works for me), but there's always a possibility that it will cause bugs, especially if you're running a lot of mods.
  
  
If you are determined to install mid-playthrough, I recommend the following steps:
  
- Unequip any armor pieces affected by this mod
  
- Dispose of any weapons you have enchanted with one of the new enchantments from the Thane pack
  
- Make sure all artifacts with an alternative available are in their vanilla states (e.g. Dawnbreaker must be one-handed rather than two-handed)
  
- Save your game, then quit Skyrim
  
- Uninstall V1.6
  
- Open Skyrim, load the save you just made, save your game again, quit Skyrim
  
- Install V1.7
  
- Load your latest save and re-equip any unequipped items. If you have the new thane weapons installed, they will be added to your inventory on installation if you are a thane of their respective holds
  
- If you previously had the Dragon Knowledge power, you'll need to re-add it with console commands. Open the console, enter 'help "Dragon Knowledge"' to get the spell's ID number, and then enter "player.addspell " follower by the ID number
  
- If you had obtained the White Phial, it should now be in the cupboard next to Neruleon's bed in the White Phial shop. If it's missing, this means the White Phial is permanently gone and can't be reobtained in a functional way, even through console commands
  
  
**Q) I preferred V1.6 of an artifact to V1.7, why the change?**
  
A) When designing these mods, I have four criteria (arranged here in priority order): 1) is it lore-friendly? 2) is it powerful without being overpowered? 3) do I like it in gameplay? 4) is it potentially buggy? If I've changed an artifact between V1.6 and V1.7, it's because it was failing on one of these criteria. Here are some justifications for some of the more controversial changes:
  
- I removed the White Phial because it was bugged and couldn't be fixed without SKSE, which I want to keep out of this mod
  
- I felt the Nightingale armor set had strayed too far from the lore, and I received feedback that it wasn't the most well-liked part of this mod. The new changes feel more in-line with the lore, and generally better
  
- Cannibalism used to increased skills with the Ring of Namira. I found in gameplay this meant you were incentivized to eat everyone, which had the effect of slowing down gameplay. It's also not a particularly lore-friendly feature, so I remade cannibalism to be more in-line with the original effect[/left]

Spoiler[left]**Common questions and requests**
  
  
**Q) What is the Tamrielic Lore Revisited book?**
  
See Bugs and debugging below
  
  
**Q) Why is "ZIA\_Complete Pack.esp" installed even if I don't choose to install everything?**
  
This mod has been restructured so that all individual modules are patches on the base "ZIA\_Complete Pack.esp" file instead of independant mod files. This has several advantages:
  
- Makes files much more maneagable for me, so I can actually find the time to make updates in the future
  
- Patches can now be made that work for modular installations, not just the full version
  
- Neater filing (all packages in a BSA rather than loose assets)
  
- Allows inclusion of a single, centralised quest to monitor quest-implemented features, including artifacts alternatives and weapon-equipping abilities, hugely helping to prevent bugs and reduce script bloat
  
- Avoids issues associated with merging larger files
  
  
**Q) Can you recreate module files as ESLs?**
  
A) For SE: ESL flags have been applied to individual artifact .ESP files as of V1.7.1. Note: "ZIA\_Complete Pack.esp", the only ESP without an ESL flag, is installed whether you do a full or pick-and-choose install. Also note: all ESPs are still mergable using the **Merging Guide** below, but for ESL-flagged ESPs this probably isn't necessary.
  
  
**Q) Can you create a version with unlimited charges?**
  
A) No, this is not lore friendly and is therefore not in keeping with this mod's ethos.
  
  
**Q) Can you make the artifacts disenchantable?**
  
A) No. Many of the new enchantments are unique and wouldn't work as generic magic effects. More than that, though, the lore requires these items to be non-disenchantable, and I'm sticking to the lore in this mod.
  
  
**Q) Can you update some Anniversary Edition artifacts?**
  
A) I might do. It's a lot of work, but I'm thinking I might do this eventually.
  
  
**Q) Can you update another artifact?**
  
A) No, I've looked at all the artifacts in Skyrim and only amended the ones I feel need updating. I don't want to spend forever updating things that don't require updating from a lore perspective.
  
  
**Q) Can you make a patch for X mod?**
  
A) No, I won't be making any patches for this mod as I don't have time. The mod has good compatibility so I don't think a patch is even necessary for most playthroughs, so I simply don't want to dedicate all my time to creating patches for this. Sorry!
  
  
**Q) Can you create a two-handed version of Dawnbreaker that includes a sheathe?**
  
A) No, it's physically impossible to draw a sword from your back if its sheathed and the sword is longer than your arm. Sheathed greatswords are unrealistic and not something I want to spend any time implementing in ZIA. Sorry!
  
  
**Q) Can you create more alternatives? Maybe a one-handed Rueful Axe, for example?**
  
A) After a lot of requests and a lot of work, I found a way to make Volendrung and the Ebony Blade one-handed. I haven't done the Rueful Axe because changing it causes issues with the associated quest. Furthermore, I really don't want to spend any more time trying to find a workaround for this. Therefore, I won't be adding any more alternatives.
  
  
**Q) Why hasn't the Aetherial Crown / Harkon's Sword / the Jagged Crown etc. been updated?**
  
A) I've focused on artifacts the lore says should be more powerful. Other artifacts are either unmentioned in the lore, or they match their lore descriptions.[/left]

press the spoiler button below[/color]**
  
  
Spoiler[left]**Compatibility questions**
  
  
**Q) Is this mod compatible with USLEEP and Morrowloot**
  
Yes, BUT, not all the changes implemented by USLEEP and Morrowloot are implemented in ZIA. I recommend placing ZIA lower in your load order than USLEEP and Morrowloot to avoid these mods causing any changes to the artifacts you want improved by ZIA.
  
  
**Q) Is this mod compatible with Unique Uniques?**
  
Yes.
  
  
**Q) Is this mod compatible with X mod?**
  
A) I can't test this mod against everything, so I won't always know. Overall, this mod has good compatibility. It doesn't require SKSE or any other mods. It will run with Unique Uniques, Ordinator and Morrowloot (though you should place it after Morrowloot in your load order).
  
  
Generally, any mods that only change the mesh or textures of the artifacts will be compatible (except for those affecting the Gauldur Amulet). Compatible examples which I use include:
  
- Spellbreaker Reborn
  
- Capeless Nightingale
  
- Improved closefaced helmets
  
  
If a mod edits .esp files (for example, if it changes stats or enchantments), then generally it won't be compatible. However, you can usually still have both mods installed, though only the mod lowest in your load order will appear to work.
  
  
**Q) I'm running another Cannibalism overhaul, will this be compatible with the Ring of Namira?**
  
A) Depends on how that other Cannibalism overhaul works. I'd suggest you test it yourself...might be they're compatible, might be they're not.[/left]
  
  
**For [color=#f1c232]debugging questions,
  
press the spoiler button below[/color]**
  
  
Spoiler[left]**Debugging questions**
  
  
**Q) The Bloodskal Blade isn't firing
  
OR The Staff of Magnus isn't recharging my magicka
  
OR I can't reforge Wuuthrad at the Skyforge
  
OR I'm not receiving Thane weapons
  
OR I don't get the option for artifact alternatives**
  
A) If you have any of these issues, read the book Tamrielic Lore Revisited. This will reset the underlying scripts these processes rely on, and should fix the issue. This book can only be acquired using console commands (i.e. use 'help "tamrielic lore revisited"' to find the form ID, followed by 'player.additem <formID>')
  
  
**Q) I'm not receiving the Thane weapon of Whiterun**
  
A) This is a vanilla bug not caused by this mod. To avoid it, after you kill Mirmulnir, don't fast travel anywhere until after you have heard the Greybeards summon you from High Hrothgar (usually happens on the way back to Whiterun).
  
  
**Q) The Ebony Blade isn't being powered-up when I kill friendly targets, why not?**
  
A) The vanilla system for this is fairly buggy. ZIA taps into that system, and so in rare cases this might be bugged for you too. I have found that sometimes a kill is just ignored by the Ebony Blade (even if a previous save is loaded), so just because it doesn't work once doesn't mean it won't work if you try again with a different target. I've also reduced the number of required friendly kills, which should help alleviate the problem.
  
  
**Q) All my thane weapons are now named Thane Status, why is this?**
  
A) The vanilla thane weapons are not unique items and therefore can't be replaced in the traditional way. As such, all old versions of the thane weapons will be named Thane Status and must be traded for the new versions by you in-game. See the Thane Weapons section above for information on how to do this.
  
  
**Q) An artifact is invisible/purple/blue or not working properly, what's the problem?**
  
A) A fairly common issue with mods like this is that scripts or textures aren't properly unpacked when installing. I suggest re-installing and checking your data folder if you have any issues.
  
  
**Q) An artifact still has its vanilla enchantment, what's the problem?**
  
A) Open the console and search for the artifact with the help command, e.g. "help voledrung". You should see a list of form IDs, including a file marked TEMPLATE, e.g. "WEAP: (1024CA6F) 'TEMPLATE - Volendrung'. If you don't see this, it means you haven't installed this artifact. If you do see this, add the template to your inventory, e.g. "player.additem 1024CA6F 1". Open your inventory and look at the template artifact. If it has the correct enchantment (i.e. the mod version), this means another mod is overriding ZIA, so ZIA should be moved down in your load order. If it has the vanilla enchantment, you may edited something by mistake, so you'll need to reinstall with a clean save.
  
  
**Q) Why doesn't Chillrend have a sheathe even if I install the reshaped version?**
  
A) For some reason, the Special Edition version of the reshaped Chillrend doesn't display the sheathe. I've no idea why and didn't want to delay releasing this mod by delving into it. If you discover what the issue is, do let me know!
  
  
**Q) When I have Miraak's mask equipped my conjuration spells don't always work, why is this?**
  
A) This is an unfortunate side-effect of spell-absorption, and there's no way around it. Basically, when you cast a conjuration spell, you have a 30% chance to absorb the magicka from that spell instead of feeling the effect, just like hostile spells.[/left]

The artifact improvements applied by this mod are divided into Packs.

**Absorbs 25 points of health. Foes will flee when first struck for 3 seconds.\***

**The Bloodskal Blade**
  
**Inflicts 30 points of magical damage. Power attacks release energy blasts that deal 50 points of damage.\***
  
- Enchantment capacity: 3000/16 = 187 uses (or, for energy blasts, 3000/24 = 125 uses)

- Quicksilver alternatives now available (see the Alternatives section)
  
  
**The Gauldur Amulet**
  
**Your skills are 10% more effective and increase 10% faster.\***
  
- Requires Dawnguard and Dragonborn
  
- A new unique texture for the Amulet and its fragments (see the Alternatives section)
  
- The fragments have the same enchantment but are specific to Combat, Magic and Stealth skills
  
- Fixed the bugs preventing some races from equipping the Amulet
  
- Fixed the equipping errors that stop the Amulet and its fragments becoming visible at high body weights
  
- Fixed the bug that prevents the Gauldur Amulet from adjusting its shape to the size of the wearer's body (this proved impossible for the fragments, but they have been improved slightly)
  
- Added the ClothingNecklace keyword to amulet and fragments
  
- Weight of amulet set to 1.5; fragments set to 0.5
  
- Names of the fragments have been updated to “Mikrul's Amulet Fragment”, “Sidgis's Amulet Fragment”, and “Jyrik's Amulet Fragment”
  
- Value increased to 8,990 (fragments are now 2,800, 3,050 and 2,950)
  
- Manakin's now display the amulet
  
  
\*Note: the 10% effectiveness boost is similar to the first perk of each tree (e.g. the first perk of the One-Handed tree improves one-handed weapon damage; similarly, the Gauldur Amulet increases one-handed weapon damage). The only exception is the magic skills which have both increased magnitude and decreased cost.

- Sounds updated in line with USLEEP
  
  
Note: I haven't included a tempering recipe for Keening as I don't believe it should have one.
  
However, USLEEP does add a tempering recipe, so with USLEEP installed you'll be able to temper Keening with a dwarven ingot.
  
  
**Kyne's Token**
  
**Doubles damage inflicted against animals. Increases your stamina by 50 points.**
  
- Adds the ClothingNecklace keyword

- Black Star value increased to 11,900

- Value increased to 13,590
  
- A two-handed version of Dawnbreaker is available (see the Alternatives section)
  
  
\*The first time an undead target is struck, it receives an additional 20 points of fire damage and is staggered (35% chance of heavy stagger, 5% chance of knock down).
  
Special thanks to LeanWolf for the two-handed Dawnbreaker mesh
  
  
**The Ebony Blade**
  
**Absorbs 25 points of health. Strengthened by the blood of deceit.\***
  
- Enchantment capacity: 5000/82 = 60 uses

- Reduced number of required friend-kills to fully power from 10 to 5
  
- Now benefits from Two-handed perks and skills only
  
- Weight increased to 14
  
- Can now be tempered to Legendary with the Daedric Smithing perk (requires Ebony ingot)

- Sounds have not been updated in line with USLEEP as I believe the vanilla sounds work better
  
- A one-handed version of the Ebony Blade is available (see the Alternatives section)
  
  
\*Killing a friend or ally will grant you the Blood of Deceit, which doubles the enchantment's power for one real-time hour (equivalent to just under a day in Skyrim)
  
\*\*Powering up the Ebony Blade by killing allies now increases its physical damage, not its enchantment power. This means when you first receive the Ebony Blade, its damage will be lower.

Some artifacts have new options for textures, meshes
  
or in-game appearances, and equipment-types.
  
  
To obtain these alternatives, you will either have to make changes in-game
  
or implement changes during the mod installation process.
  
  
Spoiler[left]**[size=5]Alternatives: textures**
  
When installing the mod, you will have the option to install alternative textures for some artifacts.

**Alternatives: conversions**
  
When you first receive some artifacts (see list below), you will be prompted to choose their equipment type (e.g. choose between Light Armor and Heavy Armor). If you ever want to change your choice, simply drop the artifact and then pick it up again in one of the following locations:
  
- Dragonsreach
  
- Kilkreath Ruins
  
- Knifepoint Ridge
  
- Largashbur
  
- Haemar's Shame
  
- Shrine of Peryite
  
  
The following artifacts have alternative equipment types:
  
- Ebony Blade (One- or Two-handed)
  
- Dawnbreaker (One- or Two-handed)
  
- Volendrung (One- or Two-handed)
  
- Ebony Mail (Heavy or Light Armor)
  
- Spellbreaker (Heavy or Light Armor)
  
- Masque of Clavicus Vile (Heavy or Light Armor)
  
  
WARNING: If uninstalling this mod, artifacts you've switched for alternative equipment types must be restored to their vanilla types or they will be lost.
  
  
  
**Alternatives: crafting and non-optional**
  
These alternatives require no special effort from the user; they are either craftable through regular means, or are in-built into the mod (i.e. not optional).
  
  
**Masque of Clavicus Vile: Pelted**
  
You can attach (and remove) a bear pelt to the Masque of Clavicus Vile at any tanning rack. There are three different colors: brown (from bear pelts), dark (from cave bear pelts) and white (from snow bear pelts). This is a purely aesthetic change and does not affect armor type, armor rating or warmth.
  
  
**Wuuthrad: one-handed**
  
You can convert Wuuthrad into a one-handed version. You'll first need to complete the Companions quest line and speak to Eorlund Grey-Mane, who will tell you the Skyforge now feels more "awake". Then, activate the Skyforge with Wuuthrad in your inventory, and you'll have the option to reforge it.
  
  
**The Gauldur Amulet**
  
This mod includes a new texture for the Gauldur Amulet. Because the mesh and texture for this amulet is not specific to this one artifact (Kyne's Token and the Saarthal Amulet have the same appearance), and because edits are required to the mesh files themselves, I have had to implement the new texture through the .esp file. Therefore, this texture update is not optional, unlike the other alternative textures provided.
  
  
[Click here to see the Gauldur Amulet's new texture.](https://i.ibb.co/wYf30BN/Gauldur-Amulet.jpg)[/left][/size]

Depending on how you choose to install this mod's content, you can have between 1 and 35 individual esp files
  
installed. Most of these are ESL flagged in Skyrim SE, but for anyone looking to reduce their esp count, all
  
esp files in Zim's Immersive Artifacts (ZIA) are designed to be easily merged into a single esp file.
  
  
**For a guide on merging ZIA's esp files,
  
press the spoiler button below**
  
  
Spoiler[left]**Step 1: Requirements**
  
You will need to have the following installed (links in brackets):
  
(i) TES5Edit OR SSEEdit (http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/25859/? OR https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/164)
  
(ii) The Merge Plugins Script for TES5Edit/SSEEdit, see the installation tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFsHhRBilfY (note: the tutorial is for TES5Edit, but it works for SSEEdit too)
  
(iii) A mod manager (e.g. Vortex)
  
(iv) Be aware that all the .esp files provided in this mod have short names because merging several files with long names can cause issues; please see a list below which details the contents of each .esp file.

ZAU - Auriel's Shield

**Step 2: Merging your .esp files**
  
1) Install the mod with your mod manager (e.g. Vortex)
  
2) Open TES5Edit/SSEEdit. You'll see a list of all the .esp files in your Skyrim Data folder, which will include all the .esp files of Zim's Immersive Artifacts (ZIA) installed with your mod manager. Make sure only these files are ticked, and click "OK" to load them. Wait for the files to load.
  
3) Once the loader has finished, right click any of the loaded .esp files and select "Apply Script". You will then be given a list of scripts to choose from; from this list, select "Merge plugins v1.9" (or whatever the most up-to-date version is). Click "OK".
  
4) You'll be prompted to select the .esp files you want included in this final merged mod...make sure "ZIA\_Complete Pack.esp" and any indivual modules you want merged into it are ticked, and click "OK". If it's your first time using this script, you may be asked to customize some settings...I suggest sticking with the default options unless you know what you're doing!
  
5) Click "OK" again to create a new file, and give it a name "My\_ZIA". Once the merge is complete, the new file should appear bolded in your list of .esp files
  
6) Close TES5Edit/SSEEdit. You should be prompted to save your changes to the new file, make sure it is ticked before clicking "OK".
  
7) Go to your Skyrim data folder (most likely installed in a location like this: "Program Files\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition\Data"). Delete "ZIA\_Complete Pack.esp" (note: do not delete "ZIA\_Complete Pack.bsa" or "ZIA\_Complete Pack.bsa - Textures") and any individual modules you have installed (e.g. "ZIA\_Daedric Pack.esp", or "ZAB.esp"). Find your newly merged file (which you should have named something like "My\_ZIA) and rename it "ZIA\_Complete Pack". This will ensure assets from "ZIA\_Complete Pack.bsa" can be loaded by your new .esp file.
  
8) At this point, your install is complete. If you have any problems, post a comment and please specify you're having issues with merging your files. Please also note: if you decided to uninstall ZIA, your merged file will be lost, so you may need to repeat this process (or better yet, save a copy of your new "ZIA\_Complete Pack.esp" file).[/left]

the **V1.7 Update: general overview** section in the Q&A.
  
  
**V1.7.4 update notes:**Spoiler[left]**V1.7.4 update**
  
- Fixed meta-data labeling
  
- Fixed bug in the SE version causing Thane weapons to be installed even if user chose not to install them
  
Note: after introducing a bug in V1.7.2 (thane weapons installing even if not chosen in the fomod) and further errors in V1.7.3 (mod labelled incorrectly, thane weapons bug not properly fixed for SE version), I've setup a checklist for myself when updating this mod. This will ensure I don't make silly mistakes when updating, as I have in the last two updates. V1.7.4 has been thoroughly checked and should be error-free. My sincere apologies to anyone who found these updates confusing and/or annoying! If you're currently running V1.7.2 pr V1.7.3, you can safely update to V1.7.4 without the need for a clean save.[/left]**V1.7.3 update notes:**

- For SE, Removed warmth from Savior's Hide (as I discovered this could cause issues when merging)
  
- For SE, fixed the broken Daedric Pack
  
- For SE, individual artifact ESP files now fave ESL flags[/left]**V1.7 update notes:**
  
Spoiler[left]**V1.7 update**
  
The main aim of this update was to fix bugs and improve the stability of the mod, as I had reports it would sometimes fail on longer games. As part of this, I completely restructured it, moving most changes into a central ESP file that the modules patch onto to implement their changes. This has several advantages:
  
- Makes files much more maneagable for me, so I can actually find the time to make updates in the future
  
- Most patches that previously would only work with the complete install will now work for modular installs too
  
- Neater filing (all packages in a BSA rather than loose assets)
  
- Allows inclusion of a single, centralised quest to monitor quest-implemented features, including artifacts alternatives and weapon-equipping abilities, hugely helping to prevent bugs and reduce script bloat
  
- Avoids issues associated with merging larger files
  
  
The result is a much more stable mod. As a failsafe, I've also added a book named Tamrielic Lore Revisited, which will reset some underlying quests when read and can be used to fix some bugs in case of a late-game fail.
  
  
I also wanted to make the process of acquring Thane weapons and alternatives smoother and easier to use, and thus replaced the old switching and Thane Trade systems. I feel the latest method fits into Skyrim quite seamlessly.
  
  
Finally, in terms of the actual artifacts themselves, there have been several changes to balancing and both major and minor bug fixes. There are major fixes for the Bloodskal Blade, the Oghma Infinium, the Wabbajack, and Mzual. The Nightingale equipment, Ring of Namira and Skull of Corruption, and Amulet of Articulation have all been remade. I removed the White Phial completely as this was bugged and could only be fixed with SKSE, which I don't want to include in this mod.

However, there's some variations that can occur under certain conditions (i.e. one of your highest skills is over 92 and therefore can't receive the full 8-point increase, or you have more than five joint-highest skills).

Spoiler[left]**V1.4 update**
  
The main aim of this update was to incorporate appropriate changes from USLEEP and Morrowloot (MLU) into ZIA. There are no instances where the artifacts I've amended are identical to USLEEP and MLU; rather, I've used USLEEP and MLU as a basis for adding things like proper sound effects and keywords to the artifacts in ZIA.
  
  
Additionally, this update has included extensive tweaks to improve balance, bug fixes, changes to effects in some cases (where previous effects were bugged, underwhelming or too far from game lore), and even the implementation of new textures and equipment types for some artifacts. I have also created a formula for determining the values of the various artifacts so that their values are consistent (therefore almost all artifacts have had their values changed).
  
  
I've also included the Bloodskal Blade, Chillrend and Kyne's Token, as well as a new pack including Miraak's equipment in this update.

Spoiler[left]**V1.3.1 update**
  
Although no changes have been made to the content of the mods since V1.3, there are changes to take note of:
  
- The SE version has now been properly ported across to SE (i.e. all individual .esp files have been loaded in the SE Creation Kit and re-saved). This means V1.3.1 is error-free according to SSEEdit
  
- Restructured the fomod loader, which has allowed the file size to be much smaller allowing for easier downloading[/left]**V1.3 update notes:**
  
Spoiler[left]**V1.3 update**
  
Two small bug fixes:
  
- Added the Elven material to Auriel's Shield, allowing it to be tempered to Legendary with the Elven Smithing perk
  
- Fixed a bug that caused the ward effect of Spellbreaker to permanently remain in place when the shield was switched out while blocking[/left]**V1.2 update notes:**
  
Spoiler[left]**V1.2 update**
  
The big change is the addition of Auriel's Shield, but other minor changes have been made as well:
  
- Fixed the bug that causes absorb visuals when you have the Atronach Stone power and are standing next to someone with Dawnbreaker
  
- Fixed the blocky hit visuals on the Ebony Mail
  
- Fixed the error on the Staff of Magnus mod
  
- Fixed the error on the Sanguine Rose mod
  
- Removed the Alteration effect type from the Rueful Axe to prevent bugs with its enchantment[/left]**V1.1 update notes:**
  
Spoiler[left]**V1.1 update**
  
The most obvious change is the introduction of the Installer, which allows for easier selection of the mods you want to choose. Changes to content include the following:
  
- Thu'um Fahdon's Drain Voice effect now lasts longer but is capped at 80%
  
- Black Whisper's invisibility spell has been reduced to 8 seconds (to improve balance)
  
- The Marshborn Bite and the Furious Icefist have been given new names from the Nordic language (the original names were leftovers from previous versions of the weapons that, in hindsight, weren't well suited)
  
  
- Ebony Mail has been returned to a Heavy Armor piece, BUT, there is now an option to acquire a Light Armor version (see mod description)
  
- Sanguine Rose's enchantment cost lowered from 2000 to 1500
  
  
- Auriel's Bow has been given a faster speed (at the cost of range) to ensure it has the most powerful damage:speed ratio for a bow in the game
  
- The visual effects of the Gauldur Amulet have been removed (these were too invasive to gameplay; the effect is unchanged, but it will now run quietly in the background without being noticed)
  
- Completely remade the Staff of Magnus since the previous version was over-powered in some ways and under-powered in others (as a side note, I noticed a vanilla mistake with this Staff...it says you can absorb health, but the vanilla effect damages health. It doesn't absorb health at all! This has been fixed in this update, so if you were previously using this and wondering why the health absorption seemed slow or bugged, try it now, you should see the difference immediately)[/left]
