When it comes to the Elder Scrolls series, I love the artifacts. I'm a full on treasure hunter, willing to go out my way to hunt and gather all
  
these ancient and priceless relics. For power, for fame and fortune, to
  
hold a piece of history within the world.
  
  
Many of these artifacts have become key components to specific character builds with
  
some being included within every kind of play-through. Yet while some
  
are better than others, sometimes these great artifacts pale in
  
comparison to their original counterparts, if not they are complete
  
garbage, a disappointment, or would eventually become power crept by
  
self-made enchantments.
  
  
It just saddens me when I see an artifact of legend gets overshadowed by a Wooden Sword with Chaos Damage
  
enchanted on it. So I wanted to fix that, and through trial and error,
  
looking through the lore and relics of the Elder Scrolls, I finally
  
managed to do just that by tweaking these powerful items just enough so
  
that they would be worth getting and be kept as balanced as possible.
  
  
Which brings us to this rather large overhaul and by the Divines it took me a
  
while, but I've learned quite a bit when it came to modding with this
  
project.
  
Hours and days I've been working on this, scouring through pages of the USEP articles on lore,
  
stats, and enchantments. Watching videos and tutorials on how to do this and that with these and those.
  
And learned a few things on certain pieces of content in the Creation Club.
  
Yet despite all that, I did it and with any hope that I still have left in
  
this shriveled up husk I call a body, I've succeeded in fulfilling my
  
task.
  
With that said, lets get on with the changes already!
