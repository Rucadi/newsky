Trapped in Coldharbour the Alessian Empire festers. Throughout Vigilant's depiction of Coldharbour you'll find the souls of many [ancient Imperials](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Nede) ﻿that would have lived during Saint Alessia's empire in the 1st era. Now those Imperials can be depicted with armor that fits the context well. This patch distributes armor from [Ancient Imperial Armor SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/142655) into the armies of the Alessian Empire from [Vigilant SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11849). This does not include Vigilant's many boss enemies; only generic enemies are affected.
