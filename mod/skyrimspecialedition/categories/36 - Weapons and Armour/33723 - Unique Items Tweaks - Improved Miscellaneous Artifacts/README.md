# Unique Items Tweaks - Improved Miscellaneous Artifacts

There are a lot of fantastic artifact overhaul mod like [Reliquary of Myth - Artifact Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31612) (Fresh, balanced and interesting, go check out this one), [Zim's Immersive Artifacts](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9138), etc. But some items are often overlooked or ignored. Yes those items probably won't be your end game equipment but in vanilla they are outclassed by pretty much anything by the time you acquired them, especially in modded playthrough.
  
  
I create this mod with a goal to complement [Reliquary of Myth - Artifact Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31612)﻿ and make those untouched (or not yet visited! ) items a little better. Once the author of that mod touch the following items, I will happily remove them from my mod since I am sure it will be much more interesting than mine.
  
  
The philosophy I adopted here is pretty simple, I tweaked numbers and stats, added a few vanilla effects. That's it. Most of these items had pretty decent effects in vanilla game, just lacking in stat numbers make them useless. No more! Now let's see if you like the changes.
  
  
***[size=3]It is compatible with [USSEP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266) and [WACCF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18994). [size=2]Yet WACCF is not required.*** [/size]

*Strongly recommend not to bash patch this plugin because it reverts many changes this mod made.*

Okin now has the same attack speed with Eduj so no longer feel odd when dual wielding.

50% chance for each attribute to absorb 25 points of Health, Stamina and/or Magicka. **Fires 30% faster than a standard dwarven bow.***A cool unique bow but underpowered by the time you acquire it. So I increase its damage and let it shoots faster just like the Zephyr since they both have the dwarven look.* 
  
  
Glass Bow of the Stag Prince
  
Wielder receives an increasingly powerful blessing for every 20 animals killed by the bow. 25 points of extra damage to Animals.
  
Initially, the blessing grants an additional 5->10 points of health and stamina while the bow is equipped. This figure increases to 10->20 for
  
 20 animals killed, 15->40 for 40 animals killed, up until 80 kills where the blessing maxes out at 25->80.
  
*IMO this bow was underpowered in vanilla. So I increase the blessing to match the number of animals you killed with the bow. Also added the animal bonus damge because it is the blessing of the hunt from Hircine.*
