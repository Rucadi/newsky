*This mod started as a Scimitar redesign as well as a way to finish some old stuff that I never released.
  
But, I did end up making a whole new set of armor on the side lol.*Overview:This mod adds 4 kitbashed light armor sets and 1 heavy set, as well as a few weapons.
  
Also, a summonable undead giant and craftable Jar bombs.
  
  
**1.6 - Bado Gedhay Armor***-Craftable w/ Advanced armors.*
  
*-Find the Puppetman Spell Tome in Embershard Mine*The Bado Gedhay are a brotherhood of monks, founded in Hammerfell as a response to the violence which once swept through the country. Now they travel from place to place, determined to protect the weak and vulnerable from the ravages of war.**![](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/150208/150208-1764889605-28822731.png)﻿**![](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/150208/150208-1747368548-1561022590.png)﻿
  
Crafting:
  
The sets are all crafteable aside from the Askia set which is found on a miniboss(Nchuand-Zel Entrance).
  
The weapons are all crafteable as well, aside from the shotel(Dropped by Kematu),
  
The N'Toussain Nimcha(In Broken Oar Grotto),
  
And the Brass Graveaxe(Icewater Jetty)
  
  
Jar Bombs can be crafted at the forge in sets of 12, working like craftalbe Scrolls.
  
  
The Corsair set is a set of fortified robes, a little stronger than scaled armor.
  
  
The Mahayi set is an armor of plate/maille based and is a little stronger than gilded elven armor.
  
It is based on bits of central asian armor(Krug).
  
  
The Ra-Gada Heavy set comes in four variations which are about as strong as Ebony Armor.
  
The variations take their names from various pieces of african armor,
  
which I've envisioned as different Hammerfell clans.
