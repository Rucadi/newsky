*"Yet the wicked and foolish are not doomed, for in their infinite mercies, the Nine have said, Repent,
  
and do Good Works, and the Fountains of Grace shall once more spill forth upon you."*
  
  
This mods adds a full set of armor and weapons inspired by Oblivion's DLC Nights of the Nine but with a completely new look based on ESO's breton armor concept art. It includes the complete armor with two helmets to choose from and a ring; the sword Chrysamere; the mace Light of Day; and a warhammer called Skullcrusher. 5 new shrines have been added to the game with new models and appropiate blessings (Pelinal Whitestrake, Magnus, Phynaster, Y'ffre and Sheor).
  
  
Everything is obtained through a lore-friendly quest started by praying at any shrine of the Bretony Pantheon (All but Talos) and following the commands of The Divines from there. All the weapons can be obtained in two-handed or one-handed versions. The armor in heavy or light armor (based on highest skill) and is compatible with all races, genders and body weights. All items are balanced to fit in the game as late-game equipment and can be tempered with the Ebony Smithing perk. They all include custom unique enchantments with new functionalities such as bouncing enemy spells back, having access to new spells and much more.
  
  
The armor set includes a degree of customization with two texture variants one can choose from in a new workbench. Additionally, once the items have been obtained one can also craft unenchanted versions of them and customize these as well.
  
  
 The quest has been playtested extensively by me, but if you encounter any bug do tell and I'll fix it. In the artistic department, all models and textures were carefully crafted from scratch and are delivered in 4k or 2k resolutions, any feedback you can provide is appreciated.
  
  
Due to a bug in Dawnguard DLC, [Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266/) is highly recommended if using the mentioned DLC, otherwise vampires will be pacified by Woodland Grace effect as if they were animals.
