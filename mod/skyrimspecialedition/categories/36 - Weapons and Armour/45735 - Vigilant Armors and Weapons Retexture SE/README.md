**Introduction**
  
  
[font=Arial]The idea for this mod started after I played Vicn's Vigilant quest mod for the first time. It quickly became my favorite quest mod. I loved all of it, especially the last act. My only issue with this mod, was that some of the armor and weapon textures seemed a bit low-resolution and some of the colors looked a bit off to me. Since I've had a lot more free time lately, I decided I would try to retexture most of Vigilant's armor and weapons. This mod is just a personal project of mine, but since I haven't seen any mod on the nexus that retextures all of Vigilant's armors and weapons in one, I decided I would upload it here. I'm open to any suggestions, as long as it is constructive![/font]
  
  
  
  
[font=Arial]**Version 4.0**[/font] Version 4.0 is almost a brand new mod. Besides 2-3 sets, I redid everything from scratch. Vigilant's latest update (1.7) added many new armors and weapons and it also brought new higher resolution meshes and textures. I set out to retexture the new items, but quickly realized that my older retextures didn't look so good anymore. For this reason, I decided to ready them all (or almost all of them). I also deleted all .nif files besides the Laza of order helmet (to add the read "hair/feather") and the slave hunter coat to fix a bug where the wrists disappear if you wear gloves. Removing all the nif files means you will not need a patch for CBBE, HIMBO, 3BA, etc. If you were using the old CCBE patch, you can uninstall it. 
  
  
  
  
  
  
**[font=Trebuchet MS]Installation[/font]**
  
  
Simply choose your version and install. Load after Vigilant SE and the HI-res pack (if you use it)
  
  
Hi res: mix of 4k and 2k textures, for higher-end pc
  
Medium res: mix of 2k and 1k textures, for your average pc
  
Low res: Mix of 1k and 512 textures, for lower end pc
  
**[font=Trebuchet MS]Compatibility[/font]**[font=Arial]
  
[/font]
  
This mod Does not modify Vigilant's BSA and/or ESM/ESP, it is simply loose files, so it is safe to use with any version of Vigilant but was made to work with version 1.7+
  
  
Version 4.0 removed almost all mesh changes, so there is no need for a patch if you use bodyslides (CBBE, 3BA, HIMBO, etc.)
  
  
  
**Conclusion**
  
  
Thank you for giving this mod a chance! If you haven't tried Vigilant yet, I highly recommend it! Special thanks to Vicn for creating this amazing mod, to Aelarr for the amazing English voice Add-on and to everyone on the Owl Archives server for the constant support!  If you anyone has suggestions or requests, feel free to do so!
