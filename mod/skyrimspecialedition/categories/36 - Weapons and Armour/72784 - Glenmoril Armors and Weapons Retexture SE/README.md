**Glenmoril Armors and Weapons Retexture SE**
  
**About**
  
  
This mod retextures most armors and weapons from the popular mod "Glenmoril" by Vicn. I mostly tried to stay true to the original designs as much as possible.

This mod contains some mesh files. They are mostly used to change some shader settings. If you overwrite them, some armor sets will not look exactly as intended, but will still work. The only armor that would require a patch is the Anequina set, as the new meshes change its texture paths.
  
  
**Conclusion**
  
  
Thank you for giving this mod a chance! If you haven't tried Glenmoril yet, I highly recommend it! Special thanks to Vicn for creating this amazing mod and to Aelarr for the amazing English translation!  A huge shoutout to everyone from the Owl's Archive discord, I couldn't have done this without your support!
  
  
  
If you liked my mod, please remember to Endorse and also Endorse Glenmoril SE if you haven't already!
  
  
  
What's next?
  
  

  
1. Vigilant is about to be updated to version 1.7, which will change most of the armors included in the mod. Once the update is out, I will start working on a new retexture for it.
Immersive armor retexture (maybe)
  
2. Moon and Star Armor retexture (maybe)
