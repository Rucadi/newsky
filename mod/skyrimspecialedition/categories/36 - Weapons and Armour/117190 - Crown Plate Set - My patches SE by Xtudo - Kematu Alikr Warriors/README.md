**CROWN PLATE**

**My patches by Xtudo**

**Description**
  
**My patches for this amazing mod.****My Fixes and Tweaks**
  

  
* Full beast races support added. Helmets and Gauntlets.
"Warm" keyword for the Survival Mode added.
  
* Proper blood decals added to the sword.
Improved collisions of ground items.
  
* Several minor clipping fixed.
ESPFE that works with any Skyrim version. It's fine to install/update mid-game, you won't loose any already crafted item.
  
* Fully compatible with refit mods, like Himbo, SOSAM, etc.
**Optional Non-HDT version.** Standalone, all fixes/tweaks already included.
  
* **Optional 2K and 1K optimized textures.**
