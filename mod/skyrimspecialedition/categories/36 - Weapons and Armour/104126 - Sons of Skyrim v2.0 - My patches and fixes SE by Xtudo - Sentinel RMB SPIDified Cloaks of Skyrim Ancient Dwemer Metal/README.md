MY PATCHES AND FIXES BY XTUDO
  
INTENDED FOR SOS V2.0.2**

**Description**
  
**My patches and fixes for the amazing Sons of Skyrim v2.0.2 mod.**[Version for Sons of Skyrim v1.5.0 here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86018).
  
  
**Fixes v1**(Requires the **Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch** installed first)
  

  
* Intended for the original **SoS v2.0.2 Main Archive SE** file.
Carried on the last Unofficial Skyrim patch fixes.
  
* Now amulets will be concealed.
Added the Survival "warm" keyword to almost all items.
  
* Edited, fixed and tweaked 98 armor records.
Changed to "Initially Disabled" 16 previously deleted records, to avoid CTD. 
  
* Several fixes/tweaks to 51 NPC records.
New loading screens models.
  
* 1st Person clipping fix for 3 armors.
Fixed the Fine Nord War Axe speed.
  
* Fixed a typo in the Stormcloak Light Shields.
ESL.
  

  
**Optional downloads** (Only textures/meshes. It's safe to install/uninstall them at any time)
  

  
* **Desaturated textures.** I manually edited all the diffuse textures to better fit my game/ENB. Maybe you like it too. 4K-2K-1K versions available (4K it's the same size than the original Optional HD Textures file).
**Cloaks of Skyrim patch**. It will replace 21 linen cloaks. It doesn't touch the capes, nor the fur cloaks. **HDT-SMP version available**. Requires **Sons of Skyrim - HDT Physics for Cloaks Patch﻿**installed first. Many thanks to **Naru1305** for the HDT meshes used as base for this patch.
  
* **RMB SPCH - Cloaks of Skyrim HDT-SMP patch.** It will replace 21 linen cloaks. It doesn't touch the capes, nor the fur cloaks. Requires Sons of Skyrim - HDT Physics for Cloaks Patch﻿ installed first. The default **NON-HDT****Cloaks of Skyrim patch** is already compatible with RMB SPCH.
**Loading Screens patch.**This will actualize the loading screens with the new models. Already included in the Main Fixes file, but I added this file if for some reason you don't want to use it.
  
* **Sentinel - An Equipment Overhaul.** Standalone. Use it instead the Main Fixes file. Desaturated Textures or similar are compatible with it.
**Legacy of the Dragonborn patch**. The new armors and shields will be displayed now. Load it before mods like Lux. ESL.
  
* **Legacy of the Dragonborn - Beirand patch.** In this version [Beirand](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Beirand)﻿ from Solitude will sell all the related armor items. Ideal if you can't find some items and to use up Museum coin donations. Load it before mods like Lux. ESL.
**Legacy of the Dragonborn - SENTINEL - Beirand patch**. [Beirand](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Beirand)﻿ from Solitude will sell all the related armor items. **If you're getting some invisible items, or purple textures, you'll need to install the Sons of Skyrim's assets, only Mesh and Textures folders are required, don't install the NW\_Sons\_of\_Skyrim.esp plugin**. Load it before mods like Lux. ESL.
  
* **Shield on Back patch**. Only meshes. It adjust 13 shields to avoid clipping with the capes. To avoid the "flying" shield when equipped I edited/adjusted their grip too. It's not perfect but it will do.
**Ancient Dwemer Metal patch**. Default and Desaturated 4K-2K versions available.
  
* **Markarth Steel Armors and Weapons patch**. 4K-2K Default and Desaturated versions available.
**Fixes - RMB SPIDified - Sons of Skyrim version.** Fully compatible with RMB SPIDified, which now supports my **Combined Armors** patches too.
  
* **Combined Armors - Markarth.** It will combine the SoS v1.5 and v2.0 armors. There are two light and two heavy versions now. All have the same chances to be used. Recipes included.
**Combined Armors - Winterhold.** It will combine the SoS v1.5 and v2.0 armors. Adds the v1.5.0 heavy armor version. All have the same chances to be used. Recipes included.
  
* **Combined Armors - Stormcloak Officer**. It will combine the SoS v1.5 and v2.0 armors. Adds 3 v1.5.0 SC Officer armors, Default, with Fur and with Cape. All have the same chances to be used. Recipes included.
**Combined Armors - Falkreath.** It will combine the SoS v1.5 and v2.0 armors. Adds the v1.5.0 light armor, helmet and shield. All have the same chances to be used. Recipes included.
  
* **Markarth Golden Armors and Weapons patch**.
**Smaller Shields patch**. All shields reduced to almost Vanilla size. Default and Shield on Back versions available. Combined Armor shields included. Only meshes, so it's fine to install/switch/uninstall mid-game.
  
* **Somewhere in Between - 3BA Armor compilation replacer**. Desaturated textures for the Guard Armors and Ancient Dwemer Metal patch.
**Elysium Estate patch.** The new helmets and shields will be displayed now. Load it before mods like Lux. ESL.
  
* **Elysium Estate - Beirand patch.**In this version [Beirand](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Beirand)﻿ from Solitude will sell all the related armor items. Ideal if you can't find some items. Load it before mods like Lux. ESL. There's no need to install this Beirand version if you already have the LOTD - Beirand patch installed.
**Ground Items - Adjusted Shape patch.** It adjust the shape of the ground items to vanilla size, with proper collision grid. Combined Armors already included, there's no problem if you don't use them. Only meshes. It's fine to install/uninstall mid-game. Set it last of all.
