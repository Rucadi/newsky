**> REQUIRES [THE CAUSE CC](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Cause)(ccbgssse067-daedinv.esm)

  
Description**
  

  
* Requested by a friend over at Discord so I decided to make this simple mod.
This mod allows you to wear the armor worn by the Ayleid Wight enemies found in [Rielle](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Rielle)﻿. 
  
* The armor set is equivalent to Light Elven Armor (the second cuirass is equivalent to regular non-gilded Elven Armor).
The armor can be crafted once you finished [The Cause](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Cause_(quest))﻿ and requires **Elven Smithing** perk.
  
* In-game, the armor set is called "**Tattered Ayleid Cuirass/Gauntlets/Helmet/Boots**".

  
**Misc. Info**

  
* Plugin is ESL-flagged ESP.
An optional ESL-flagged ESP is provided for those who want to loot the armor off the Wight themselves. Feel free to merge this with the main Mod. 
  
* ALTERNATIVELY, you can skip the optional ESP for a SPID INI. **Installing both will cause the Wight to drop 2 sets of armor**.
Armor is wearable with both **VANILLA MALE AND FEMALE** bodies.
  
* Bodyslide files are provided for HIMBO and CBBE users under **Miscellaneous** tab. Look for "**Ayleid Wight**" suffix.
This mod contains no textures; as it will use the textures included in the CC for the Wight. Any textures affecting the Wight will affect the armor as well. 
  
* ~~Will do Norion Robes if someone wants to make the physics.~~
