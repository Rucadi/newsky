# Aetherial Artifacts Rework

• This is a rework of the Aetherial Artifacts. Have you ever felt disappointed with the original three artifacts? Disappointed with the reward after all the trouble? While other mods have changed them, none have truly satisfied me, so I decided to redo them myself. Now, they are no longer mere collectibles away but powerful tools of combat.(Does not include modifications to the model's appearance, they are other mods)
  
  
**（This mod is ESL marked, no need to take up precious ESP slot）**
  
  
**Adjustments:**
  
• The Aetherial Artifacts are now significantly more powerful; however, this power does not come without a cost. A new consumable has been introduced as the price of this power.**Aetherial Energy Stone**
  
• As a price and balance for using them,This consumable is not cheap. It requires filled soul stones and Lots of Dwarven metal ingots to make. Even a filled black Soul Gem can only make 12 energy stones at a time,When you obtain any Aetherial artifact, equipping it will allow you to create energy stones (energy stones are essentially miscellaneous items, not soul gems, and cannot be used to recharge).

• **Aetherial Staff**:• The original staff was undoubtedly the second weakest among the artifacts. I have reworked it differently, introducing more schools of magic and transformation.

• **Aetherial Staff - Summon:**
  
• In the Base Game, the staff's effect was to summon a Dwarven Sphere, Spider, or even some scrap metal, based on your level. Frankly, I appreciated this mechanism; it looked like the staff was teleporting an unlucky Dwemer construct from somewhere to fight for the player. However, as a combat tool, it wasn't practical. Imagine encountering an enemy, using the staff, summoning scrap metal, and getting yourself killed—frustrating, isn't it?
  
  
• My rework,Consumes <1> Aetherial Energy Stone to randomly summon one of <4> void-forged Dwemer automatons to fight for you for <120> seconds. They take <50%> less damage, deal <25%> less damage, and can deal void damage. Their level increases with you.<Ability to use Aetherial Conversion to change the staff school>

**• None of the Aetherial Staff effects are influenced or enhanced by skill tree perks.****• Aetherial Shield:**•The worst choice. I seem to have never chosen it in all the time I have played the game. The effect is meaningless.

• My rework, Bash attacks deal <15> points of Aetherial damage over <3> seconds. While blocking, an Aetherial Ward is formed, absorbing <100> points of magic damage, granting <100> armor rating,ncreases elemental and magic resistance by <10%>.

• **Reflected spells :** Consume energy stones to reflect incoming spells. Most spells can be reflected, even those cast on yourself, but one energy stone is consumed every 5 reflections, so it can also be switched on or off through Power so it can be turned on when dealing with mage enemies.

**• Aetherial Crown**:• In the Base Game, this was most people's choice (including mine). The ability to have multiple Standing Stones remained a very tempting feature, one of the few strong effects in the Base Game.
