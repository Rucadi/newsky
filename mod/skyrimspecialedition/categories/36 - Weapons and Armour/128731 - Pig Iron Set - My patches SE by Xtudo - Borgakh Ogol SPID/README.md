**PIG IRON SET**

**My patches by Xtudo**

**Description**
  
**My patches for this amazing mod.**
  

  
* Minor UV fixes on helmets and armor arms.
Fixed clipping between armor and helmet.
  
* Full beast race support for the helmet.
Changed footstep sound from light to heavy armor.
  
* Improved collisions of ground items.
Changed the required temper Quicksilver Ingots to Orichalcum Ingots.
  
* Changed MaterialShieldLight to MaterialShieldHeavy on the shield.
Improved a bit all pieces stats and values.
  
* Added blood decals to the mace.
Added new two-handed maul.
  
* Added a 30% bigger shield, the Pig Iron Targe Shield.
Added "Warm" keyword for the Survival Mode.
  
* Moved a bit the shield position to avoid clipping with the forearm.
ESL plugin that will work with any Skyrim version. It will replace "PigIronSet.esl". It's fine to install/update mid-game, you won't loose any already crafted item.
  

  
**Optional files**

  
* **Optional 2K and 1K optimized textures** (The original are 4K). Don't install them with Orichalcum textures. Requires one of the Main files installed first.
**Orichalcum Color Palette patch.** 4K, 2K and 1K options available (Optional Textures already included). Requires one of the Main files installed first.
  
* **Non-HDT version**. All fixes already included. It will replace "PigIronSet.esl". It's fine to switch versions mid-game.
**Borgakh the Steel Heart and Ogol SPID patch.** It will give the armor to the two vanilla heavy armor orc followers. Requires one of the Main files installed first.
  
* **Gularzob - Pig Iron Maul patch.** Carried on Gularzob USSEP fixes. Requires one of the Main files installed first.
**Vanilla Orcish Armor replacer.** Carried on USSEP fixes. Full beast races support. New ground items that perfectly fit the original ones, to avoid clipping or wrong positioning, also 100% compatible with LOTD display. Requires one of the Main files installed first, but activating PigIronSet.esl is optional. 
  
* **Adjusted Mace Grip patch**. The grip is lower now, improving the reach of the mace. Requires one of the Main files installed first.
