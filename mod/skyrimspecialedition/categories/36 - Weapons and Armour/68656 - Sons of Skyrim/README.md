[font=Times New Roman]Description:
  
  
 ﻿This mod adds new armor and equipment for stormcloaks and city guards. When creating the armor, I tried to adhere to the Nordic style, based on realistic examples and added certain fantasy elements.
  
 ﻿Stormcloaks received a set of light and heavy armor, which are randomly distributed among soldiers. This means that the stormcloak soldiers are volunteers, so they buy their own equipment - whoever has enough money for what. For identification, insurgents are distinguished by blue armbands or belts.
  
 ﻿The Windhelm Guards are singled out - they have standardized light and heavy chain mail armor and on top of it a blue vest with iron plates sewn inside. The Guard is armed with swords and axes, as well as heavy and light shields.
  
Officers and nobles of Windhelm received a more expensive and modernized version of the armor of the guards, which is a logical continuation of the last one.
  
 ﻿Dawnstar Guardsmen wear armor with a pale white quilted jacket. The armor is made of iron mined in local mines. On the torso of the armor is a round plate with a four-pointed star. Almost every guard wears a cloak or fur cape. The main weapons are a ship's ax and a heavy shield.
  
 ﻿The Guard of Winterhold is going through bad times, now that almost nothing is left of their city - the number of guards is only a few people. But their armor still looks good, probably from the days when Winterhold was the capital. The guards are armed with stout axes and old heavy shields.
  
 ﻿The Morthal Guard wear light leather breastplates over a warm quilted jacket. Since the settlement of Morthal is not rich and does not have its own mines or forges, only some guards can afford to wear chain mail under the breastplate by adding separate metal elements. Armed with simple axes and light shields.
  
 ﻿The Falkreath Guards are clad in fine leather armor that is reinforced with iron plates beneath a leather base. The reason for this is a large number of hunting grounds, and accordingly a large number of leather materials. In addition, the leather material is impregnated with a special oil to protect the armor from frequent rains and high humidity. The guards are armed mainly with axes and light shields.
  
 ﻿Since the city of Riften is not poor, its guards are also well armed. The Guard has its own stylized armor made of steel plates that are fixed on top of a leather base. A purple quilted jacket is worn under the armor. They also have characteristic high-top helmets with a tuft of horse hair on the brim. Guardsmen are armed mainly with swords and heavy drop-shaped shields.
  
 ﻿The Nords, who settled on the site of the ancient Dwemer fortress - Markart, actively use the advantages of Dwemer metal. Using the profits from the silver mines, the Nords hired Orc smiths to forge very good Dwemerite armor for the Markarth Guards. The guards are armed with Dwemerite swords and shields.
  
 ﻿Whiterun is a rich trading land with the best riders in all of Skyrim. The city guard is the largest in number and at the same time uses good armor made of steel scales. The personal guard of the Jarl stands out, having the best scaly armor of riders decorated with gold and corundum. The guards are armed with swords and axes, as well as light and heavy shields.
  
 ﻿Solitude is the capital of Skyrim, so the city guard has the best steel armor, which is stylized according to the old Norse-imperial style. Under the armor, the guards wear a red quilted jacket. And armed with swords and heavy shields.

Update 2.0.0
  
  
 ﻿As a result of my rethinking, the version 2.0 modification received some changes and rearrangements. You can see the changes in the new screenshots, and you can also read the revision in the description. In general, there were many changes, so I will not mention everything, but it is important to note, that I created a brand new ESP file. I tried to make the mod less conflicting with other mods. So I gave up on the replacement idea and now all mod items are added separately. I also didn't edit the named NPCs to avoid conflicts with appearance mods. I also haven't edited the level lists (almost). But it was still necessary to edit the standard records of outfits and records of nameless characters of guards and soldiers. Unfortunately, you can only downgrade to 2.0 by starting a new game, otherwise the guards from the game will be partially naked and this will have to be fixed via the "resetinventory" console command.
  
 ﻿A separate version of the ESP is added, where all modification items will be available only in the forge, you will not see them anywhere else.
  
Made a separate version that only gives armor for stormcloaks and other armors are available in the forge.
  
 ﻿In the full version of the modification, the ability to forge all things in the forge is added, and why not, if you are a talented blacksmith, then you can make any copy of the equipment.
  
 ﻿Also added standard NPS replicas to all Stormcloak armor options.

[font=Times New Roman]

  
* Installation of the modification is carried out in the standard way - to unpack Main Archive in the folder with the game.
Additionally, you can download HD textures and unpack them into the game folder.
  
* The ESP modification file must be placed in the launcher as low as possible in the list, so that other modifications do not overwrite the data.
This modification will conflict with global modifications that change the records of stormcloak soldiers and city guards.
