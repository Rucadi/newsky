I enjoy hunting in Skyrim and making use of the land, so this is a mod I made to expand on it some. I originally made a bow, a sword and a dagger, then kept adding more and more to it. For the weapons, there is an early version and a late game version (ebony smithing) to keep you using these weapons during your whole playthrough. ALL WEAPONS AND SHIELDS CAN BE CRAFTED AT TANNING RACK. Type "Hunter's" to filter
  
  
UPDATE 1.1 ADDS "A Crafting Guide for Hunter's Gear" to reveal recipes. Have 1 copy or more in inventory to show. Costs 1 leather.
  
  
 Below are some of the weapons:
  
  
4 Variations of Feather Bows, and then 4 late game versions of those bows as well as Early and Late game Arrows.
  
4 vatiations of Feather Crossbows and then 4 late game versions of these as well as bolts early and late game.
  
Dagger early and late game.
  
Sword early and late game
  
Greatsword early and late game.
  
Several clubs and great clubs Early and Late.
  
Some maces and battleaxe type weapons Early and Late.
  
  
45 shields based on animal heads from wolves, horkers, sabre cats, bears and even a mudcrab shield.
  
Highly recommend [Immersive Equipment Displays](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62001)﻿. To show shield on back or to scale the shield sizes if they are too large.
  
  
ESL so it won't take up the esp slots. Replaced vanilla animal textures will show, unless it replaces meshes as well.
  
  
No world edits, but Hunters will sell animal heads and death items of animals have heads added. In case you use Hunterborn and it won't let you get the heads, the hunters are a good backup. However, they will not sell Dragon heads. Doesn't make sense and some people don't like playing dragonborn.
  
Heads sell below 60 gold for wolves and horkers.
  
Heads sell for 100 for Bears and Sabre Cats (Vale Sabre didn't have mounted head so it's Sabrecat with Vale textures)
  
Dragon Skull sells for 700. Can be turned into Scale or Bone at Grain Mill. (Used as late game Club)
  
  
Enjoy!
