[font=Trebuchet MS][size=5]-- DESCRIPTION --

[/font]
  
This mod comprises of three armor and/or matching weapon sets.
  
  
My first armor mod from Oldrim [Apotheus Light Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/19501/), well, my first that's mostly made from scratch. I've long deleted my real first which was just a retexture of mashed up pieces from the game. All I did for this one was port its Oldrim assets, as I find it difficult to go back on old projects. Being My first, it has many flaws in my eyes, having learned better modeling techniques. If I had to work on it again I'd have to throw away most of the 3d assets to start all over, and I don't have the time for that right now. I really only included this for the base lore I established.
  
  
*Apotheus armor is actually a part of hothtrooper44's [Immersive Armors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3479), so in the file section there are 2 choices for the main file, one includes the Apotheus Armor (Incompatible with Immersive Armors) and one that does not (Compatible with Immersive Armors). Choose only one.*
  
  
My second Oldrim armor mod the [Blooded Heavy Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/44636) that I created to match the [Targe of the Blooded](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Targe_of_the_Blooded) shield already found in-game. I reworked the blooded armor meshes and textures a bit after learning more on proper/practical and historical armors from youtubers like Knyght Errant, Skallagrim and Shadiversity. This was where I initially planned for my 2nd run with modding to stop... But having myself opened to a more enlightened perspective on the subject, I found myself with a new drive to create another custom armor that is more grounded in history.
  
  
Enter my latest design, highly inspired by Scandinavian and 13th century knight armors, the **Duskward Light Armor** follows/continues the lore I established for the Apotheus Light armor that circles around the unfortunate and late [Ulag](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ulag).
  
  
Spoiler
  
Having not played Skyrim (Oldrim) for almost 3 years, I've created this for my new playthrough with SSE, mainly because I love being able to personalize my character completely, as I roleplay to experience the great new quest mods and unofficial expansions by the Beyond Skyrim team. I've actually had this brewing in my head since SSE came out and I came up with this concept art early 2017:

[size=3]Obviously a lot of design changes have been made translating my design into a 3d model since I had to work around
  
Skyrim's anatomy/proportions and my limited modeling skills.
  
  
[size=4][size=3][size=4][size=3]My idea for this, being a light armor, that it will be something you can put on and strap in easily without any aid like most full plate armors.[/size] As before I tried to design an armor that looks like it will easily fit the world and theme of TES V, that is practical, not too tacky and actually viable to be worn and move around in if it was ever made in real life.[/size][/size]

[color=#f6b26b][size=6]--  WHERE TO FIND AND HOW TO CRAFT --

[/size][/color][/font]
  
*Each armor set has a corresponding journal that needs to be in your character's Inventory for that set to appear in the list of craftable items when using forges or the Skyforge. But don't worry, I made it so that the journals can't be sold to merchants. So you can either always keep them in your inventory or store them in a safe, non-respawning container you can remember. This also serves to avoid flooding the list of items in the crafting menu, as you most likely have many other mods that add new craftable items.*
  
  
**APOTHEUS LIGHT ARMOR**
  
[/size]

  
* In a Knapsack beside the dead body of **Ulag** found in the [Sleeping Tree Camp/Cave](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Sleeping_Tree_Camp)﻿ along with its corresponding notes on how to craft it, **Ulag's Journal.**
Only craftable at the [Skyforge](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Skyforge)﻿.

**BLOODED HEAVY ARMOR**
  

  
* Worn by [Umana](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Umana)﻿, a redguard woman found in the last chamber inside [Alftand](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Alftand) cathedral.
Also in the last area where Umana and Sulla Trebatius can be found fighting and location of the hidden stairs to Blackreach, in front of a chest by the center is **Ulag's notes for Umana**, which is needed to craft the set. *(In case you've already killed Umana before this mod and her body has been cleaned, you can still find the notes in order to craft them)*
  
* Enchanted set *(with "the" prefix before blooded, e.g. The Blooded Boots, The Blooded Gloves, etc.)* Only craftable at the Skyforge.
Unenchanted set *(no prefix before blooded, e.g. Blooded Cuirass, Blooded Helm, etc.)* craftable at any forge.
  
* the Targe of the Blooded can also be improved at the Skyforge.

**DUSKWARD LIGHT ARMOR**
  
[/size]

  
* Worn by a dead NPC, **Villtr the Unsung**, that I placed in the once empty cage at the last chamber/room of [Pinemoon Cave](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Pinemoon_Cave)﻿. With his own accounts of his life, **Villtr's Journal** in his inventory, which is needed to craft the set.
Enchanted set *(With possessive apostrophe "s" e.g. Duskward's Boots, Duskward's Gloves, etc.)* Only craftable at the Skyforge.
  
* Unenchanted set *(no possessive apostrophe "s", e.g. Duskward Armor, Duskward Helmet, etc.)* craftable at any forge.
Dark version of both Enchanted and Unenchanted set also craftable at either the Skyforge or any forge respectively.

[size=3]*One form of balancing I made is the need for three (3) rare ingredients due to the lore I created for the process of crafting these sets. Which are [Fire Salts](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Fire_Salts) and [Frost Salts](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Frost_Salts) for almost any piece with Steel parts and the [Sleeping Tree Sap](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Sleeping_Tree_Sap) for almost any piece with organic based parts (leather or wood).*
