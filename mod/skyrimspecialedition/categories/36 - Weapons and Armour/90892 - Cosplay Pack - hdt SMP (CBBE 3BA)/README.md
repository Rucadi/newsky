**NOTICE**
  
  
1.4 Update is live!
  
  
This update focuses on the Bunnyclub pack
  
  
Featuring:
  
  
- Velvet/sheen and clear coat material, two of the principle PBR materials that I forced into Skyrim.  
  
  
- New rework heel slider for already high heel shoes. I made these shoes and stockings with 60% heel CBBE feet as a template so if you wear them with other people's stocking mod that use 100% heel as a shape, it won't fit. Now with rework heel slider, using it at 40% will match the 100% CBBE shoes shape.
  
  
- String version for bikinis. By string, I mean the version where vertex loops along the bikini string are dissolved. This results in bikini string becoming perfectly straight no matter the pose or preset (not recommend for flat cast character).
  
  
- Config file for [Dynamic Armor Variants](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65963)﻿ to cycle between regular version and NSFW version immersively with a hotkey
  
  
- Other new textures and fixes outline in documentation.

This has been my personal off-time project for over a year now. After ungodly amount of time spent on remaking the whole thing from ground up, I'm happy to call it finished. 
  
  
Introducing **Caenarvon's Cosplay Pack** (~~CCP~~), a collection of female clothing made 100% with love in the style of classic cosplay trope. The aim not to make a new and unique design, but to do justice to a true classics.
  
Traditional, iconic and well-made.
  
  
Made especially for mashup, mix-and-matching, consider this the Lego of female clothing.
  
  
The Cosplay Pack contains the following:
  
  
**Cosplay Pack Ghosted**
  
salvaged from my unsuccessful Halloween pack. Bikini and Latex theme
  
  
**Cosplay Pack Schooldays**
  
Sailor and Blazer uniform theme
  
 
  
**Cosplay Pack Sportdays**
  
Contest and sportwear theme
  
  
**Cosplay Pack Bunnyclub**
  
Bunny and Showgirl theme
  
  
**Cosplay Pack Underwear**
  
Additional underwear for other pack
  
  
**Cosplay Pack Maid**
  
Best maid (there's doc marten in this)
  
  
This mod is meant for experienced users and not entirely plug and play. If you have no idea what 3BA or SMP or bodyslides are then please search up about the topics and go through some tutorials before using this mod.
  
  
For users of my old cosplay pack, those versions are so obsolete, **delete them completely** and download this mod instead. This is the final version.
  
  
Support only [CBBE 3BA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30174) (v2.4 or above)
  
  
2K native texture.
  
  
Download as All-in-One or as separate mods in optional tab.

Warning: this mod features multiple SMP heavy parts.
  
**Result may varied on lower end PC**Featuring over 460 pieces of clothing (unique models, and texture variations)
  
  
The Cosplay Pack is made for mix and match, slots for each clothing are generally assigned as:
  
  
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/825695407924314142/1105046970235637821/slot.jpg)
  
With few exceptions for technical reason ﻿
  
  
You can open and use bodyslide while in game and make changes to your clothing model without having to relaunch the game
  
  
As such, I highly encourage you to explore bodyslide and custom sliders I made individually for some of these clothes. I know there are tons to look at individually and it is easier to just batch build and forget about it, but for perfection sake, do try these custom sliders.
  
  
For example
  
  
All socks and stocking are made for high heel by default but you want to wear it without high heel. Hop on bodyslide and find NoHeel slider
  
  
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/825695407924314142/1105049164628373514/image.png)
  
﻿![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/825695407924314142/1105049893552279612/image.png)﻿
  
  
Build and reequip in game. Now you have stocking that fit bare feet.
  
  
Or
  
  
Hat is too low and clipped into your hair. Worry not, hop on bodyslide again
  
  
![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/825695407924314142/1105051086571700304/image.png)
  
  
Build and reequip in game, keep adjusting until you find the fit.
  
  
There are also many zap sliders, pressed slider (for squishy effect), compatibility sliders and more to explore.
  
  
Try out and find your favorite piece then look at its bodyslide to see what kind of custom sliders it has!
  
  
﻿All SMP cloth physics clothes also come with non SMP version. You may prefer some pieces with SMP version and other with non SMP version, try them out!
  
  
Some of the top piece (slot 32) has its slot 46 version so you can wear bikini or clothing from other mod under.
  
  
For true perfectionist, I recommend making a user's correction slider (pdf guide in download)
  
  
Note\*
  
  
I experimented with ENB complex material on swimsuit texture which allows me to imitate a sophisticate wetness texture. For best visual, I recommend using the latest ENB functions. 
  
  
  
Weapons
  
  
If cosplay waifu isn't your thing, I present you the cosplay weapon packs.

Q: *How is this even lore-friendly?*
  
A: :GigachadYES:
  
  
Q: *No, it's not.*
  
A: Yes, it is.
  
  
Q: *I am using your other mods and mod manager is giving a conflict warning when installing this mod, what?*
  
A: Ignore it, its just a few reused cubemaps.
  
  
Q: *Skirt stretch down on the ground, broken physics broken mod xdd*.
  
A: You did not install SMP correctly. Follow the instruction on SMP mod page *closely*.
  
  
Q: *I did a supercool anime summersault strike and dress got stuck in body parts, help!*
  
A: reequip to reset physics, also try doing anime summersault irl while wearing a dress and see *how it goes*.
  
  
Q: *I enter new cell and SMP is all messed up.*
  
A: Some cell entrance is so far away from world origin where you actually spawn in and the game has to move you through long distance instantly to the door you are entering the cell from. Getting warp to the entry is what mess SMP up. It is simply a game design thing, not much I can do.
  
  
In fact, if SMP behaves weirdly, reequipping or use SMP reset console is your best bet
  
I highly recommend this mod
  
[Clean Up the Physics Outfit - Collision Reset](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86845)﻿
  
for immersive way to reset SMP
  
  
Q: *Does this mod work on AE?*
  
A: Yes
  
  
Q: *Why it does not look like by character's body type?*
  
A: Build in bodyslide with your preset
  
  
Q: *Costume clip a little bit, help?*
  
A: As much as I tried to, it won't be prefect for all slider combinations. On user's side, you can fix a minor clipping by opening the outfit in Outfit Studio and use inflate tool to repair the clipped area.
  
  
Q: *What is this naming grammar. English, mf! do you speak it?*
  
A: Bugs me too. But for the sake of inventory sorting optimization, this will have to do. 
  
  
Q: *Quality is not consistent.*
  
A: I built this over time as my skill progress. Newer one is obviously better than the older.
  
  
Q: *I don't like weeb NSFW stuff, why am I seeing this?*
  
A: Why are you even here?
