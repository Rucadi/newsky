V1.3 Added 1K Version
  
  
This mod adds five standalone heavy armors, 2 weapons, boss fights & a new spell to Skyrim, worthy of many builds. ESL version Included. All textures are 4K.
  
  
There is a LOT to grab in this mod which will be listed at the bottom alongside some questions and answers.
  
  
SPOILER BELOW FOR THE MAIN STORY
  
  
Spoiler 
  
  
You can find 4 of the 5 armors (along with the first weapon) at Skuldafn Ruins. 4 'NPCs will be guarding the portal to Sovengarde from, a statue in shows the area they will be. Each Vessel is using one of the magical elements, while the final one is a 1h swordsman. The NPCs carry the items. Kill one and they will burn up and offer you a Dragon soul.
  
  
The final armor and weapon set can be found within Sovengarde itself, at the hill which Alduin sits on. This Vessel is a master at using Shouts and can push you off the hill if you're not careful.
  
  
The spell, Word Eater's Hunger can be used from the powers menu whenever you have Alduin's Devoted Sword equipped. With it, you'll put your weapon into the ground, creating a shockwave that'll throw your enemies back, and frenzy some of a certain level.
  
  
It is recommended you play through the main story as to not break any quests. (If you've already beaten the story use Console Commands to teleport there)
  
  
 
  
  
The battles will be hard fought, bring potions, poisons, arrows, atronachs and be sure to fully take advantage of your Shouts! 
  
  
Alternatively you can use Additem Menu/Console Commands to obtain the gear. (I suggest this method if you do not want to risk ruining your save if you haven't done the main story)
  
  
Vanilla weight slider is supported. Armor works on females but uses the same meshes.

Questions and Answers
  
  
Q: Can I request an armor pack?
  
A: Yes you can! There are not guarantees I can do it though as I am busy a lot of the time.
  
  
Q: What if you don't want to do my request?
  
A: There's a chance that if I don't want to do it, it's because the model either is behind a paywall, or it uses a file format I cannot open.
  
  
Q: How powerful is the gear?
  
A: The light armor is all equal to Dragonscale, the heavy armor is higher than Dragonscale, the Akatosh Sword is equal to Dragonbone and the Alduin Sword is higher than Dragonbone. The spell has infinite uses.
  
  
Q: Can I get beast support?
  
A: There already is ;)
  
  
Q: Can you make the armors replace \*insert armor\*?
  
A: No.
  
  
Q: Hey, the armor kinda looks like Emperor Zurg! Don't you thi-
  
A: ***No.***
