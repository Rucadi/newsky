fleet knight is a modular, female only heavy armor & weapon set themed after a wayrest marine knight with functional but unobtrusive plate and a cool wetsuit type thing
  
  
my aesthetic targets a stylized dimorphic look but without compromising on practicality(much) or the cool factor
  
  
the set features a full underarmor you can wear on its own as a casual style, with a few more variant items where applicable, like less armored or torn versions of main items. if you don't like helmets, the mask is tagged as a helmet!!

item legend:
  
B = variant rig
  
D = damaged variant - **is nsfw**
  
S = revealing variant - **is nsfw**
  
  
bodyslide info:
  
**plz don't touch body zaps since they're required to cull unused parts of the body**
  
  
when building, please note **bodyslide and os renders items with transparency even if it's turned off in the nif, so the top and tights having holes is a graphical glitch.** ingame only the D variants will have holes. press t to turn off textures to view real mesh clipping in the preview window
  
  
**if you experience any clipping there are sliders that can help that have clip in their name -**try typing in numbers past 100 until you no longer see clipping
  
  
gameplay info and location:
  
items have steel stats and main slot items (body, hands, head, feet, weapon) can be tempered. items are not craftable but found near the entrance to [Broken Oar Grotto](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Broken_Oar_Grotto) a little past the campfire in a chest near the coastline. (check last image) there's lore inside !!
  
  
the mod is modular, but **intended only to be worn with itself:** the body slot is the core, and stuff is added onto it afterwards.the mod is technically sfw when all items are worn as pictured, but you can do evil things by equipping S/D tagged items
  
  
textures are 2k, but there's like 10 texture sets to ensure all uvs are occupying a good portion of their resolution. i'd do 4k but my pc can't handle creating it :<
  
  
the mod is an esl and i think i did it properly, but this is my first sse mod so please tell me if its munted!!
  
  
this is my first scratch-made mod made using Blender & Substance 3D Painter with lots more to come in a similar knighty vein, if you're interested;
