**Description**
  

  
* A set of light armor for the members of the **Phantom Thieves**. Rumors has it that their main headquarters are in Hew's Bane, but no one know for sure. Some say they are remnants of the elusive Outlaw Refugees who seeks to overthrow the weakening Skyrim's Thieves Guild.

  

  
* The mod comes in body armor, gloves, boots, hood, and mask (count as circlet).
Note that the mask is one-size fits all. I've made unique meshes for Argonians, Khajiits, Elves, Orcs, and Human races, however, since I have no idea how to integrate Racemenu's face sliders into the armor (or if that is even possible to begin with), you may notice some clipping or eye hole not aligning with the eyes. There really is nothing I can do about this.
  
* The hood fully support Beast Race heads. Some mane/facial hair/horns might clip though.

* The armor sets can be crafted in the forge if you possess the book Crafting Motif 33: Phantom Thief Style, which can be bought from Tonilia (which means you need to be in Thieves Guild and have unlocked her Fence dialogue).
The armor sets have the same stats with base Thieves Guild armor set.
  

  
* The main mod is compatible with vanilla body for those who are not using any custom body mods.
You can also craft the dagger with Iron stats. Note that you can further re-craft the dagger into Steel tier, Dwarven Tier, Elven tier, Orcish tier, and Ebony tier if you have the relevant perk requirements unlocked.
  
* Also available as an optional plugin (ESL-flagged): **Thieves Guild Replacer addon**. This added the option to convert the Thieves Guild Armor set (and the upgraded ones) you get from Tonilia into Rookie/Senior Phantom Thief Armor sets; as well as the Guildmaster Armor sets into Master Phantom Thief Armor sets. You can also convert back the Rookie Phantom Thief Armor sets into the original Thieves Guild Armor sets to hand-over to Tonilia to get the upgraded ones. The crafting recipe for this is unlocked once you have talked to Tonilia (after Taking Care of Business quest) to get your armors; and then to Delvin and Vex as well regarding their jobs (you don't have to accept their quests).
The optional plugin also make changes to the Outfit [OTFT] records of all Thieves Guild members, swapping their vanilla Thieves Guild armor with the Phantom Thief version. I tried using both SPID and SkyPatcher but couldn't get 'em to work correctly. Note that this might conflict with mods that make the same edits to their outfit records, including the one that distributes the outfit via SPID/SkyPatcher (e.g., the one from [FafnyB's Master Thief](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/141700) armor mod

* BodySlide support for CBBE (3BA/3BBB) and HIMBO as optional download in Optional Files tab. Type "**Phantom Thief**" in the search bar or pick from the Outfit Groups "**CBBE/HIMBO KSA - Phantom Thief**" to locate them in Bodyslide.
Plugin flagged as ESL with 1.71 header so you need [BEES](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441)﻿ if you're still on 1.5.97 like me.
