**RIHAD SWORDSMAN**

**My patches by Xtudo**

**Description**
  
**My patches for this amazing mod.**
  

  
* Minor clipping fixed here and there.
Full beast race support for helmets and gauntlets.
  
* Improved armor ground item.
Added clothing version.
  
* Added proper blood decals to the sword.
Added "Warm" keyword for the Survival Mode.
  
* ESL plugin that will work with any Skyrim version. It will replace "RihadSwordsmanSet.esl". It's fine to install/update mid-game, you won't loose any already crafted item.

  
**Optional files**

  
* **CBBE, UNP and HIMBO feet patches**. They will work with similar body shapes, as BHUNP, 3BA, etc. Requires one of the Main files installed first.
**Optional 2K and 1K optimized textures** (The original are 4K). Requires one of the Main files installed first.
  
* **SPID Integration patch by [AzureFailture.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/164344218)**﻿ Distributes to Redguard bandit tanks, Redguard Adventurers and Redguard Mercenaries, as well as bandit bosses of any race. Chances set to 4% so feel free to raise it in the file. Requires one of the Main files installed first.
**Non-HDT version.** Standalone. All fixes already included. It will replace "RihadSwordsmanSet.esl". It's fine to switch versions mid-game.
  

  
**Requirements**
  

  
* [Rihad Swordsman Set.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120576) 100% compatible with **v1.3**.﻿﻿
