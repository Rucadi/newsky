This mod brings back many of the classic unique weapons, armor and clothing from The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. This is a ported version of my original Skyrim mod, now it can be enjoyed in the Special Edition.
  
  
Changes from the original: Hatred's Heart and Hatred's Soul have been moved so that they're no longer outside of the borders. The Glacial Cave containing Shadowhunt has been significantly altered to not be such a boring location, also it's been moved to within the borders. New unique purse textures for each of the rings that are found in small purses to make them stand out as something special and not just another coin purse. And a few other minor changes.
  
  
See Change Log for updates.
  
  
Here is an example of the new cleaned and upscaled textures:
