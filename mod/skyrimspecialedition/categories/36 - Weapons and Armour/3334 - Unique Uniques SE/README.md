Original Mod: <http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/33292/?>   
   
   
   
This mod replaces the models and textures for the following Unique Items:
  
   
   
Aegisbane
  
Angi's Bow
  
Bloodthorn
  
Bolar's Oathblade
  
Dragonbane
  
Kahvozein's Fang
  
Pale Blade
  
Red Eagle's Bane/Fury
  
The Longhammer
  
Valdr's Lucky Dagger
  
Windshear
  
Shield of Solitude
  
   
Optional:  Scoped Angi's Bow
  
   
   
   
There are a few alternate textures available in his original file, and they work just fine in SE if you want them.  Go download it and throw him an endorsement if you want them!  The only alternate I'll be posting here is the Scoped Angi's Bow, since that one is a mesh and needs the conversion for SE.
  
   
Installation: Drop in your Data folder. BAIN compatible.  I don't use NMM, but it should work with that, too.
