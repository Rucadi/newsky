# Blue Frost Daedric set

This is the Daedric Blue Frost set. It includes all Daedric Weapons and armor. There are 2 versions available
  
  
Replacer - It overwrites the Vanilla Daedric set
  
  
Standalone - This adds a new set of Daedric Blue Frost Armor and Weapons to the game. It also comes with a Crown in case you want to see your character's face. It can be crafted with the same skill requirements as Daedric equipment. It is a little lighter and stronger than standard Daedric gear but requires an extra Ingredient.
  
  
The female armor is CBBE and comes with High Heels so you will need a mod that allows that for them to work properly. I suggest Racemenu High Heels. (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18045)
  
  
As of version 1.5, I included the meshes to support dual Sheath (such as Ecotone Dual Sheath)
  
  
Plugin is flagged as an esl so it wont take any room in your load order.
