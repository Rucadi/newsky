Overview**
  
  
[font=Arial][size=2]**[UPDATE: v1.5 is now live! -ER 5/30/20]**[/size][/font][/size][/font][/size]
  
  
[left][font=Arial][size=3]This mod adds 8 new dungeons to Skyrim, all of which are lore-friendly, seamlessly integrated into the world, and fully compatible with both *Forgotten Dungeons* (by juhaantero68) and *Hammet's Dungeon Pack* (by venjhammet). Everything has also been hand-cleaned and polished with TES5Edit for maximum compatibility. **Dragonborn and Dawnguard DLCs are required!**
  
My goal for this mod from the beginning has been to maximize immersion by emulating the quality of Bethesda's base-game dungeons. With any luck, by the time you stumble across these dungeons, they will feel just like another part of Skyrim. Dungeon locations can be discovered through exploration, Radiant Questing, or by reading new books scattered throughout Skyrim (see the ReadMe for the complete list of locations).There are 8 dungeons included in the current version (v1.5), including:[/font]

[b]Hints and Tips:**[/b][/size]
  
-Don't walk on the lava!
  
  
-Followers not following you? Try waiting an hour, or simply keep moving through the dungeon. They will catch up.
  
  
-Sometimes you will get hit with an infinite loading screen when exiting Grimroot Hollow (caused by Skyrim running out of RAM). Just reload from your last autosave in Grimroot Antechamber and you should be able to exit normally.
  
  
-Can't find Rimewake Grotto? East of Broken Oar grotto, you will find a rowboat with a sea chest, containing the book "The Saga of Urik the Red"; reading this book will add a map marker to Rimewake Grotto that you can fast-travel to.
  
  
-You might get stuck in a crevasse if you try hard enough. Type "tcl" into the console to toggle NoClip mode in order to escape. Untoggle it with the same command.
  
  
-Parts of these dungeons may cause performance issues for machines with older graphics cards. I've done what I can to improve frame rate, but I'm not going to spend a lot of time in the future messing around with optimization. That's just the way it is.
  
  
-While I take screenshots with an ENB (RealVision), I optimize visuals on Vanilla for compatibility. If something looks funny (contrast, lighting, etc.) that's probably the issue.
  
  
-Please report any bugs / glitches / other issues. I will try to deal with them when I can, which may be a while.**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
  
Known Incompatibilities:**
  
  
-"Invasion of Skyrim - GAT" (hard incompatibility)
  
-"Rigmor of Bruma" (only the Shatterstone Mine location; does not effect stability)
  
-"Additional Cave" (dungeon locations)
  
-"Arweden" (dungeon locations
