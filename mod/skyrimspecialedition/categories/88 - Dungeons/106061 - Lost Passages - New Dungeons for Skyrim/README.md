**Lost Passages - New Dungeons for Skyrim**adds 20 small to medium-sized dungeons to Skyrim. Each dungeon is Radiant-enabled, meaning they have a chance to be selected for quests like Bounty Quests, Companions Quests, Ancient Technology, "find the Moon Amulet", "fetch a book for the College", "find Lisbet's Statue of Dibella", "find Runil's Journal", House of Horrors, Shalidor's Insights, "find Hjalti's sword", etc.

Also works with mods that use components of the Radiant system like [Missives](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17576), [Extended Encounters](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44810), [Sidequests of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54245), various loot mods and even followers who assign quests like [Hoth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16137).
  
  
All dungeons have a boss with a boss chest, and some have secret areas with an additional boss. Each dungeon is navmeshed, so bring your follower(s). The more complex dungeons are roombound and portaled, so there shouldn't be any performance or lighting issues.
  
  
The dungeons and their locations are listed below for anyone who doesn't want to wait for them to show up in a quest.

SpoilerBoth Vyrdenskal and the Windhelm Catacombs have secret doors that lead to an additional boss. The Ironhold has a secret door to some additional loot. Hruksvar has a semi-secret pull-handle that opens a portcullis to a second boss. Bonecrack Run has a hidden vampire lair.

**NOTES**
  
  
You should be able to install this on an existing playthrough, just be aware that Skyrim can be unpredictably twitchy about new content introduced mid-game. For instance, some Radiant quests are generated at the start of the game, which means that Lost Passages won't be selected if you install mid-game. You can read more about that [here](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Radiant)under the **Notes**section.
  
  
If you're running an older version of Skyrim (pre-1130 from the Dec 2023 update), you'll need to install [Backported Extended ESL Support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441?tab=description)for this to work (for a VR version [check here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106712)). This should allow you to use any mods created with the Creation Kit after the Dec update. If you updated Skyrim in Dec 2023 to the current version you won't need to install this, new mods will just work "out of the box".
  
  
The second dungeon pack in this series is city-based at [Lost Passages - The Hidden City](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/117191).
  
  
  
**COMPATIBILITY**
  
  
The following mods have been tested and are compatible with **Lost Passages**:
  
  

  
* Ryn's Standing Stones
Hammet's Dungeon Pack 1
  
* Hammet's Dungeon Pack 2
Forgotten Dungeons

[Lux patch here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/113002?tab=files)
  
* [Hoth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16137) and other followers who use Radiant to assign quests﻿﻿

  
However, there are literally hundreds of mods that alter the Skyrim landscape, so there may be some overlap with certain mods. Even though I've tried to place the entrances in faraway places, the following overlap has been seen:
  
  

  
1. Rat Hill Mine overlaps with the Castle Valdmire player home cave
~~Needle Canyon overlaps with Gromm's Pass from the Goblins content from Creation Club~~ **Fixed**
  
2. ~~Candlestone Barrow overlaps with Graywinter~~ **Patch available on the [Graywinter](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/83152?tab=files) ﻿page**
