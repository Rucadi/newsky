This mod simply adds a new Dungeon to the world of Skyrim just to the west of Falkreath, near the base of the Dragon's Teeth Mountains.
  
  
  
  
This is my first published mod, and is an application to join the Skyblivion design team. Endorsements are very much appreciated, I hope you like the mod!
  
  
[size=3]Dragon's Teeth Prison is and old Imperial Legion prison complex that was utilised during the Great War with the Aldmeri Dominion prior to the events of Skyrim. The prison itself was garrisoned by a small cohort of Imperial Legionaries who were charged with watching over their Aldmeri captives, however the fate of both parties was never never document by Imperial scribes.
  
  
Now, the old prison was thought to be long abandoned until rumours out of Falkreath started spreading. According to some of the locals a tribe of particularly gruesome outlaws have laid claim to the site, using the old prison as their home. However, some Falkreath locals claim to be hearing more and more wolf howls from the base of the mountain, sparking rumours of something more occult in nature. In light of these rumours, Keeper Carcette of the Vigilants of Stendarr has sent out a party to investigate the prison.
