[font=Comic Sans MS]The Ruins of Mharzurk
  
by venjhammet
  
  
 ﻿Travel to the Riften hold on the slopes of the Velothi Mountains and there you will find an old abandoned ebony mine called Erenir. But deep within this mine lies a hidden passage to the Ruins of Mharzurk. Sometime during the 2nd Era, a powerful scholar ventured into this ruin but was never heard from afterward. It was said that he carried with him two powerful relics which were a gift given to him by Sotha Sil. Now a group of bandits led by a brawny Orc leader has issued an order to search for these relics. Only you can disrupt their search before their leader can grab hold of the relics.
