*"The strange vaulted halls of Taarengrav Barrow are ancient indeed—possibly as old as Saarthal or Labyrinthian. Certainly to modern eyes, this barrow was constructed on no logical plan. Perhaps its arrangement has a mystic significance."*![](https://i.imgur.com/urEnofe.png)
  
  
**Lore**
  
  
Taarengrav Barrow is an ancient Nordic ruin in the Western Rift that served as a ritual place for the Dragon Cult eons ago. In the Merethic Era, Valdur, one of Ysgramor‘s legendary Five Hundred Companions, was entombed there and his spirit bound within the barrow after his death in battle against Sinmur the Terrible and his giant kin. 
  
  
Thousands of years later, Taarengrav Barrow's existance and location are all but forgotten, lost to the ages. Only an insignificant mine named after the once great barrow remains which has recently been shut down by the Jarl due to its instability and collapsing walls. 
  
  
Things are about to change when three unfortunate bandit brothers decide to seek their fortune in the abandonded Taarengrav Mine... 
  
  
**Mod Info**
  
  
Taarengrav Barrow is a lore-friendly dungeon mod that is supposed to feel very much like vanilla content and as if it's been there from the start. It is based on its appearance in [The Elder Scrolls Online](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Taarengrav). The dungeon can be found close to the Rift Imperial Camp (see map screenshot) and is also fully Radiant Quest enabled. Minimum Level is 6. 
  
  
**Lighting Options**Everybody's lighting/monitor setup and preferences are different. I myself like my dungeons rather dark but others prefer to have better vision. Thus, the mod comes with a FOMOD that provides three options (see screenshots for comparison):
  
  

  
1. Darker Version: This is my preferred version and is based on the lighting templates that [Ambiance](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46383) uses.
Brighter Version: This is closer to Vanilla Lighting, although still a bit darker than the average Nordic Crypt. Use this if you prefer brighter lighting. It might also work better with some ENBs. 
  
2. Vanilla Version (Brightest): For those who like Vanilla Lighting in dungeons, this mostly uses the same lighting template as Vanilla Bleak Falls Barrow.

  
**Compatibility**
  
Since the mod only makes some minor worldspace edits (entrance to the dungeon) it should be compatible with almost everything. Let me know if you find any incompatibilities, patching those shouldn't be an issue. 
  
  
The mod now comes with an optional patch for DeltaRider's [The Dragon Cult - A Draugr Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81422), making the new Draugr types spawn in the dungeon. 
  
  
[Lux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43158) also comes with a patch for Taarengrav Barrow, just check the box in Lux‘s FOMOD installer. 
  
  
**Notes**
  
Followers should be able to follow you throughout the entire dungeon. In some cases, you might need to wait an hour or simply keep moving, they will catch up eventually.
