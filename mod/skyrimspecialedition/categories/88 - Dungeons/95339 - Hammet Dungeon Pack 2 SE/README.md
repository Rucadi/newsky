Following dungeons that are compiled in this pack are listed below:
  
  
Aldnzark Vault - West of Dragon Bridge stands Aldnzark Vault, a forgotten Dwemer tower now occupied by Hulgaar and his bandits. Drawn by the promise of rare geode minerals, their mining efforts are stalled by relentless Dwemer automatons. Unbeknownst to them, a powerful relic lies hidden deep within, fiercely protected by its ancient guardians.
  
  
Anchazgar - head to Solstheim just north of Earth Stone there you will find a dead person. Loot and read his journal and your quest will begin.
  
  
Blood Iron Veil - thousands of years ago there was this powerful dunmer warrior named Alathorn, a member of the dragonguard who built a Sanctuary West of Windhelm but somehow disappeared along with the abandonment of the tower. Until recently an unusual activity had been occurring in that particular place and the Vigilant of Stendarr went to investigate. Rumor has it that a group of vampires has been seen occupying that tower.
  
  
Brimspire - a small group of Daedric worshippers has taken refuge in an old abandoned imperial prison tower just North of Karthwasten and they intend to make human sacrifices to awake a powerful necromancer. You must head to the tower and stop their evil plan.
  
  
Btharkel - A long-forgotten Dwemer ruin located west of the Shrine of Peryite. Now occupied by bandits, the ancient halls hide a long-buried secret, sealed behind a chamber guarded by a powerful sentinel. Only the brave will uncover what lies within.
  
  
Darkfrost End - located northeast of Winterhold, a secluded sanctuary veiled in mystery. For generations, it has been safeguarded by the enigmatic order of the Mythic Dawn. However, recent disturbances have stirred the tranquility of this ancient place.
  
  
Darkleaf Grotto - Far north of Rorikstead lies a dark, misty cave known as Darkleaf Grotto. In its depths, an ambitious warlock seeks to become a powerful necromancer. Driven by determination, he is committed to mastering this dark craft and attaining immense power.
  
  
Frey's Dagger Mine - an abandoned Mine occupied by bandits located west of Helgen.
  
  
Hilleye Cabin - a dilapidated house that lies on the southeast of Dragon Bridge where a group of necromancers has settled in this place hidden beneath an underground cavern determined to unlock the dark secret it holds.
  
  
Narzak's Vault - a new quest awaits you northwest of Narzurbul on the Eastmarch hold. Find Drift Rock Cave and gain entrance into the dwemer ruin. There you will encounter a group of bandits that made camp waiting for their other companion to arrive before heading in to retrieve a powerful relic weapon hidden inside the ruin.
  
  
Nirnmire Grotto - an old Nordic ruin that lies far south of Dragonbridge. This dungeon is filled with poisonous gases and no one has been able to venture into its depths. Until recently the poisonous gases somehow receded and a small group of Forsworn has managed to enter the dungeon determined to find the hidden relic beneath the catacombs.
  
  
Silent Vale - a thousand years ago there was a great battle on the land of Vominheim. Prince Valdgar and his men stormed the Temple of Ingimund to destroy a powerful necromancer named Vuldur who had built an army and plans to invade and destroy Skyrim. Though they succeeded in defeating Vuldur they were also decimated by the minions of Molag Bal.  This ruin lies southeast of Whiterun just east of Fort Neugrad and is believed to be the resting place of the bear prince Valdgar.
  
  
Silver Yol - an ancient Nordic ruin just northeast of Ivarstead. Conquer the dungeon and destroy the powerful enemies that lurk in the depths and wield the weapon hidden beneath the catacombs.
  
  
Skullgrim Crypt - far east of Whiterun lies the tomb of Huldjorn, a once powerful warrior who was executed for his betrayal of the ruler of Markarth a thousand years ago.
  
  
Twin Sonaak - far south of Rorikstead lies a Nordic ruin where a powerful twin brother who wields the power of necromantic arts lies buried for more than a thousand years. Venture into the depths of those forbidden catacombs and claim their power.
  
  
Volengrim - southwest of Winterhold lies a dwemer ruin overrun by bandits. A powerful relic is buried beneath this dungeon, however, the bandits are unable to retrieve it due to the poisonous gas that has engulfed the hallways.
