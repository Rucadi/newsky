[font=Comic Sans MS]Hammet's Folly
  
by: venjhammet
  
  
 ﻿The Disciples of Vuldur, under the fervent leadership of Agnur, have fixated their attention on the ancient Ayleid ruins nestled deep within the recesses of Hammet's Folly. Agnur's obsession drives him to unlock the secrets of the crypt, harboring ambitions to evoke a potent Lich. Situated just west of Valthume, Hammet's Folly beckons brave souls to delve into its depths.
  
  
 ﻿Embark on a perilous journey through the mines to uncover Morinsel, an Ayleid labyrinth teeming with mysteries. Stand against the cult's sinister machinations and thwart their nefarious designs before they come to fruition. With its formidable challenges, this semi-hard dungeon offers no easy feat, boasting three expansive cells awaiting courageous adventurers like yourself.
  
  
 ﻿This dungeon is for the Anniversary Edition only. Requires the creation club addon The Cause and Necromantic Grimoire. Please do not attempt to use it for old SE, even though it uses files ccbgssse067-daedinv.esm and ccvsvsse003-necroarts.esl from the creation club. It was build on the Anniversary Edition v1.6.353. Downgrade port to SE was not possible.
  
  
The incompatibility will be a conflict of location on other mods.
  
  
 ﻿This is compatible with all of my Standalone Dungeons, Hammet Dungeon Pack 1 & 2, Valefrost and New Vominheim. This mod is not SKSE-dependent. Requires AE v1.6.353. Can be used for v1.6.640, GOG version, v1.6.1130.0.8 and the latest v1.6.1170.0.8.
