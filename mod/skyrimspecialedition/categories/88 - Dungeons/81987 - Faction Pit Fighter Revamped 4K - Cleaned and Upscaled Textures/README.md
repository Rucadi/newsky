[font=Georgia]After improving my techniques at upscaling armor and weapons, this is one of the first mods that I wanted to do. It expands on the original Pit Fighter mod so much, and brings an amazing collection of armor and weapons into the game by a score of very talented mod authors. I truly think it's the best arena mod ever made for Skyrim, and I'm very excited to be able to offer improved textures of all these amazing assets. Thank you to all the original mod authors who either left open permissions or granted me theirs. See the credits section here and on the original mod page.
  
  
Original textures were mostly in old BC1 and BC3 compression in a variety of resolutions, mostly 1K and 2K or below. I cleaned them of compression artifacts and upscaled them using [chaiNNer](https://github.com/chaiNNer-org) and [ESRGAN models](https://upscale.wiki/wiki/Model_Database) to a maximum of 4K, and re-compressed in [modern BC7 format](https://www.reedbeta.com/blog/understanding-bcn-texture-compression-formats/).
  
Performance options are available for potato PCs.

We know from experience that modding is an extremely addictive past-time and can be a slippery slope from creating a simple load order to porting mods to going full boat and attempting to rebuild Skyrim from the ground up. That's why we believe in a community that integrates Xbox and PC gamers along with porting noobs and experienced mod authors. We all have more to learn, and modding Skyrim to its extreme is a community effort to say the least.
