**Description

Exploring the same Nordic dungeons over and over again can get a little boring. Fortunately, with this mod you can finally get some variety! This mod uses the Glacial Nordic Ruins modders resource and changes the Nordic assets in selected dungeons to its custom icy variants. Approximately 90% of the Nordic assets in these dungeons, including clutter, containers, furniture, and animated doors, are now covered in ice! All modified dungeons are located in the cold regions of Skyrim, so you won't encounter an icy dungeon in the middle of the forest.**

Currently 8 dungeons have been changed (5 in main file and 3 as additions to the main file).

  
**Full list of changed dungeons:**
  
[Yngol Barrow](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Yngol_Barrow) (Exterior/Interior)
  
[Yngvild](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Yngvild) (Exterior/Interior)
  
[Forsaken Cave](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Forsaken_Cave) (Interior)
  
[Ironbind Barrow](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Ironbind_Barrow) (Interior)
  
[Skybound Watch Pass](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Skybound_Watch_Pass) (Interior)
  
[Snow Veil Sanctum](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Snow_Veil_Sanctum) Add-on (Interior)
  
[Champion's Rest](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Champion%27s_Rest) Add-on (Interior)
  
[Sivdur's Respite](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Sivdur%27s_Respite) Add-on (Interior)
  
  
**Important:** Dungeons will look different depending on which ice retexture you have installed.
  
  
Huge thanks to [FuzzBeed](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/TheOneTrueFuzzBeed/mods?gameId=1704)﻿ for making Glacial Nordic Ruins resource, without these assets, this mod probably wouldn't exist.
