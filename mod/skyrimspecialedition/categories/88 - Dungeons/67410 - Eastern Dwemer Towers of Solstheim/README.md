This is a relatively simple mod that adds [Morrowind styled dwemer towers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/190) (retextured to match Solstheim's dwemer colour scheme) to the various ruins around Solstheim as well as bringing the exterior of Falbtharz up to the local design code.
  
  
In replacing the assets outside Falbtharz, this mod also fixes a mismatched lift at its exit, which was previously Solstheim kit inside and skyrim kit outside.
  
  
This package also contains various other external pieces of the resource with the updated textures applied, if you wish to use them. *No thanks is needed from me to use these, but please do ensure that you credit David Brasher and Enter\_77 for the original work.*This mod has been flagged as both an ESL and ESM to both save on your plugin count *and* handle large references properly.
