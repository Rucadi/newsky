This mod uses [SkyPatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106659) to gives glasses from [Glasses Pack Vol. 1](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/115653) to [Remiel-Custom Voiced Dwemer Specialist and Companion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51874?tab=description) by MapleSpice
  
  
You have 2 choices:
  
1. Round Glasses - Black
  
2. Round Glasses - Metal
  
  
If requested I can provide more options
  
  
The replacer being used it [The Practical Dwemechanic](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63619).
  
  
Note: This mod works by adding the glasses to Remiel's Default Outfit so if have anything that changes it to something else without using the same editor ID this mod wont' work.
