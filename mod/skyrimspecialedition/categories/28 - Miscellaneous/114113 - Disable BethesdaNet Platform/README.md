# Disable BethesdaNet Platform

ESL plugin that is empty with a ini file that adds:
  
  
[Bethesda.net]
  
bEnablePlatform=0
  
  
Which from my understanding, disables the game from auto connecting to Bethesda Net or whatever online server they use to broadcast their annoying creation club news or the mod of the month message in main menu.
  
  
You can copy and add the two lines above into your main skyrim.ini (portable mod organizer users have their own ini in Modding/MO2/Profiles) and you will get the same result. However, some people use different instances of the game had have several skyrim.ini. This mod is useful for people who don't like updating their ini, just download and install this mod with any mod manager. Or enable it manually if you know how.
  
  
Got the idea from [m8r98a4f2](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/users/13457320)'s mod [Disable Creation Club - Remove Main Menu News](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/57041)﻿, I was curious to see if it works for Skyrim SE and it does in fact work.
  
  
There have been other mods that edit the startmenu.swf to remove the main menu news from showing like [Wirodeu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/1821023)'s [Clean Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3223), which works by hiding the text on the screen by editing the main menu display file. Whereas, my mod disables the text from ever being generated by the game.
  
  
Note: The creation club tab and installed content are still in the in game pause menu sadly and not greyed out the like creations tab in main menu (unfortunately).
  
  
I made the esl plugin with latest SSEEdit. If you crash on older verisions of the game try downloading [Backported Extended ESL Support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441)﻿. (Ugh, have to put this disclaimer on every mod I release with a plugin, tHaNkS aLoT bEtHeSdA.)
  
  
Fun fact: Bethesda actually disables the news by default for version 1.597 Skyrim. Which is pretty funny actually. I remember it was along the lines of a message on screen informing me that I was playing on an outdated verision of the game.
