This mod will make the santa-looking weirdo (Agrane Peryval) and his camp only appear in Saturalia/New Life surrounding dates, in concrete from 17 Evening Star to 7 Morning Star (17 Dec - 7 Jan). The rest of the (in game) year, they won't be there.
  
  
**About the reindeer:**
  
- If you **HAVE** purchased the reindeer, the reindeer won't be considered part of the camp, it is yours ever, and will never be gone (not by this mod, at least).
  
- If the reindeer has **NOT** been purchased, the reindeer shall be considered part of the camp and it will dissappear along the rest of the camp. In the eventuality that you have stolen the reindeer, it won't dissapear while you're mounting it or when it is near you, but once it gets out of your sight, it will dissapear (a Saturalia miracle!)
