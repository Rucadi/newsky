The Ring of Hircine now simply grants the **Ring of Hircine** power as long as it's in your inventory (NO NEED TO EQUIP IT, YAY).
  
  
Less inventory, less "ring-switching", more convenience. Why not?
  
  
  
Huge thanks to **Hypebringer** [color=#ffffff]over on Simon Magnus' Discord[/color], without them this mod probably wouldn't be here now. They saved this project after I've been smashing my head against scripting, brutishly trying to force it to work, while they elegantly turned it into something beautiful out of the sheer chadness of their heart.
  
  
**If you're updating from Version 1, make sure to clean your save with [Fallrim Tools](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5031/?tab=files) after uninstalling the previous version.**
  
  
Notes:
  
Spoiler -~~The Ring will still grant the Ring of Hircine Power unpon wearing it. I haven't managed to make it not grant it, though I don't think it's the worst inconsistency imaginable.~~**Version 2:** The Ring will now simply grant the Ring of Hircine Power when it's in your inventory, the previous implementation was
  
short-sighted in that it didn't take into account quests that track if the player used the Vanilla Ring of Hircine or Beast Form power (the previous one made a new power named "Beast Form" that wasn't taken into account).
  
  
-The trigger for the script is the Ring switching containers. If you loaded this mod while holding the Ring in your inventory, make sure you remove it from your inventory and add it back again.
