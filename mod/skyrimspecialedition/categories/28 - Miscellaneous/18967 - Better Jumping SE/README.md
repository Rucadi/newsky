This is a port to SSE of the original Skyrim mod [Better Jumping](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65044) by meh321 with permission from the original authors. 
  
  
Momentum was added to the latest version.

**What it does?**
  
Allows sprint jumping, double jump, changing jump height multipliers (compatible with other mods that change jump height) and some other things. None of this works with horses. By default only sprint jump is enabled.
  
  
It's SKSE64 plugin, no ESP. You can find a text file in **"Data/SKSE/Plugins/BetterJumpingSE.txt"** there you can configure how many times you can jump and all other settings.
  
  
Requires SKSE64 and latest SSE version.
