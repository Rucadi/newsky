[font=Georgia]**Description**
  
[/font][font=Georgia]Rebuild a farm, hire workers, grow crops, and earn gold!
  
  
Heljarchen Farm is a player-owned farm that allows you to rebuild a once-abandoned property into a functional farming business. Restoring the farm to its former glory will reward the player with income every day and the ability to harvest crops grown on the farm fields. The farm can even be upgraded further with the construction of a small meadery and guardhouse, allowing you to earn gold from a meadery operation, with guards protecting your goods against thieves.
  
  
As the name suggests, the farm is located within The Pale next to Heljarchen Hall and the Loreius Farm.
  
  
Cleaned with SSEEdit.
  
  
**New Features**
  
**New Structures**New buildings have been added to construct:
  
  
**Stone Wall** around the property
  
**Alchemy Store** (Earn gold or stockpile ingredients/potions)
  
**Alchemy Greenhouse** (Additional Planters)
  
**Cavern** (Additional planters and housing for a brewer, alchemist, maid, and two additional guards)
  
**Manor** (Housing for the Dragonborn)
  
  
  
**Overhauled Construction System**
  
The construction system used in Hearthfire (and Windstad Mine) has been implemented.  No longer will you have to deal with the clunky menu system with the old version of this mod.  Also includes a procurement system to obtain Hearthfire building materials (Sawn Log, Goat Horns, Glass, etc.)
  
  
  
**Revamped Business System**
  
  
Similar to Windstad Mine, a similar system has been implemented - you can now trade goods for gold, or stockpile goods for use in your adventures (food, alchemy ingredients, potions)

**Features**
  
  
**Construction**
  
Collect materials gathered in the province of Skyrim to repair a derelict farm, or hire construction workers to do the job for you.
  
  
**Grow plants and crops**
  
Use the farmyard to grow food for your travels. This can be useful for mods such as Realistic Needs and Diseases - use grown food to . A repaired meadery meanwhile can provide a nice source for your own brewed mead as well.
  
  
**Earn Gold or Stockpile Produce**
  
Choose whether to profit from your farm, meadery, and alchemy store... or fuel your adventures with its produce.  Order your workers to trade produced goods for gold to fund your adventures, or stockpile grown ingredients for personal use.
  
  
**Banners**
  
Proudly show your affiliation with the Stormcloaks or Imperials around the farm, or fly a more simple banner around your farm for decoration.
  
  
[/font][/center][font=Georgia]**Compatibility and Requirements**
  
  
  
Requires Skyrim Special Edition.
  
  
This mod will not be compatible with any mod that alters the cell it is located in (the cell next to the Loreius farm and Heljarchen Hall). Because of this, it will also not work well with any mod that makes drastic changes to the Skyrim landscape such as Seasons of Skyrim, Tropical Skyrim, etc.
  
  
It also makes some very minor additions to a few inns across Skyrim (pamphlets posted inside inns advertising the sale of the farm), and a vendor inside the Drunken Huntsman who sells the deed to the farm.[/font]

[font=cambria]**Known Issues**[/font]
  
**Farm Income**
  
  
For *v1.45* and later:
  
1. Gold sometimes doesn't accumulate. This is generally caused whenever you use the 'wait' or 'sleep' feature through the time where gold and items are added to the chests (8:00 AM In-Game). However, playing through this time normally will add gold and items to the chests as normal.
  
  
For *v1.4* and older:
  
There have been some reports of the income script not functioning properly, namely some players unable to collect gold earned from the farm. After some testing (Thanks [jjb54](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/5817399/?)) it is recommended that you do the following: 1. Back up your saves and make a clean save before installing this mod and repairing the farm (This should be performed whenever installing a new mod for your game). 2. Wait 8-12 in-game Skyrim hours after hiring workers before initializing the income script. 3. Take note of the coin sacks and gold coins around the business ledger. If they do not appear, gold income is not available yet. As a general rule, the coin purses on the lower left of the table indicate farm income. The bottom right indicates meadery income, and the top left portion of the table indicates bonus gold income.
