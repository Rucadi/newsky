**~VIGILANT~**
  
➤ Misc Item Descriptions
  
REQUIRES[Description Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/105799)
  
Patch to give all the miscellaneous items from VIGILANT Descriptions.
  
Primarily in the form of flavor text or to explain their practical use.
  
*It is highly encouraged that you use a mod to expand the item card size, since the longitude of some descriptions cannot fit on the vanilla space, and will appear cut-off.*
  
  
➤ Dragonborn's Bestiary Addon
  
REQUIRES [The Dragonborn's Bestiary](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/123521)
  
Gives most of the creatures from VIGILANT unique hand written bestiary entries
  
  
➤ No Thalmor Weapons
  
Removes the Thalmor weapons list from Coldharbour enemies, so that they won't be using Thalmor equipment.
  
The vanilla leveled list for the Thalmor only includes Elven, Steel and Glass weapons so this is normally not an issue.
  
but if you have mods that implement exclusive Thalmor themed weapons to the faction.
  
enemies from Coldharbour will spawn with these too.
  
This patch prevent this by giving them an unique leveled list.
  
  
➤ No Early Daedric Weapons
  
REQUIRES THE [VOICED ADDON](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11894)
  
Removes the lootable Daedric weapons from the Daedra Summons you encounter on the first act of VIGILANT'S questline:
  
For Vernaccus, Kathutet, Amkaos, Orthe, Ranyu and Genghis.
  
*Patch available for**[Additional Dremora faces](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97946)VIGILANT - patch. to ensure compatibility between the mods*
  
*(Just select 1 version, both are standalone)﻿*
  
  
➤Nerfed Jewelry Magic effects
  
Just Nerfs every magic effect on jewelry by 50%
  
except those that don't contain percentages on their description.
  
  
➤ Smaller Belharza's Dragon Knight Tower Shields
  
Scales down the tower shields used by Belharza's Knights by either 25% or 50% because the original size is incredibly enormous
  
(You can see in the images the size comparations)
  
  
➤ No Multi-hit Swings
  
Some weapons from VIGILANT *(E.g. the Moonlight sword and Greatsword)*have the ability to hit all the targets in front of you on a swing
  
This patch removes this ability and you will only hit 1 target like vanilla Skyrim.
  
*(it won't affect bosses or enemy weapons)*
  
useful if you have other mods that already cover this function or you usually hit your allies with these weapons.
  
  
➤ EVG Conditional Modesty Idle Exclusion
  
REQUIRES [EVG Conditional Idles](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34006)
  
No Shame for the wicked.
  
Excludes the NPCS from VIGILANT from using the "Modesty" Idle animation, so your Aedra, Daedra, Undead etc...
  
will not cover their bodies in shame despite (practically) don't being nude.
  
  
➤ Vigil Enforcer Armor Distribution
  
REQUIRES [SPID](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869) & [VIGIL ENFORCER ARMOR SET](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Vigil_Enforcer_Armor_Set)
  
Makes every vigilant of Stendarr *(from  VICN VIGILANT)* wear the vigil enforcer armor and it's variations.
  
updated to work with the latest version of VIGILANT.
  
- Holy Pipers and Corrupted Vigilants will wear the corrupted set (Holy Pipers won't lose their unique helmets)
  
- Important Vigilants will wear the Veteran Sashed Versions
