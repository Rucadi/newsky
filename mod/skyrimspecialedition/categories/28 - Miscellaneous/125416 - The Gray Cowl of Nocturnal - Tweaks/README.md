**~The Gray Cowl of Nocturnal~**
  
➤ Misc Item Descriptions
  
REQUIRES [Description Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/105799) & [powerofthree's Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51073)
  
Patch to give all the miscellaneous items from The Gray Cowl of Nocturnal
  
Primarily in the form of flavor text or to explain their practical use.
  
*It is highly encouraged that you use a mod to expand the item card size, since the longitude of some descriptions cannot fit on the vanilla space, and will appear cut-off or incredibly small*
  
  
➤ Dragonborn's Bestiary Addon
  
REQUIRES [The Dragonborn's Bestiary](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/123521)
  
Gives most of the creatures from The Gray Cowl of Nocturnal unique hand written bestiary entries
  
SpoilerThe bestiary pictures were taken using [Hunt for Hammerfell](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/115802?tab=description) mod. it is not required but they look far better than the retextured creatures from the original mod
  
  
➤ Alternative Umbra Sword Scabbards
  
During your journey through the Cowl of Nocturnal you can acquire an unique Umbra Sword.
  
but the sword has a very (in my opinion) unfitting scabbard.
  
This simply gives you the choice between 3 options to change the sword's scabbard:
  
**No Scabbard** - Removes the Steel Sword Scabbard completely.
  
**Ebony Scabbard** - Gives it a reshaped ebony sword scabbard from the vanilla game.
  
**Black Scabbard** -  Adjusts and retextures the default scabbard with a black texture.
  
  
➤ Umbra Sword Tweaked
  
The Sword is very broken stat wise as it deals 24 damage
  
(thats the damage a Daedric Greatsword deals. and the strongest vanilla one handed sword deals 16 damage)
  
this plugin  simply reduces the damage to 15 (Dragonbone Sword damage) 
  
And renames it to Antumbra to distinguish it from other Umbra swords from other mods
