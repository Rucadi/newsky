# Donate More Gold To Maramal (And More)

**DESCRIPTION**
  
  
In vanilla Skyrim, when you inquire to [Maramal](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Maramal) about the temple accepting charity, he will inform you they are taking donations. You then have the option of paying 5 gold as charity towards the temple. This is repeatable, and the gold is deposited into a locked chest in front of the alter. This mod expands this interaction...
  
  
 ■  Donate more than the default amount (5, 25, 50, and 100)...
  
 ■  Applies the [Gift of Charity](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Gift_of_Charity) to your character after donating (like other charity)...
  
 ■  Fixes a **critical bug** where you could still select "donate" even if you somehow possess less than 5 gold...
  
 ■  Changes the donation chest from a [Leveled Lock](https://www.creationkit.com/index.php?title=Reference#Lock) to a static lock (you can still lockpick it)... *(Optional Plugin)*
  
 ■  Distributes a key for the donation chest to Maramal's inventory (via [Spell Perk Item Distributor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869))... *(Optional Plugin)*
  
  
Unlike with beggars, you will NOT raise your [disposition](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Disposition) with Maramal.

**WHY?**
  
  
To add some additional options for you and your character when roleplaying. I took writing that already existed in the game and repurposed it for the newly presented dialogue options - it should fit in seamlessly with the base game. In fact, I've even created the absolute dumbest method to get the absolute worst timed buff in the entire game for free.
  
  
The gift and burden of playing Bethesda titles is the moment you try to change anything you discover a dozen things wrong with it.
  
Clearly, this is unnecessary. But you're already on this mod page. So why not...?
  
  
  
**COMPATIBILITY**
  
  
Highly compatible, doesn't overwrite vanilla scripts, nothing really edits this dialog topic. Could potentially require manual patching.
  
Cross referenced with my load order. Nothing conflicted. For the optional plugin, please place *before* your lighting mod. No NPC edits.
