**PARTICLE LIGHTS
  
  
 A much needed change for the torchbug and moth in a jar items, adds light sources to them.
  
  
For ENB users. This mod utilizes the particle lights feature of ENB. Requires 0.365 or newer.****Installation
  
  
 ﻿     "EnableComplexParticleLights" should be turned on in the Effects section and "EnableBigRange" in the [COMPLEXPARTICLELIGHTS] section.**Since I only changed the meshes, any retexture mod should work fine.
  
  
  
**!!! OVERWRITING THE MESHES WILL MAKE THIS MOD REDUNDANT AND YOU WILL NOT GET ANY LIGHT FROM THEM !!!**
