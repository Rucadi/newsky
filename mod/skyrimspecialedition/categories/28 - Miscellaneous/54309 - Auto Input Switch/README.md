# Auto Input Switch

This mod makes it possible to switch between gamepad and keyboard/mouse control on the fly. Similar to many other games, it will simply detect when you switch between devices and update the UI accordingly.
  
  
The user preference setting **Gameplay -> Controller** (bGamepadEnable:Main in INI prefs) will still be respected when this mod is installed, so make sure that it is enabled in order to benefit from the changes.
