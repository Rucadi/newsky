I was annoyed that the thief would spawn right as soon you get into Riften and starting the quest super early. This mod makes the thief not spawn until you've completed all four special city jobs for the thieves guild. All I did was link the npc reference to the thieves guild stage 4 xmarker, so when that enables he spawns at the cemetery.
