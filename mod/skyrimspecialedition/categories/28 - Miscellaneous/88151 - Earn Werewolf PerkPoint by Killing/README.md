Earn werewolf perk points by killing enemies instead of feed. Compatible with everything. Install/Uninstall at any time.
  
  
Work well with any mod that use vanilla way (feed) to get werewolf perk points. However you will get your werewolf progress accelerate. (Just for compatibility, use optional file to avoid this)
  
  
Optional a script file that replace vanilla way to get werewolf perk points so that you won't get werewolf perk pointsby feed. (Recommend, more vanilla, only incompatible with mod that use other way to get werewolf perk points.)

杀死敌人就可以获得狼人点数，没有重复的啃食。
  
为了兼容性保留了啃食获得点数，可选的文件删除了这一方式。
