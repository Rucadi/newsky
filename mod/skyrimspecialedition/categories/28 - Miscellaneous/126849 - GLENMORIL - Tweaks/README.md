A collection of modular tweaks and edits for GLENMORIL. 
  
Meant to enhance the experience, create synergy between other mods
  
or simply fix pet peeves
  
All the files are ESL Flagged.
  
  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
  
  
➤ Misc Item Descriptions
  
REQUIRES [Description Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/105799)
  
Patch to give all the miscellaneous items from GLENMORIL Descriptions.
  
Primarily in the form of flavor text or to explain their use.
  
*It is highly encouraged that you use a mod to expand the item card size, since the longitude of some descriptions cannot fit on the vanilla space, and will appear cut-off or incredibly small*
  
  
➤ Dragonborn's Bestiary Addon
  
REQUIRES [The Dragonborn's Bestiary](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/123521)
  
Gives unique hand written entries to the abominations of GLENMORIL in the bestiary
  
  
➤ Vigil Enforcer Armor Distribution
  
REQUIRES [VIGIL ENFORCER ARMOR SET](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Vigil_Enforcer_Armor_Set)
  
The Holy Pipers are Excommunicated Vigilants, to maintain the consistency between them
  
this plugin gives every (human) holy piper the corrupted version of the Vigil Enforcer Armor.
  
(it won't remove their unique "helmets")
  
  
➤ No Stormcloak Volunteers
  
During a certain quest, you venture to the Nord-Dunmer settlement of ***Ebonwall***
  
During the quest a Nord militia is formed to confront the riots in the city, but for some reason this volunteer militia wears stormcloak armor.
  
this simply changes the volunteer army armor from Stormcloak to Steel
  
(it is said that the army is made of nord citizens not actual stormcloaks)
