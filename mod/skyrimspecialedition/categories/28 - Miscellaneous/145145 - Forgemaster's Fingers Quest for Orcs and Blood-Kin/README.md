The Forgemaster's Fingers is a quest I don't end up doing a lot either because I'm playing as an orc or I've already helped one of the Orcs that gives you bloodkin before arriving at a stronghold.
  
  
To start the quest as an Orc or Bloodkin, talk to the guard who would normally try to talk you out of entering the stronghold.
  
(Arob, Bagrak, Nagrub, Yatul)
  
  
Quest plays as normal except for some dialogue differences to make things still make sense. (playing normally will be unchanged)
  
  
Doing the quest this way also results in a small gold reward as there's no reward from the quest other than getting blood-kin. (no gold if you're not a blood-kin)
