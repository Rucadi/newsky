**Load order tip**: load as high as possible, ideally right after USSEP.

Two versions.

The **complete** one includes all Skyrim and DLC locations, Dwemer and not.
  
  
I have added all the barred doors, gates, grates, portcullises, and bridges I could find -- **in case I've missed some** [not so improbable], **anyone is welcome to helpfully point them out**.
