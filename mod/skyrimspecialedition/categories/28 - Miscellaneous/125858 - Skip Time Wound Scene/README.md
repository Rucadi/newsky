[font=Verdana]**Description:**[/font]
  
  
Skips the scene with the elder scroll to learn Dragonrend.
  
Mainly because it's simply faster but also chances are that the scene sometimes doesn't play that well
  
  
Note, this is basically a quick and dirty way around the scene. It won't cause any issues, but it also does not solve anything wrong with that scene.
  
  
Now when you read the Elder Scroll on top of the mountain, there's just some expected effects, a white-out screen and it's done.
  
You still learn Dragonrend, but it doesn't play the shout music and text, you just have it in your magic menu.
  
  
This mod is a script replacer (without esp file) and i made sure to leave anything that matters from the vanilla script as is.
  
  
[font=Verdana]**Compatibility:**[/font]
  
  
This mod edits 2 scripts:
  

  
1. ElderScrollScript.pex
﻿QF\_MQ206\_00036193.pex
  

I do not know which other mods change it and i will probably only patch for mods i also use, if necessary.
  
  
[font=Verdana]**Installing:**[/font]
  
  
At least before reading the elder scroll on top of the mountain, obviously.
  
  
**[font=Verdana]Uninstall:[/font]**
  
  
Whenever, just don't uninstall it when you read the scroll before you killed Alduin. Obviously.

[Andrealphus VIII](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5646623) for the [Exploit Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46753) to disable elder scroll reading while swimming (i had to write the same check in my script in order to patch it. Sadly there's no way to make the mod a dependency)
