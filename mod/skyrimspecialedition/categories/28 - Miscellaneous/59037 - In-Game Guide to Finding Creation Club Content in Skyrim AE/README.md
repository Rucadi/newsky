With the Skyrim Anniversary update, Creation Club quests no longer auto-start when installed. While I personally see this as an improvement, I have seen comments from others who don't. The Creation Club menu gives a brief description on how to find things, but it's awkward to use and doesn't always have enough detail, and so I wrote this guide.
  
  
This mod adds a guidebook to your inventory when installed, with detailed instructions on how to find all Creation Club content in Skyrim Anniversary Edition. The book is marked as a quest item so you can't accidentally drop it. Does not require any Creation Club content, but obviously you won't find the content described if you don't have it.
  
  
If you don't want an in-game guide, there's also a text document available for download, or just read it here:
  
  
Adventurers Backpack
  
Backpacks can be crafted at any forge or bought from general traders.
  
  
Alternative Armors (x15)
  
Various alternative armors can be bought from blacksmiths or found as random loot. Each of the 15 alternative armors has an associated quest which awards a full set and unlocks them for crafting. The individual quests are listed at the end of this guide.
  
  
Arcane Accessories
  
New spells and robes can be bought from mages or found as random loot. More advanced spells are only sold at the College of Winterhold and Tel Mithryn, and only once you meet certain skill requirements. Alternatively, go to Hob's Fall Cave, which is on the northern coastline between Winterhold and Dawnstar. About halfway through, there is an ancient tome chest containing all 16 new spell tomes.
  
  
Arcane Archer Pack
  
Elemental arrows can be crafted at a forge, bought from merchants, or found as random loot. To learn how to craft and use Telekinesis Arrows, pick up the research notes and spell tome in the Arcanaeum at the College of Winterhold. To learn how to craft Soul Stealer Arrows, go to Kagrumez on Solstheim, then complete the trials and pick up the Dwemer Arrow Diagram amongst the loot.
  
  
Arms of Chaos
  
Go to Skytemple Ruins, on an island north of Winterhold. Hyenril's journal is on a stone table, and starts the quest The Arms of Chaos.
  
  
Bittercup
  
Go to the Dead Man's Drink in Falkreath. In one of the rooms, there is a journal labelled Mysterious Altar, which starts the quest A Dying Wish. Note that you can choose one of three things at the altar, and each option has different quests and rewards, so choose wisely.
  
  
Bloodchill Manor
  
Upon reaching level 12, a courier will deliver a dinner invitation, which starts the quest Guests for Dinner.
  
  
Bone Wolf
  
If you have not already done so, go to the Blue Palace in Solitude and speak to Falk Firebeard about Wolfskull Cave, starting The Man Who Cried Wolf. Some time after completing this quest, a courier will deliver a letter from Falk Firebeard, starting The Wolf Queen Awakened. After completing these two vanilla side quests, a courier will deliver a letter from Bolgeir Bearclaw, starting the quest Let Sleeping Wolves Lie.
  
  
Bow of Shadows
  
Go to Dragonsreach in Whiterun, and ask the Jarl's steward if he needs anything. This starts the quest In the Shadows.

Camping supplies are crafted at a forge and can be used to build a campsite in the wilderness.

Chrysamere
  
Go to Forelhost, a nordic ruin on the mountain southeast of Riften. It is easiest to approach from the southeast. Chrysamere is wielded by the ghost of a lost paladin, beside the word wall at the end of the dungeon.
  
  
Civil War Champions
  
Enter the Drunken Huntsman in Whiterun. Depending on your involvement (or not) in the civil war, you will either find a note on the counter OR a courier will deliver a letter after you leave. Either way, this will start the quest Battle of the Champions.

Enter Candlehearth Hall in Windhelm, and go upstairs. Adonato Leotelli's journal is on one of the tables, and starts the quest Caught in a Web.

Divine Crusader
  
Go to Four Skull Lookout, atop the cliffs on the east side of the river Karth, south of Karthwasten. It is easiest to approach from the south. There you can take the Relics of the Crusader from two bodies, but are you worthy to wield them?

Fearsome Fists
  
Brawler's gauntlets can be found as random loot, bought from blacksmiths, or crafted with the relevant perks. 
  
  
Fishing
  
There are fishing spots dotted around Skyrim. Fishing rods and maps can be bought from general traders. Go to Riften Docks to start the questline. Note that fish can be found swimming in bodies of water throughout Skyrim, and it may be quicker to pick them up by hand rather than fishing.
  
  
Forgotten Seasons
  
On the map, look for the source of the Karth river which is southwest of Fort Sungard, about halfway between Markarth and Falkreath. In this area, go through Lost Valley Redoubt and continue to Runoff Caverns. Before entering the caverns, make sure to inspect the broken dwarven horse outside.
  
  
Gallows Hall
  
From Windhelm Stables, cross the bridge to the west, then turn left along a road which follows the river south. Watch for a road which splits off to the right towards Morvunskar fort. Instead of following this road, head due west up the hill to Mara's Eye Pond. Gallows Hall is set into the cliff face beside the pond.
  
  
Ghosts of the Tribunal
  
Go to Raven Rock on Solstheim, and enter the Temple through the main door. Go downstairs and read the Heretic Dossier in the room on the right, starting the Ghosts of the Tribunal questline.

Follow the swamp water east from Morthal. Once you reach Myrwatch, start the quest by taking Han's Journal from his body by a nearby tree stump.

New robes and conjuration spell tomes can be found in necromancer lairs. Phinis Gestor is able to sell the 13 new spells at the College of Winterhold, but will only have a small selection available at any given time.

Note that the objective to visit Fort Hraggstad near Solitude is optional, but there are some unique boots there.

Buy the Nix-Hound from Revus Sarvani near Tel Mithryn on Solstheim. If he is dead, go to Geldis Sadri at The Retching Netch in Raven Rock.

Saints & Seducers
  
Start the questline by speaking to Ri'saad, leader of the Khajiit caravans, who travels between Whiterun and Markarth. Along the way you will pick up miscellaneous quests leading to Nerveshatter, two Elytra pets and two sets of smithing instructions. After restoring order, a courier will deliver a request to meet. A unique spell tome can be created at the atronach forge using Sheogorath-shaped amber, ruined book, bliss bug thorax, and sabre cat pelt.
