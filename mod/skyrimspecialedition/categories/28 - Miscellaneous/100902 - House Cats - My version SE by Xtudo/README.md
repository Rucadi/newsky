[House Cats - Cat Follower - Ironclaw](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106105) ﻿by [hagbaby](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/103162303). A simple combat enabled cat follower using the vanilla animal follower system. What he lacks in features he more than makes up for with violence! :D
