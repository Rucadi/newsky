**Compatibility patches** for locations included in the all-in-one plugin
  

  
* Creation Club mod "Sunder and Wraithguard" (Sightless Pit).
Mod "Sunder and Wraithguard - Editable Vault Cell" (Sightless Pit).
  
* Mod "Interesting NPCs" -- Overrides: Angarvunde Catacombs, Greywater Grotto, Mara's Eye Den, Fort Sungard Tower.
Mod "Skyrim Sewers 4" -- Overrides: Fort Sungard Shrine, Nchuand-Zel (main), Bards College, Whiterun Catacombs, Hall of the Dead Windhelm, Palace of the Kings (ground floor), Fort Kastav Captain's Quarters, Fort Greenwall Prison.
  

**Optional fixes** depending on installed mods and/or personal preferences
  

  
* Abandoned Prison -- This is vanilla but optional and not included in the all-in-one plugin. Versions compatible with "Alternate Start - Live Another Life" and "Alternate Start Reborn" are available.
Quicksilver Mine -- This is vanilla but optional and not included in the all-in-one plugin. Not compatible with the "Vigil Enforcer Armor Set" creation.
  
* Mod "Interesting NPCs" -- Replaces and includes the compatibility patch, and improves iNPCs' locations.
Mod "Skyrim Sewers 4" -- Replaces and includes the compatibility patch, and improves Skyrim Sewers' locations.
  
* Mod "Vigilant SE" -- Improves Vigilant's locations. Edits just a few problematic cells.
Rift Watchtower exterior area, mainly meant to improve the movement on the stairs -- Compatible with USSEP but not with mods altering the area's layout.
  
* Tweak for *defaultNoEnemiesFollowDoorScript* -- Teammates who are not in the *CurrentFollowerFaction* or *PlayerFollowerFaction* can use the exit door in Broken Oar Grotto and three other doors elsewhere with the same script attached.

**WARNING**: Don't clean this mod. Should there be ITMs, they would be intentional.
  
  
**NOTE**: The all-in-one **Navigator.esl** is the recommended option and should be placed as high as possible in the load order, but always after USSEP and probably before USCCCP (if you have any of them).
  
If other mods edit the navmeshes in the same cells, hopefully they do it for a specific reason and should be allowed to override this one.
  
The alternative all-in-one Navigator.esp and the modular plugins can be used to override other mods, but you'd better know what you're doing.
  
  
**NOTE**: Should you want an all-in-one plugin with only some of the edited cells, you could merge the desired modular ones and save the result in the CK to build the info map.
  
Or you could delete the cells you don't want and the info map from the original all-in-one plugin, then re-save it in the CK to rebuild the info map.
  
  
**NOTE**: Even though this doesn't require USSEP, I made most of the edits with USSEP loaded in the CK, just in case.
