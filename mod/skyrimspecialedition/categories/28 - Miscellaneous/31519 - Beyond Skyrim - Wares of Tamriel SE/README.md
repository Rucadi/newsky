*Step aboard the Dawn's Venture, currently docked in Dawnstar, and meet the wayward traveller Cardana Pallo. Peruse her wares, stocked from lands beyond Skyrim, and see if she has any news from the other provinces...*
  
  
A teaser release from Beyond Skyrim, *Wares of Tamriel* adds a variety of new items from across the provinces to a fully-voiced merchant. Spend your gold on weapons from Elsweyr, purchase delicacies from Morrowind, look over the loot that awaits you in Roscrea, arm yourself with new equipment from Morrowind's New North, get to grips with Black Marsh's native Jel language, or have a chat about what's been happening in the provinces... all this and more awaits you on the Dawn's Venture.

***Wares of Tamriel* has no requirements**
  
Additionally, the mod is light on scripting and should have minimal compatibility issues, as it only adds new assets without affecting the core game. The only known incompatibilities are with other mods that edit the area around Dawnstar's harbor. Some issues may be solved by putting *WoT* lower in your load order, but many will require a 3rd party patch.
