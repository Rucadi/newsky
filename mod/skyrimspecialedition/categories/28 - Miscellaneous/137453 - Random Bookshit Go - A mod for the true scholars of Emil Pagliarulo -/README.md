So... here it is. I've collected the most cursed [r/trueSTL](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueSTL/) posts, had my way with them, then made them into "readable" books.
  
  
The books so far:
  
[A Letter of Plea from a Humble Argonian to the Wise of Windhelm](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueSTL/comments/1h93ceq/i_25margonian_just_moved_into_windhelm_a_while/)
  
[Breton Note](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueSTL/comments/10uavt2/)
  
[Confessions to a Justiciar](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueSTL/comments/1hja8r9/comment/m35u6u6/)
  
[Diaries of a Divine Hero](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueSTL/comments/1hnfibw/)
  
[Odes to a Peculiar Dunmer](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueSTL/comments/1hja8r9/karliah/)
  
[On Liberating the Reach](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueSTL/comments/1hca48g/)
  
[On the Arrest of The Gray Fox](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueSTL/comments/1hcgeyf/)
  
[On the Curious Origins of Mammoth Cheese](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueSTL/comments/1hbohin/)
  
[On the Daedric Hand in the Midden](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueSTL/comments/11108qa/)
  
[On the Perils of Politics and Courtship](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueSTL/comments/1hd70qf/)
  
[On the Physical Characteristics of the Argonian Species](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueSTL/comments/112b66z/)
  
[On the Reproductive Habits of the Elven Race](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueSTL/comments/118ayye/)
  
[Redguard Grudge](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueSTL/comments/1hja8r9/comment/m351vei/)
  
[The First Dragonbussy - A Historical Account](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueSTL/comments/1hm0tfk/)
  
[The Legend of The Airborne Albino](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyrimMemes/comments/1hfkzqz/comment/m2c7kto/)
  
[The Ramblings of an Insufferably Horny Reachman](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueSTL/comments/1henquh/)
  
[The Thesis of Archerization](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyrimMemes/comments/1hk7ud5/)
  
[The Troubles of a Bosmer Servant](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueSTL/comments/11hr87h/)﻿
  
  
Some books are skill books. They can be purchased with some chance from vendors that sell books anyway, but your best bet is [Urag gro-Shub](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Urag_gro-Shub) of course.
  
I'm planning on adding more books to the mod later if I find cursed-enough posts. So... in case you're a member of trueSTL and found a lengthy enough cursed, wholesome or awesome writing, feel free to [tag me](https://www.reddit.com/user/SirMephistoPheles2/) and I'll see what I can do. Until then, happy reading!
  
  
P.s: I still haven't figured out how to put custom covers as texture onto the books so they're mostly plain. If someone can teach me I'm more than willing to do it. I also took the liberty to rewrite some of the ramblings into a more lore-friendly and readable form, or if they weren't long enough, extended them but I tried to keep true enough to your ramblings.
