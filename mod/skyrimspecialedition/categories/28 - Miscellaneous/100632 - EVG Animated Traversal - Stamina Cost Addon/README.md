Climbing something is tiring! This adds a modest stamina drain of ten to twenty stamina to [EVG Animated Traversal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63232) (EVGAT), depending on which animation is used.
  
  
This is only a drain, **not** a minimum stamina requirement to do the maneuver. Most of the time this will be minor and unobtrusive. However, getting into a fight after climbing will leave you at a disadvantage from the lost stamina.
  
  
Easy (10 stamina): Vault, Duck, Short ladder, Squeeze, Failed Ledge, LadderSlide
  
Hard (20 stamina): Raider Drop, Raider Roll, Ledges, Wall Drops, Tall Ladder, Deep Walk
  
  
**Compatibility and Tweaking:**
  
Works by editing the EVGAT 'spells', I don't think anything else does so but future updates to EVGAT may require
  
updates to this addon. Built for EVGAT 1.02. Compatible with Skyclimb, Maleficus Traversal, and translations of EVGAT. I haven't checked all of the evgat mods but I doubt any of them edit the spells.
  
  
There's an optional file for doubled costs, it's very simple to adjust in xEdit if you want other values.
  
  
**Other Mods:**
  
If you like this, you'd probably like [Jumping Costs Stamina](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60529). There are several mods like it but this is the one I use.
  
  
[Exhaustion - Incremental Fatigue](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/94574) paired with this will make climbing a whole mountain lower your maximum stamina until you rest in a bed.
