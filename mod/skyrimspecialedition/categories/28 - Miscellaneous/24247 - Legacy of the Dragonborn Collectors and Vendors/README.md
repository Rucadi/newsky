This mod adds the following NPCs:
  

  
* The numismatist, a coin dealer, to The [Blue Palace](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Blue_Palace) in [Solitude](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Solitude)
The conchologist, a sea shell dealer, to [Clam Digger's Camp](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/File:SR-place-Clam_Digger%27s_Camp_02.jpg) northwest of [Northwatch Keep](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Northwatch_Keep)
  
* Synod archivist, a book dealer, to [Mzulft Aedrome](https://en.uesp.net/w/index.php?title=Skyrim:Mzulft#Mzulft_Aedrome)
The geologist, a gem dealer, to [Old Hroldan Inn](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Old_Hroldan_Inn)
  
You will be able to purchase [Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802) museum items from these vendors. Without this mod, the items had to be randomly found in chests or merchants with very low odds.
  
  
The mod is also flagged as ESL so it won't contribute to the 256 ESP limit.
