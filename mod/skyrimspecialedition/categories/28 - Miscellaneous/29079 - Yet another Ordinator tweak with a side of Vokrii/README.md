Slightly overhaul many of the perks added by the mod "Ordinator", while also adding some of the most interesting (in my opinion) effects from "Vokrii".
  
  
List of changes:
  
  
**Alchemy**
  
  
Stimulants: This effect duration as well as any beneficial potions duration is augmented by 1% per level of alchemy (compatible with the CACO-Ordinator patch)
  
  
Maenad: Removed the penalty to stamina and magicka when not under the effect of a potion. The boon when affected by beneficial potions is reduced from 50 to 25.
  
  
**Alteration:**
  
Alteration Mastery (rank 2):now increases the range of your targeted Alteration spells by 1% per alteration level
  
Alter Self: Now provide a 10% increased magic resistance.
  
Intuitive Magic: now only reduces the cost of spells by 80% instead of nullifying it.
  
Wild shrines: Reduced the bonus to 10%  increased magnitude (destruction, restoration, illusion) and 20% extended duration (alteration, conjuration)
  
  
**Archery:**Clean Kill -> Renamed Law Of Nature: You inflict 35% more damage with a bow to targets below half health *while you're at or above half health.* This effect also extend to other kind of weapons, although the damage boost will be of only 15%.
  
  
Steady Hand: Slightly increased zoom power
  
  
Crippling Shot:Lowered skill requirement to 30. Augmented the maximum distance for the slow effect to take place. Now also wound living targets for 5 points of damages during 10 seconds if hit while running (Same as its Vokrii counterpart)
  
  
Pinning Shot: Wound the undead like crippling shot wounded the livings if the same conditions are met.
  
  
Hunter's discipline: Now also give you access to very basics trick arrows (wound, slow, or dent armor.) For that, you will first have to build a misc item related to the intended effect (stack of barbed arrowheads, numbing substance, or corrosive solution) and apply it on steel arrows. The conversion rate for steel arrows to trick arrows is 15 to 10 to reflect that you're just beginning to learn how to craft these kind of arrows. Each arrow effect's magnitude or duration is dependant on your archery skill.
  
  
Hailstorm -> Elusive Target : Now give you instead a 4% bonus to movement speed after drawing a bow. Should prevent "weapon speed mult" kind of bugs.
  
  
Npc archery perk changes: Depending on their vanilla archery perks, they may be able too to wound running targets (including you) or slowing them down. So careful!
  
  
**Conjuration:**Conjuration mastery: Now also give you, through a toggleable spell, the possibility to cast your second most powerful reanimation spell (ie: the novice-level one if you know the apprentice one, the apprentice one if you know the adept one, and so on) for free during combat by activating a corpse if not controlling a minion, but it will last for only 50% (rank 1) or 75%(rank 2) of a standard reanimation spell. If the body "fails" to reanimate (a bug where the reanimation spell apply, but the body still don't move, likely because you activated it on a corpse that didn't "finished" its death animation) you may activate it again to disintegrate it. Additionally, the spell duration extension also apply to skeletal minions raised through the "Lord Of Bones" perk tree.
  
  
Lord Of Bones: No changes, other than the weight of all bones being reduced and the aforementioned duration extension.
  
  
Preservation: The duration of reanimation spells is multiplied by 3 for standard spells, 20 for "dread zombie" and "Dead Thrall" and 2 for the "activate" type spells.
  
  
Signed In Blood: Now just restore health and stamina to friendly daedras. Area augmented to 20 feets.
  
  
Undead Crown: Area augmented to 20 feets.
  
  
Edge of Oblivion: You can control one additional minion, but summoning or reanimating a minion will briefly weakens your defenses (each time you summon or reanimate a minion, you will lose 100 points of armor and 25% magic resistance, fading over 20 seconds).
  
  
March Of Oblivion: The threshold of base magicka for each additional summon is reduced from 250 to 150.
  
  
**Destruction:**Destruction Mastery: Now also increase the duration of destruction cloaks by 0.5%/1% per destruction level
  
  
Static Field->Conductive Field: hitting a casting target have a chance to interrupt them, nullify their magicka regeneration and reducing their maximum magicka by 50 points for a short while  (I tried removing the insta-25% damages, but it seemed hard-scripted)
  
  
Swapped the destruction skill requirements for "crystalyse" and "shatter" perks. The "shatter" perk will now also slow targets by 20%(not stackable) if they are not frost resistants
