[Meridia's Order](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/102584) introduces a new questline and faction into Skyrim where we serve once more as the Champion of Meridia. and i thought it made the perfect prelude to [Vicn's Vigilant](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11849)... so why not strength this connection by distributing items from Vigilant into the Meridia's Order questline?
  
  
This mod simply Integrates Armor, weapons. ingredients and ingestibles from Vigilant into the questline of Meridia's Order that would fit the narrative of the Questline.
