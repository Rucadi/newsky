How does it work?

  
OStim Director features a detailed MCM that allows you to create your own playlists of animations. It should be rather self explanatory so I won't go over it in detail here. Basically you can set up order and durations of the animations you want to play. Since selecting animations from a drop down list is rather inconvenient you can also add the currently playing animation of your OStim scene by pressing the H key (can be rebound in the MCM).
  
  
Once you have set up the playlist you can play it at will by pressing the Num3 key while in an OStim scene (can be rebound in the MCM) and selecting the desired playlist from the list. You can also play it on an NPCxNPC scene by pressing the Num3 key while looking at them (and not being involved in a scene yourself).
