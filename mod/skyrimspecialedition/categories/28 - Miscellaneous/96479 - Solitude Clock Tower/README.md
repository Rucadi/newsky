# Solitude Clock Tower

Requirements
  
None
  
  
Description
  
This mod adds clocks to each side of the tower of the Bards College. The clocks provide accurate time and will toll out the hour, every hour. You can hear the tolling bells from all over Solitude--including as far as the docks below.
  
  
Compatibility
  
Should be compatible with anything that doesn't drastically alter the position of the tower in the Bards College. The mod uses assets from Clockwork, so any mesh/texture/sound replacers for that mod will likewise affect this one. It should, in theory, also be compatible with mods like Open Cities or SR Exterior Cities, but I haven't tested this.
  
  
- Solitude Mods: Compatible
  
- JK's Bards College: Compatible
  
- Open Cities/SR Exterior Cities: Possibly Compatible (untested)
  
  
Future Plans
  
I don't plan on adding clock towers to the other major cities. Clockwork in this time period would be very rare, and likely restricted to large, urbanized cities. However, tolling out the hour through a bell is presumably not uncommon in any city that has them. So if there's enough interest, I might add the script to the other major cities--either as a standalone plugin, or as an addon for Bells of Skyrim.
