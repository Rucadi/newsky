# Turn in Contraband

This mod is really simple. If you have drugs (such as skooma or moon sugar) in your inventory, there will be a new dialogue option that appears when you talk to a guard: "I would like to turn in some contraband I found." When you select that dialogue option, you can choose what type of drug from your inventory you wish to turn in, then decide if you want to just turn in one bottle/bowl or all you have. You are then given a small reward for turning in the drugs (100 gold for skooma, 50 gold for moon sugar, and 200 gold for double-distilled skooma, redwater skooma, or sleeping tree sap by default).
  
  
**FAQ**-Why did you make this mod?
  
My current character has Inigo as a follower. After he urged me to get rid of the skooma I was carrying, I decided to add a new method of doing so that doesn't involve redistributing it or leaving it somewhere for someone else to find.
  
  
-Can I configure the reward I get for turning in the drugs?
  
Yes. Open console and type (without the quotes) "set aaa\_GoldReward to x". x being the amount of gold you want. Moon sugar will always be half this value, whereas skooma is the whole value. Double-distilled skooma, redwater skooma, and sleeping tree sap are double this value. Alternatively, you may change the globalvariable in SSEEdit or the Creation Kit if you have the know-how in order to permanently change the value. Otherwise, you will need to type this command every new playthrough.
  
  
-Why no MCM?
  
I just didn't feel like making one for a mod this small.
  
  
-Is this compatible with [Skyrim on Skooma](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80975)?
  
Yes.
  
  
-Any requirements?
  
Fingers with which you can press the keys/buttons to navigate dialogue. Otherwise, no.
  
  
-Can you add Balmora Blue to the list?
  
It would break a major Thieves Guild quest if you could turn that in to the guards. Also, why would you be turning it in if you're that far into the Thieves Guild?
  
  
-Esl-flagged?
  
Yes.
