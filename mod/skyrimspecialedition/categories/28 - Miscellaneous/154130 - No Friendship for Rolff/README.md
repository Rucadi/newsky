It's weird that Rolff regards the player as a friend after the player beats him up. We tell Rolff that we don't like his attitude and punch his face in for it, but he refuses to change his ways. Why would we suddenly be friends? This mod rectifies that by allowing the player to make it clear that you are not his friend via a new dialogue option that appears after you kick his ass.
  
  
**FAQ**
  
  
Why did I make this mod?
  
  
Because fuck racists. Rolff decides on his own that you're buddies all of the sudden after punching his teeth in. He will even go as far as to invite himself to your wedding after your brawl. Sure, maybe he respects your strength, but that is no reason to crash your wedding and add you to his will. It's also criminal that Bethesda made him essential.
  
  
How exactly does this mod work?
  
  
When you finish your brawl with Rolff, he is given the relationship rank of 1, meaning "friend." Prior to the brawl, his relationship rank is 0, meaning "acquaintance" (the default relationship rank). My mod adds a dialogue option that appears when the relationship rank is 1. Using this dialogue option will set his relationship rank to -1, meaning "rival," and remove his essential flag. That's all there is to it: just a quick and lightweight one-time script.
  
  
Can I add this mid-save?
  
  
Yes. The mod will just check for Rolff's relationship rank, so it will still work even if you've already done the fight.
  
  
Any incompatibilities?
  
  
Nope, should work with anything. The dialogue is contained within its own quest, and the changes to relationship rank and protection are handled via script. No vanilla records were altered in the making of this mod.
  
  
Can you make a version without the essential status change?
  
  
No
  
  
Esl-Flagged?
  
  
Yes
