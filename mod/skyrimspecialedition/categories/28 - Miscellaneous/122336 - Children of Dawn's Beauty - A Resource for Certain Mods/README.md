This mod is not for player characters and will have no effect if you install it without my mods.
  
  
I did not put this mod together in a traditional way: there are no Complexion records or custom head parts assigned to the new skin/teeth textures, etc. I typically just reassigned the textures via NifSkope, so I can avoid editing Race records.
  
  
This is a resource you need for my following mods:
  

  
* [Children of the Ash](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/122165)﻿
[Children of the First](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/122167)﻿
  
* [Children of the Green](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/122164)﻿

  
 This mod contains all the custom skin textures I edited for humanoids, as well as some other stuff I commonly use between the mods (see **Credits** section.)
  
  
I made this because I've never liked how all ages of Mer NPCs use the same textures, with only a wrinkle texture overlay on their faces. Of course, there are some mods that add the Elder human race skin textures to old elf NPCs, which helps, but I don't like that the skin lacks the prominent elven brow ridge that TES elves have.
  
  
 This mod's version of elderly elf skin has both wrinkles and brow ridges. Additionally, I have made a less wrinkled "middle-aged" skin as a midway point between "elderly" and "mature" (no prominent wrinkles, but keeps the sharp face structure and ridge.) Lastly, there is the "young" age group, which is similar to mature except with slightly rounder face features. Palm skin is lightened for elves, as, in real life, people with more pigmented skin have lighter palms and soles of their feet, due to a lack of melanin in those areas.
  
  
There are also a variety of complexion textures to add some more visual distinction.
  
  
[size=3]This series of mods tries to stay somewhat in line with Skyrim's style, while adding new visuals inspired by lore from the whole
  
 franchise.

[/size]**How I choose what kind of textures to assign NPCs:**
  
1. **Voice type** - NPCs with the 'Young, Eager' voice types get Young skin types; NPCS with 'Old' voice types get Elderly skin.
  
2. **Default complexions**- for NPCs with all other voice types, I look at the complexions they were originally assigned: those with 'Age40' or 'Age50' style complexions (including Rough variants) get Middle-Aged skin.
  
3. **Familial relationships** - for consistency's sake, I make sure that parents look older than their children.
  
4. **Occupation** - laborers and warriors get Strong body textures; all else just get regular Smooth muscle tones.

**Requirements**
  

  
* [BEES](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441) ﻿(if using an old version of Skyrim)

  
**Contents**
  
  
**Body Textures for NPCs**
  
Has multiple variants of skin textures, based on age and fitness.
  
  
There are options for Vanilla, CBBE, UNP, and Himbo bodies (no male genitals included.) Resolution options include 4k (torso only,) 2k, and 1k.
  
**Please note:** Vanilla male body textures are meant to be used with feet mesh replacers, like the one included in Tempered Skin for Males. Otherwise, the NPCs will have messed up feet textures.
  
  
**There are a few age categories:**

  
* Young- this age category does not have wrinkles
Middle-Aged- has light wrinkles and stretch marks.
  
* Elderly- wrinkled, with stretch marks and liver spots.

  
**There are two levels of muscle definition normal maps:**
  
  

  
* Average- this is a texture set with minimal muscle sculpting. This is the most-used texture.

  
* Strong- this is a texture set with more sculpted muscles, but not unrealistically so. This is used by laborers (farmers, miners, etc.) and warriors in my mods.

  
**Face Textures**
  
Normal maps are NOT contained in the main resource file, but they are included in the mod I made for each race.
  
  
The diffuse maps included with this mod are:
  
  
**Face Complexions**
  
I included a few complexions from other mods, and also transformed/edited a few to cover what I think are some gaps in Skyrim's Vanilla complexions.
  
  
**Teeth Textures**
  
I used Miggylove's Natural Teeth as a base to add some variety to NPC teeth.
  
  
**High Poly Heads**
  
Only includes the animation files from High Poly Heads in a custom file, to ensure that the NPC facegen in my mods works without issue on any setup. In case of clipping, you may need to install Expressive FaceGen Morphs and both Expressive Facial Animation files (Male and Female.)
  
**Optional Files**
  
**Non-Compacted Plugin**
  
This file will NOT be updated and will NOT work with any of my main files. Only useful for LE ports.
