You can barter with these priests each day from 7 am to 9 pm, as long as they're inside at their respective temples, except for Nura Snow-Shod (as there is no Temple of Talos in Riften) and the priestesses at the Temple of Dibella (as they have multiple interior cells.)
  
  
The vendors of these priests are affected by the Master Merchant perk (+ 1000 gold to all vendors), as well as the Investor Perk. The latter will open dialogue to invest in their temple.
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
  
Cell edits are kept at a minimum, using a dummy cell for the vendor containers.
  
  
To use this mod you need to main file + one of the files to distribute the vendor factions to the actual priests. There are 2 options:
  
  

  
* Without SPID: done through an ESP, less compatible with mods that edit the same NPCs.
With SPID: using SPID. More compatible, but requires SPID.
  

  
You need one of them, otherwise the priests won't sell anything.
  
  
I've also added a patch for [USSEP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266).
  
  
[Pilgrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54099) already has something similar, so you won't need my mod in case you're using that.
  
  
**FAQ**
  
  
Q: ESPFE?
  
A: Yes.
  
  
Q: Does installing/updating/uninstalling on an existing save work?
  
A: As far as I know, it should. However, it's good practice to keep a backup save prior to doing this, just in case.
  
  
Q: Is this compatible with <insert mod>?
  
A: I don't know by heart. You might need to check yourself.
  
  
Q: Will you make a patch for <insert mod>?
  
A: Only if it's a mod I use myself or plan on using, I have enough time and I actually like the idea. Otherwise, feel free to do it yourself. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: I have a suggestion to improve the mod. Can you do it?
  
A: Maybe, if I have time and I like the idea, I'll consider it.
  
  
Q: Will you port this to <insert platform>?
  
A: No, I myself only support the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If someone else wants to port it, feel free. (see permission) If you decide to port it, you yourself take full responsibility to offer support to said port. I will not provide no support for any ports by third parties.
  
  
Q: I use a ported version of this mod on <insert platform> and I have a problem. Can you help?
  
A: I don't provide any support for third party ports on other platforms than the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If you have issues, you should adress the person that ported it.
  
  
Q: Does this work on Skyrim 1.6+, aka "Anniversary Edition"?
  
A: Yes, it should.
  
  
Q: Why don't your mods use MCMs and instead use this janky console command system to set globals?
  
A: I am not a fan of MCMs. You can set the globals by making a patch in xEdit. I have no plans of changing this. If you want to add an MCM, feel free. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: Why don't you use FOMODs?
  
A: That would require reuploading the entire mod, in question, even if I only make a small change. My internet is limited and reuploading the files each time will take a huge chunk of my monthly volume.
