**Wyrmstooth Paper Map for FWMF by Limon**
  
It's a paper map for [Wyrmstooth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45565) mod by [Jonx0r](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/83227138). Hope it will help you to navigate here and will add little bit of immersion. Mod continues series of paper maps for a [Flat World Map Framework (FWMF)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29932).
  
  
Some things to know about this map:

  
* Best FWMF package for this map is  "FWMF for Fantasy Paper Maps", it renders colors closest to original.
Map texture is 8K, plugin flagged as ESL.
  
* Map drawn by [Limon](https://www.instagram.com/acbasaran/)﻿ artist, I only compiled mesh and made traced image for outlining.
Unlike Wyrmstooth map from [Duncan's package](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55025)﻿, map is up-to-date geo wise, with Witch's Crag island. It is also more accurate.

Flat World Map Framework uses mainly vertical look at map, but allows limited inclination and rotation with held right button as well.
  
MCM in FOMOD and config INI file with comments included in FWMF allows to tune map control (keyboard, mouse and gamepad), possible angles and blur.
  
  
**Requirements**

  
* [FWMF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29932)
[Wyrmstooth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45565)﻿
  

  
**Installation**
  
The archive is mod manager compatible.
  
  
Install [size=3][FWMF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29932) FOMOD first (Fantasy Paper Maps package preferable). Make sure FMWF is the last in plugins list (only weather fixes or FWMF various patches may be lower), then install this mod normally and place it last in mod order.
  
  
[/size]FWMF FOMOD includes an option to mark Wyrmstooth worldspace whitelisted for map markers flattening, you don't need to do anything additionally if you picked "all" on this FOMOD step. If you curate your own Flat Map Markers config, you need this block included for this map:
  
  
> {
>   
>  "name": "Wyrmstooth",
>   
>  "editorID": "WyrmstoothWorld",
>   
>  "markerHeight": 180000,
>   
>  "enabled": true
>   
>  },

  
**Compatibility**
  
[size=3]SE/AE/GOG compatible (1.6.1130 including), but be sure to pick your exact Skyrim version during FWMF FOMOD installation (first option for 1.6.1130).
  
Not compatible with map mods except [FMWF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29932).
  
  
[/size]**Recommended Mods**
  
[Atlas Map Markers - Updated with MCM](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24104)﻿ works perfect and smaller markers make map more readable. Just be sure to put Atlas' .esp before FWMF in load order.
  
  
Get along with most UI overhauls.
  
  
**Known Issues**
  
None so far.
  
  
**For mapmakers, modders and modlist authors**
  
If you would like to create your own paper-like maps for Skyrim, its DLCs and add-ons, you just need to ask me in Discord - it is simpler than it seems. Some maps are technically ready for drawing already, for others I will provide detailed instructions what to do.
  
  
Modlist authors who wish to add FWMF maps to their lists and have requests to tune/fix some things, feel free to PM me, I will try to help  the best I can.
