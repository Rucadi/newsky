**Forgotten Vale Paper Map for FWMF**

  
It is a first Forgotten Vale map available in the game as well as first flat isometric one. Hope it will help you to navigate here and will add little bit of immersion. Mod continues series of paper maps for a [Flat World Map Framework (FWMF)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29932).

Flat World Map Framework uses mainly vertical look at map, but allows limited inclination and rotation with held right button as well.
  
INI file with comments included in FWMF allows to tune map control (keyboard, mouse and gamepad), possible angles and blur.
  
  
**Requirements**

  
* [FWMF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29932)﻿

  
**Installation**
  
[size=3]The archive is mod manager compatible.
  
  
Install [size=3][FWMF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29932) FOMOD first (Fantasy Paper Maps package preferable). Make sure FMWF is the last in plugins list (only weather fixes or FWMF various patches may be lower), then install this mod normally and place it last in mod order.
  
  
[/size]Make sure Flat Map Markers config file (FlatMapMarkersSSE.json) has this part:
  
  
*> },
>   
>  {
>   
>  "name": "Forgotten Vale",
>   
>  "editorID": "DLC01FalmerValley",
>   
>  "markerHeight": 180000,
>   
>  "enabled": true
>   
>  },* [/size]
  
**Compatibility**
  
[size=3]Compatible - Skyrim SE/AE/GOG (1.6.640 including), but be sure to pick your exact Skyrim version during FWMF FOMOD installation.
  
Soft compatibility - [Forgotten Vale Map Markers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74537)﻿ (there will be 2 different "To Skyrim" markers), if that is an issue use this [patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/79536).
  
Not compatible - any map mods except [FMWF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29932).
  
  
[/size]**Recommended Mods**
  
[Atlas Map Markers - Updated with MCM](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24104)﻿ works perfect and smaller markers make map more readable. Just be sure to put Atlas' .esp before FWMF in load order.
  
  
Get along with most UI overhauls. [Dear Diary UI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23010)﻿ and its skins are highly recommended.
  
  
**Known Issues**
  
None so far.
