# Quest Journal Fix for SkyUI
- Author: Jelidity - Mopop
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/108618
This mod patches the quest\_journal.swf file such that the difficulty persists when you change it, it's been patched across most if not all skin mods for SkyUI.
  
  
On top of that, the original [Persistence Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106418)﻿ only worked on 1.6.1130 and using the file in any version prior to that would result in a crash, now that's been fixed due to the quest\_journal.swf file detecting your Skyrim version and patching it dynamically, this second thing is more of a modders resource so that all skin mods only need one file when they update.
