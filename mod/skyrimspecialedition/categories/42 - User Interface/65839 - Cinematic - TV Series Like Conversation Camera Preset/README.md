The conversation cameras in films and tv shows have an unique angle that i like and can not find it on most video games. With this mod, i have tried to replicate that. 
  
Notice how you can see the shoulder of the non-talking character in this below shot, taken from a famous Turkish TV series called Magnificent Century

**(BEFORE) Vanilla Skyrim Conversation Angle
  
Notice how barebones it is, both in first person and third person camera, the results are unaltered and you are stuck with what you had just before the conversation, often causing NPCs to get between you and the speaking character**![](https://images.sftcdn.net/images/t_app-cover-l,f_auto/p/9cbf1428-c54e-413b-a3d4-650d9ed355ad/611551707/improved-follower-dialogue-lydia-screenshot.jpeg)
  
**(AFTER)

**You'll also achieve a much improved version when you initiate dialogues on first person camera as well.**
  
  
Requires [Alternate Conversation Camera mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21220) by [NasGorTelorCeplok](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/60861451). 
  
  
I created this mod for the [Immersive & Adult collection](https://next.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/collections/xxsqm4) i have curated and figured that everyone can use it. So here it is.
  
Camera is always fixed on the NPC rather than the player, zoom ratio has been tweaked (less zoom), camera focuses more slowly to the target than the default. Somewhat greater field of view. You see your characters shoulder slightly.
  
  
Install via vortex or your favourite mod manager or manually.
  
Does not take a plugin / .esp spot (yay!)
  
Let this overwrite the alternate conversation camera mod.
  
  
Sovngarde font is used on the screenshots. You do not need it. This works without any font mods.
