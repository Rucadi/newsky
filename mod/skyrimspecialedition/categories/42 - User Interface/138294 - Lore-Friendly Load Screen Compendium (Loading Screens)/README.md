**Lore-Friendly Load Screen Compendium**
  
  

The Lore-Friendly Load Screen Compendium [LLSC] features **440 new loading screens** sourced from the Elder Scrolls Legends, the Elder Scrolls Online, Skyrim concept art, and independent artists (with express permission: see credit.txt).

Every image was cleaned of artifacts and carefully upscaled (when necessary), combining multiple upscaling methods using Topaz Gigapixel and Photoshop. I also adjusted the colors, tone, and contrast of each before manually cropping them **for 16:9, 16:10, and 21:9 displays** **\*** to ensure no important content is cut off. Additionally, each screen's text was written based on information provided on the [Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Main_Page), which was an indispensable asset in making this mod. ﻿For more details, see the FAQ in the Posts tab.

This isn't a new idea by any means, but I sought to improve upon what is already available on the Nexus for the highest possible quality and variety. Many of the images haven't been featured in ANY other mods and finding high quality versions of the images themselves required extensive searching. The goal was to have as many of the vanilla load screens represented as I could find high quality images for, as well as add new lore-friendly content.

**\*** The 21:9 ratio version was tested on 3440 x 1440 resolution (which is the most common), but the textures themselves were cropped for other 21:9 resolutions as well, so it should work for them all. Let me know of any issues!

**Required and Recommended**
  
  

* LLSC has NO requirements as of v1.2.0. The following are optional if you want to block any and all loading screens added by other mods.
Run the [Synthesis](https://github.com/Mutagen-Modding/Synthesis) patcher for your unique modlist. There is a link to the repository in the FAQ in the Posts sections here. Do not activate my ESP until after the patch is generated.
  
* Preferred: [Display Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34705) includes a load screen filter in its INI under [Miscellaneous]. Add the following:[list]

  ```
  LoadScreenFilter=true
    
  LoadScreenAllow=LoadScreenCompendium.esp
    
  LoadScreenBlock=All
  ```

  
[\*] What you see in game may vary depending on what ENB and complementary mods are used. I highly recommend using [Improved Loading Screen Colors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61712), as well as a mod to remove the smoke fx, such as [Loading Screen Smoke Removed](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4634) or [Menu and Load Smoke Removed for ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51986).
  
[\*] Nordic UI users must select "No Empty Background" for Loading Screens in the Nordic UI FOMOD.
  
[\*] Widescreen users should be sure to grab the [Complete Widescreen Fix for Vanilla and SkyUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1778)[/list]

**Included Content**
  
  

There are 5 main versions, available for 16:9, 16:10, and 21:9 displays in 2K and 4K. The **All-Inclusive** version includes Creation Club content and some non-vanilla content **\***, such as daedric creatures or teleportation magic (included in many popular magic mods). If you're not interested in any extra content, there is a **Vanilla-Only** option available, as well as an option for only **Creation Club Additions**. The **Author's Cut** version is based on All-Inclusive - including some non-vanilla content - and features 350 (around the same as vanilla) of the highest quality screens. There is also a **Minimal** version with only 125 screens for those looking to save resources. A full rundown of content per version can be found [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/9524).

**\*** Please note that no outside mods are required for these non-vanilla screens to work, so you can use them even if you don't have a mod that adds scamps, for example, if you just want the added lore.
  

The **All-Inclusive version** includes 440 loading screens:[list]* 346 from the Elder Scrolls Legends
46 from the Elder Scrolls Online
  
* 31 from Skyrim Concept Art
17 from Independent Artists

Here are some samples of the text included, some inspired by [Immersive Load Screen Message Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67293) (with edits):
> The Stormcloaks view the banning of Talos worship as an affront to Nord culture, while the Imperials believe Skyrim must honor the laws of the Empire that Tiber Septim himself built.

> The wintry reaches of northern Skyrim are haunted by swift elemental spirits known as ice wraiths. Their transparency and icy glow make them difficult to see or hit, leaping from the snow as if conjured from the frost itself.

> Skyrim's harsh wilderness and unrelenting cold may prove to be great adversaries to the ill-prepared. Only the hardiest explorers can survive her treacherous beauty, and stave off hunger and fatigue.
