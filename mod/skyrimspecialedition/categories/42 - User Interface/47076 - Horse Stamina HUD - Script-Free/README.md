# Horse Stamina HUD - Script-Free

The original idea for this mod came from [Horse Stamina Widget](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/53546) by just ([SSE port](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47032)).
  
  
Normally, when you are mounted, the game will hide your stamina meter. With this mod, the stamina meter will stay visible, but instead of showing your own character's stamina, it will show the stamina of your mount.
  
  
This doesn't use any new widgets, so it should be compatible with whatever HUD mods you are using.
