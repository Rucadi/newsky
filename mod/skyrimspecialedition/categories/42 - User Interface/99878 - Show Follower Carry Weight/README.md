**Description**
  

  
* Show follower's current carry weight in trading menu.
Limitations:
  
[list]* Followers with perks that make certain items weightless will have inaccurate carryweights (off by a few units).
There is vanilla bug where the carry weight actor value for the follower will not update immediately if you give them enchanted items which boost carry weight. This is not a display bug but rather an actor value bug, as the game will prevent you from trading above the old limit. It will be accurately updated after you exit the trading window and re-open it.
