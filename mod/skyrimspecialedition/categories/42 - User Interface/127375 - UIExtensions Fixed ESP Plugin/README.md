# UIExtensions Fixed ESP Plugin
- Author: Expired - original mod
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

This fixed ESP should do at least two things:
  

  
1. Fixes where the game randomly refuses to load with UIExtensions enabled even through mod managers on v1170 (happened to me a couple of times).
As well as make UIExtensions usable in case you use Bethesda's own in-game mod manager.
  

  
  
For AddItemMenu compatibility with SE/AE - 1130/1170: please read the comments sections of that mod - a solution is available there.

To admins: as there was no info on permissions for the original mod, i assume this patched esp would be fine (as the original is still required). Should the author of UIExtension wish for this to be deleted - will be taken down ASAP.
