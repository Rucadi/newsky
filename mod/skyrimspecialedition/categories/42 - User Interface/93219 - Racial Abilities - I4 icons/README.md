**You only need my plugin when playing with Vanilla races, Morningstar, Ancient Falmer or Timelost Dwemer.**
  
Survival Mode is covered in a separate plugin. You need it no matter what overhaul you use.
  
[Conner's Survival Mode](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19152) doesn't edit any of the racial abilities. Choose the basic version of Survival Mode in the installer while using it. 
  
If your preferred overhaul is not supported, let me know and I will make a patch for it.

Thank you, darkequine!
  
  
Short explanation of the meaning/source of the icons:
  
Altmer - a [Thalmor](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Thalmor) symbol
  
Argonian - a [Hist](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Hist) tree
  
Bosmer - a symbol of the [Green Pact](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Green_Pact)
  
Breton - a triquetra, as mentioned in [this](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Crafting_Motif_93:_Ancestral_Breton_Style) book and on some tattoos in ESO
  
Dunmer - a symbol of [Azura](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Azura)
  
Imperial - a symbol of the [Empire](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Empire)
  
Khajiit - [Masser](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Masser) and [Secunda](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Secunda), the two moons, as they are closely related to their [morphology](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Khajiit#Morphology)
  
Nord - a dragon, same symbol they use in ESO
  
Orsimer - anvil and a hammer, same symbol they use in ESO
  
Redguard - a shield and 3 scimitars, same symbol they use in ESO
  
  
I'm not exactly satisfied with Nord and Orsimer symbols, but don't have any better ideas. If you have any suggestions, I will gladly hear them out.
  
  
Slight issue for Vanilla and Vanilla + USSEP users ONLY
  
The plugin modifies some of races, but doesn't change how they function. The abilites are literally copy-pasted, because I had to give them unique FormIDs. Until I figure out how to assign an icon based on the source of an effect, it has to stay this way. But it's a cosmetic change only, so load my mod before anything that touches the races and it should be fine, the worst that could happen is an icon will be missing.
  
  
[Inventory Interface Information Injector](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85702) is required.
