This is QoL type mod. Adds [MCM Helper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53000) support for [Trade and Barter](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23081/) by [kryptopyr](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/4291352). Saves settings as you change them, automatically loads settings on startup or game load, imports settings from an existing save, so you don't have to spend time in MCM again with each game. Localization support. No plugin.
  
  
USAGE:
  
1. Install [Trade and Barter](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23081/) in version: 2.2.
  
2. Install loader.
  
3. Configure "Trade & Barter" in MCM (Settings will be imported automatically from an existing save).
  
4. Every game will automatically load user settings.
  
  
Features:
  

  
* Very easy to use - automatically saves and loads settings, no user interaction required.
Fast - settings are loaded directly at script initialization without any additional steps.
  
* Automatically imports settings from an existing game (the settings will be imported after loading the game, or if the base mod does not use functions OnGameReload/OnUpdate after opening MCM).
Localization support.
  
* Ability to set delay in seconds for automatic loading.
Ability to enable loading settings when reloading the game.
  
* Ability to disable automatic loading.
Ability to load settings manually.
  
* Ability to reset all settings.

  
  
All MCM Helper-based loaders automatically save and load settings. You don't have to do anything in this regard.

> **FAQ**
>   
>   
> **The main mod has been updated, does your mod need an update?**
>   
> If the MCM menu file has changed, yes.
>   
>   
> **Main mod updated and MCM changed, when will you update your mod?**
>   
> As soon as possible, if I forget, just send me a PM.
>   
>   
> **Is your mod compatible with mod X?**
>   
> Probably yes, if MCM has not been changed. Most "Settings Loaders" mods just change the MCM. If you are unsure, please ask me.
>   
>   
> **Will you combine all your mods into one?**
>   
> No, this will drastically increase my mod management time, make bug fixes, version update, and the description section a mess. These mods do not take plugin slots. I will create an AIO installer in the future, so installation will be very easy.
>   
>   
> **MCM doesn't show up.**
>   
>
>   
> * This can often be resolved by opening the command console and typing: **setstage SKI\_ConfigManagerInstance 1**
> You can also install [Jaxonz MCM Kicker SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36801).
>   
> * Or just use [Menu Maid 2 - MCM manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67556) (this manager automatically finds and adds all MCMs).
>
>   
> **Why MCM is empty?**
>   
> You need to install MCM Helper for your version of the game. Make sure you don't mix mods for SE(1.5.97) with the AE(1.6.+) version.
>   
>   
> **But I already have the MCM Helper in the correct version for my game! MCM is still empty!**
>   
>
>   
> * Just save the game and load it.
> If you are using WryeBash make sure the installer has added the json files.
>   
>
>   
> **Settings do not load or a specific option does not load.**
>   
> If you have a lot of mods with scripts, the engine can't keep up. Set a delay for loading settings in the "Maintenance" tab.
>   
>   
> **Can I install the loader midgame?**
>   
> Yes, all settings from MCM will be imported automatically. Depending on how the base mod was created, the settings will be imported after loading the game, or if the base mod does not use functions OnGameReload/OnUpdate after opening MCM.
