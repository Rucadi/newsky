﻿**Description**
  
SKSE plugin that removes Bethesda's widescreen implementation from version 1.6.1130+.
  
This can fix issues with swfs that contain widescreen support, removing the need for any unsquish fixes. For example, you'll no longer need to unsquish [Edge UI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/130983)﻿ or any other Dear Diary Dark Mode based mod.
  
Note: You still need swfs that work for your resolution when using this mod. Skyrim will behave like versions **lower than 1.6.1130** regarding **widescreen** and **UI scaling** with this mod installed.
  
  
  
[size=4]**Compatibility**
  
AE: 1.6.1130, 1.6.1170, 1.6.1179
  
Make sure you don't have any unsquishing fixes active when using this mod.
  
  
The following mods are certain to cause issues with menus:
  
- [Remove All Caps from Untarnished UI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/127168)
