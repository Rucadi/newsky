Skyrim VR version can be found [HERE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59816/). Thanks to [alandtse](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/95120793)﻿.
  
  
With this mod you will be able to move around in dialogue menus. It also unlocks the camera rotation so you'll be able to look around in any direction. Dialogue menus will close automatically if you move too far away from the speaker.
  
  
The mod comes with an .ini file that allows you to configure some of its features, like the auto-closing distance.
  
Version 2.1 and newer will unlock even more controls if configured in the .ini.
  
  
**Compatibility:**If using [Skyrim Souls RE - Updated](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27859), make sure you're using the version 2.0.0 or newer. Older versions will conflict with this mod.
  
May conflict with mods that disable or remap the dpad buttons in menus on controllers.
  
Should be compatible with pretty much anything else.
