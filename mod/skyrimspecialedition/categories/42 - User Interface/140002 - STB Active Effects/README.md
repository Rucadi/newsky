 **﻿﻿STB Active Effects adds a widget, which allows you to customize position, size and opacity of the active                    effects HUD:**

 **﻿In version 1.1, time format settings have been added by request:
  
  

  
* HH:MM:SS (displays time in a fixed hours:minutes:seconds format, e.g. 02:45:10)
Auto HH:MM:SS / MM:SS (automatically switches formats based on remaining time: more than an hour left → HH:MM:SS; less than an hour → MM:SS)
  
* MM:SS (up to 99 min) (always shows minutes and seconds, capped at 99 minutes)
MM:SS (no limit) (same minutes:seconds format, but without a 99-minute cap)
  

  
 ﻿And you can also customize the spacing between effects**

 **﻿In version 1.2, imgui added the ability to group effects by source: food, potion, alcohol, scrolls.
  
  
 ﻿When the corresponding parameter is enabled:
  
  

  
* [size=4][b]a single shared icon is created for each type.**
  
**instead of showing magnitude, the number of effects is displayed.**
  
- **the effect icon is replaced with the source icon.**
**the duration of the shortest effect is shown.**

 **INI file is located at STB Active Effects\SKSE\Plugins and contains the following sections:
  
  
 ﻿[Settings]
  

  
* [size=4][b]OpenMenu - the assigned key shows and hides the menu (default END).**
  
**DebugEffects - helps with patching.**
  
 ﻿[Main]
  

  
* **Contains core information and your settings. No manual edits, use in-game menu instead.**

 ﻿[Default]
  

  
* **Restore point. Do not change.**

  
 ﻿If you are using [STB Widgets](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/136148?tab=description)﻿, update it to version 1.7 or higher. The new section will automatically
  
 appear in the Widget's menu, and "menu" key from that mod will be used instead.
