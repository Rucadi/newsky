# Compass Navigation Overhaul
- Author: alexsylex
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

The compass in Skyrim is... well... a bit underwhelming. For each type of marker, they look the same. So, for example, when you have several quests enabled, it becomes impossible to know what quest are you facing just by looking at the compass. You find yourself again opening the map, trying to guess which one of them is the match. Well, no more!
  
  

Currently on the works...

Compass Navigation Overhaul aims to improve the game experience by adding some useful information to those markers, such as the name of the marker and distance.

The angle to start/stop showing the details is configurable
  
Name of the markers will be shown in **your** game language

  
In addition to the distance, a height-difference indicator is shown. For example, it can be useful to consider your route when approaching a cliff. This one was inspired by the game *Assassin's Creed* :)

Distance units can be changed between **feets** and **meters**The indicator appears when the height difference is more than 3 floors

  
You can customize the behavior of quest marker names, choosing between the **objective** or the **location/character** they point to.
  
 When you face a quest marker, the current objectives for that quest will appear in a **quest-list widget**. The less time in menus the better!

﻿The position and height of the list and delay to show can be configured

  
This mod also offer the option to configure whether to show or hide the following markers in the compass:
  

  
* **Undiscovered** locations. Other mods remove **ALL** the **unvisited** locations, while this one only the undiscovered ones. If they are unlocked in the map, then you know them, and they should appear in your compass, right?
**Enemies**, because you can remember places, but you are not omniscient to sense people through walls. Or yes? You are the dragonborn... Anyways, I'll leave the option there for you.
  
* **Markers behind doors** can be shown in the compass when you are outside.

Open Cities was not installed for this demo, trust me

  
As an option, instead of hiding the undiscovered locations, there are several options to customize the markers for them. You can have unvisited locations with their marker and undiscovered locations with a "?" marker. The best of both worlds ;)
  
  
The compass can be edited to match the theme you want. In the gif below you see the Nordic UI skin for this mod, **available in the Files tab**!

Nordic UI skin in action + "?" undiscovered markers

  
From version 2.0.2, [CoMAP - Common Marker Addon Project](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56123) and [Beyond Skyrim - Bruma SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10917) are supported!
  
Bruma support needs that you install CoMAP to work.

Markers in Bruma thanks to CoMAP compatibility!

  
  
The **mod options** can be configured from the **INI file**. In the future I will add an MCM menu to ease things up :)
  
  
If you read up to this point, you may be interested on giving it a try in your modlist. So... back to Skyrim again?
