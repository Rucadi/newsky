**You do not need my plugin when using a patch for one of the overhauls.**
  
**Slight issue for Vanilla and Vanilla + USSEP users ONLY**The plugin modifies the ability of the Atronach Stone, but doesn't change how it functions. The ability is literally copy-pasted, because I had to give it a unique FormID. Until I figure out how to assign an icon based on the source of an effect, it has to stay this way. But it's a cosmetic change only, so load my mod before anything that touches the Stone and it should be fine, the worst that could happen is an icon will be missing.
  
  
[Inventory Interface Information Injector](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85702) is required.
