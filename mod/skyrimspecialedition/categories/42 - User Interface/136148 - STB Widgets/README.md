 ﻿**Widgets have a flexible configuration structure. You can turn off and move each widget where you need it, if you wish.**
  
 ﻿
  
 **There are three sections in the ini mod:**
  
  

  
* **﻿**Keys (in this section you can configure the menu call key and hide key, by default END/F11. Find the key you need on the [website](https://ck.uesp.net/wiki/Input_Script)﻿ and enter its number)
Main (contains information about all widget settings, always works)
  
* Default (сontains information about all widget settings, but is used when resetting settings)

**The ini file is located at the path****"STB Widgets\SKSE\Plugins\STB\_Widgets.ini"
  
  
 ﻿﻿Also in the ImGui menu there is a window through which you can increase the borders of the movement strips along ﻿ ﻿   
  
       the X and Y. It ﻿is used for non-standard monitors.

 ﻿﻿By default, there will be two presets available for 16x9 and 21x9 screens. This mod does not affect health/stamina/mana ﻿﻿ ﻿bars in any way, ﻿so we offer two optional presets for TrueHud and Skyhud. In the preset for TrueHud, numbers were added to                     ﻿﻿the﻿﻿ stripes.
