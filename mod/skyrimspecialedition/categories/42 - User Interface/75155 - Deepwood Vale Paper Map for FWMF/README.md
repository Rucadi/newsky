**﻿[b][color=#b6d7a8]Deepwood Vale Paper Map for FWMF**

﻿

[/color][/b]It is a first paper map for Deepwood Vale area. Made in the same isometric way as Forgotten Vale and Soul Cairn paper maps for FWMF. Hope it will help you to navigate here and will add little bit of immersion. Mod continues series of paper maps for a [Flat World Map Framework (FWMF)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29932).
  
  
Some things to know about this map:

  
* Part of worldspace available for player and worth mapping is tiny comparing to whole worldspace. That leads to very sensitive scrolling in map menu, same as with Markarth map.
I simplified some complex structures and perspective may have flaws, but overall map is precise.
  
* "To Skyrim" global marker will be added later (if there will be a need).
There is a little tribute to passed away modder, Olivier Doorenbos. Kudos to those who remember the guy.
  
* Best FWMF package for this map is  "FWMF for Fantasy Paper Maps", it renders colors closest to original.

Flat World Map Framework uses mainly vertical look at map, but allows limited inclination and rotation with held right button as well.
  
INI file with comments included in FWMF allows to tune map control (keyboard, mouse and gamepad), possible angles and blur.
  
  
**Requirements**

  
* [FWMF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29932)﻿

  
**Installation**
  
The archive is mod manager compatible.
  
  
Install [size=3][FWMF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29932) FOMOD first (Fantasy Paper Maps package preferable). Make sure FMWF is the last in plugins list (only weather fixes or FWMF various patches may be lower), then install this mod normally and place it last in mod order.
  
  
[/size]Make sure Flat Map Markers config file (FlatMapMarkersSSE.json) has this part:
  
  
> *},
>   
>  {
>   
>  "name": "Deepwood Vale",
>   
>  "editorID": "DeepwoodRedoubtWorld",
>   
>  "markerHeight": 180000,
>   
>  "enabled": true
>   
>  }*

  
**Compatibility**
  
Using any map mods other than FWMF with it may cause issues.
  
  
SE/AE/GOG compatible (1.6.640 including), but be sure to pick your exact Skyrim version during FWMF FOMOD installation.
  
  
**Recommended Mods**
  
[Atlas Map Markers - Updated with MCM](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24104)﻿ works perfect and smaller markers make map more readable. Just be sure to put Atlas' .esp before FWMF in load order.
  
  
Get along with most UI overhauls. [Dear Diary UI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23010)﻿ and its skins are highly recommended.
  
  
**Known Issues**
  
None so far.

**Future Plans**
  
Global markers to/from Deepwood Vale ~~and a proper background.~~
  
  
**For mapmakers, modders and modlist authors**If you would like to create your own paper-like maps for Skyrim, its DLCs and add-ons, you just need to ask me in Discord - it is simpler than it seems. Some maps are technically ready for drawing already, for others I will provide detailed instructions what to do.
  
  
Modlist authors that wish to add FWMF maps to their lists and have requests to tune/fix some things, feel free to PM me, I will try to help  the best I can.
