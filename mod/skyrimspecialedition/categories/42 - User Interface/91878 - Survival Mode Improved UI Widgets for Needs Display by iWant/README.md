Its **Survival Mode Improved - Widgets**, not to be confused with **Survival Mode - Improved Widgets**
  
  
I made this because I hated how the survival mode ui stuff is tied to your health/magicka/stamina. 
  
Its hard to read.  The Widgets should in theory make it easier to tell when you are starting to get hungry/tired.
  
Its mainly for myself but since I made it might as well share it.
  
  
If people really want it I could make a standard CC Survival Mode one,
  
but to be honest Survival Mode Improved is better in every single way so if you can you should just use this one.
  
  
  
**Requires:**
  
**Anniversary Edition** (with CC Survival Mode enabled in the modlist)
  
**[Survival Mode Improved SKSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78244)**
  
[**iWant Widgets**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36457)
  
**[iWant Status Bars](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36460)**
  
  
Be careful when you install iWant Widgets/Status Bars, **READ CAREFULY AND DO NOT "CHECK" ANYTHING.** 
  
**If you see snowflakes and icons moving around you installed it wrong.
  
  
Encumbrance Widget** will work without Survival Mode CC or Survival Mode Improved.  It only references Skyrim.esm.  Feel free to use in a (mostly)vanilla playthrough.
  
All other Widgets require **Survival Mode Improved**.
  
  
**Installation:**
  
Just install it after iWant Widgets and iWant Status Bars.
  
Once you turn on Survival Mode, it requires a game load to start functioning.
  
  
**MCM:**Use the iWant Status Bars MCM, if you need more details go to the iWant Status Bars page.
  
  
**Uninstallation:**
  
Simply disable my widgets from the MCM of iWant Status Bars.  My mod does not add any global variables or edit anything in your current playthrough (all it does is read the global variables set by Survival Mode Improved).  If you really want to actually uninstall it, make sure you remove all my my Widgets through MCM, make a hard save (no quicksave), and then delete my widgets from your plugin order.  I would not recommend deleting iWant from a current play session (nor any mod for that matter) without restarting a new game.
