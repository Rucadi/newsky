**Lore-Friendly Main Menu Compendium**
  
  

The Lore-Friendly Main Menu Compendium [LMMC] features **40 main menu wallpapers** from the [Lore-Friendly Load Screen Compendium](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/138294) with support for 16:9, 16:10, and 21:9 aspect ratios. Includes an optional Main Menu Randomizer﻿ version. The images included were sourced from the Elder Scrolls Legends, the Elder Scrolls Online, Skyrim concept art, and independent artists (with permission - see credit.txt).

A reskin of Nordic UI's Start Menu based on my [Clean Start Menu patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/118936) for 1.6.1130+ is hosted in the Optional Files. This reskin centers the menu and adds a transparent, offset border to the game logo. This improves readability against white/light backgrounds, and can be used with other main menu wallpaper replacers. I can add support for the regular Nordic UI start menu if there's interest.
  
  
**Requirements**
  
  

Choose only one Main File* **Single Replacer** version has no requirements and supports Anniversary Edition (not required).
**Randomizer** version requires [Main Menu Randomizer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33574) and its requirements: [SKSE](https://skse.silverlock.org/) and [Address Library for SKSE Plugins](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444)
  
  
**Recommendations**
  
  

* Highly recommended to be used with [Improved Loading Screen Colors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61712), which also affects the main menu.
A mod to remove the smoke fx, such as [Loading Screen Smoke Removed](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4634) or [Menu and Load Smoke Removed for ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51986).
  
  

**A Note on Main Menu Randomizer:** Be sure to fully read Main Menu Randomizer's description BEFORE installing it.

  

This may seem simple, but many users have trouble uninstalling Main Menu Randomizer. As of v2.0, I packaged my files in a way that nothing elsewhere in your load order will be overwritten. Uninstallation should be as simple as deleting this mod, deleting Main Menu Randomizer, and clearing your overwrite if you use Mod Organizer 2 (I'm unsure of the process for Vortex).
