**[i] ﻿Description***[/left][/i]
  
Implements custom, handmade icons to replace the text for world interactions.
  
  
 ***﻿﻿Announcements*** 
  
[Dynamic String Distributor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/107676)promoted from beta to be the main patching method! See this [Article](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/7348) for details. Huge thanks to SkyHorizon3 for this awesome tool.
  
**'Knock' icon** support has been moved back to this mod via DSD patches. [Just Knock](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/103004) is still required but no longer needs separate plugins.
  
**Vampire 'Feed' Icon** now supported via [Just Bite!](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/122597) Currently, this uses DAK to support Scion, Sacrosanct, and Sacrilege.
  
**Custom Player Icons revamped!** All four racial icons are now available in Male and Female variants. As always, open to feedback on the designs. 
  
[QuickLoot IE 2.0 has released!](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120075?tab=description) The days of manual patches have ended. Huge thanks to MissCorruption and all update contributors for ending my suffering.
  
  
 ***﻿Version 2.5 released!***
  
There are some major changes from the [DSD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/107676?tab=description) beta and previous versions so please read the below carefully if you run into any issues.
  
Once again, huge thanks to SkyHorizon3 and Cutleast for their work on this utility.
  
Please show them some support if you enjoy this update.
  
  
 ***2.5 - ﻿Dynamic String Distributor Update***
  
Spoiler
  
**What is Dynamic String Distributor exactly?**It is, simply put, a convenient translation utility designed to dynamically replace game strings. Since my mod exclusively works with game strings, DSD can (functionally) power the entire mod. Version 2.5 fully integrates these patches into the main mod, replacing the majority of plugins.
  
  
**What does version 2.5 support through DSD?**
  
All basegame records for Activators and Flora will now display icons across all languages without patching. This means mods like [CACO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19924) or [Apothecary](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52130) will no longer revert OII's changes. Again, this holds for games in any language.
  
  
Additionally, around ~60 of the most popular mods have been fully patched (LOTD, Bruma, Vigilant, etc). DSD does require manual patches to be created once for every plugin - so support is not quite comparable to the Synthesis patcher *yet.* If you would like to contribute missing patches from your load order, I have created [a guide here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/7348) for doing so. Please reference it if you have any questions not covered in the description.
  
  
**What does version 2.5 not support?**
  
A few mods have had support dropped for various reasons; 
  

  
* SkyREM - MIA (or Activations) has sadly been deleted, so I have integrated icons that were exclusively in that patch into the main mod.
Just Do It no longer works with the new method (and is no longer recommended to use past game version 1.5.7 by its author).
  
* The PSDI patch with dynamic text replacement is gone - I could not prevent the lag in icon appearance. The Minimal patch remains available.

Anything else missing from the new installer is supported in the DSD patches with all of the new features available.
  
  
If you were using the NPC feature of SkyREM - MIA previously, please use the Obscurity feature from the awesome [NPC Names Distributor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73081)﻿.
  
  
**Do I need a new game for 2.5?**I would recommend it for various reasons. If you want to update mid-game, however, you can simply **install 2.5 after your old installation** - the majority of new features will work seamlessly. Disable SkyREM-MIA entirely in the MCM if using the new version.
  
  
Note: **skymojibase.esl** and **skymoji.esp** are still required - do not disable any plugins that are provided with 2.5 if you want full functionality. Future updates of DSD should make skymojibase.esl no longer required but please continue using it for now.
  
  
**What features does 2.5 add?**Color schemes are back from 0.99b (yes, it's been that long)! They are themed around various UI overhauls.
  
A fully-featured Immersive Prompts mode is available - with only icons for most interactions across the game.
  
2.4 added **new player icons** that will probably be new to most users updating to 2.5 as well!
  
  
**What languages does 2.5 support?**Basic functionality is available in all languages, but there is a smidge of translation (~30 terms total) required for the new patches. See [the patch guide](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/7348) for details.
  
I will probably upload basic MTL translations in the near future if nobody gets around to it.
  
  
 ***﻿Synthesis patcher (for versions 2.4 and lower)*** Spoiler
  
Thanks to [iXanza](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/14689689)﻿ the mod has a Synthesis patcher named [SynOblivionInteractionIcons](https://github.com/cacodemonkey/synOblivionInteractionIcons_1.x). It can be found from within Synthesis' GUI as ***SynOblivionInteractionIcons\_1.x***. I would like to thank everyone else who has contributed so far as well - you're awesome!
  
  
If you want to generate DSD patch files conveniently, running the patcher is still recommended for automatic icon assignment. Otherwise, it is still functional for English-language games, and offers 100% icon coverage in your load order - but new features like color schemes will generally be restricted to the DSD patches.
  
  
  
 ***﻿Requirements*** 
  
[Dynamic String Distributor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/107676) is a hard requirement for 2.5+.
  
 For version 2.4 - which will remain available in perpetuity - no other mods are required for functionality, period.
  
  
 ***﻿Installation*****Load this mod's files last.**This will solve 99% of issues.
  
  
***﻿ ﻿Compatibility*** 
  
 **﻿Without patches**
  
**Completionist**
  
**SkyHUD**
  
**TrueHUD**
  
**Better Third Person Selection:** Config file included for a cleaner look.
  
**Notification overhaul:**Compatible with 2.5. 
  
**Read or Take SKSE:** Fully compatible with no patches.
  
  
 ﻿**With Patches**
  
**Simple Activate SKSE:** Patch is automatically installed. Load OII after or you will not see icons.
  
**Immersive Activate SKSE:** This is part of the 'Immersive Prompts' experience in the installer.
  
**Use or Take SKSE:** Patch included in installer.
  
**Purchaseable Store Display Items:** Patch remains in installer.
  
**powerofthree's Tweaks:** Make sure to set Load Door Activate Prompt = 0 in the .ini so door icons are shown.
  
  
 **﻿Incompatible / Known Issues**
  
**MoreHUD:** Compatible but some features (like show read books) may break. I would recommend [Completionist](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46358), which has perfect compatibility.
  
**The Curator's Companion:**  Due to the aforementioned poor MoreHUD interactions this may have issues.
  
**iActivate:** Incompatible but fully superceded by Simple Activate SKSE or BTPS. 
  
**More Colorful UI (SKSE):**Incompatible, cannot be used with OII.
  
  
[Dynamic Activation Key mods:](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/96273) Compatible! Patches are available in installer for the following mods using this framework:

Simply Knock or Simpler Knock - Supported via [Just Knock.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/103004)﻿
  
  
 **﻿Mods adding plants or activators:** 
  
  
Most™ should be covered in 2.5.
  
If you encounter an ACTI or FLOR record without an icon, provide the FormID and plugin when requesting a patch or, preferably, [make a patch!](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/7348)
  
  
 ***﻿Quick Loot Compatibility*** 
  
Versions 2.0+ of [QuickLootIE - A QuickLoot EE Fork](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120075) fix a years-old incompatibility in Quick Loot that prevented icons from showing properly without additional patched menus. Therefore, any patched menus built from QuickLootIE 2.0+ are **natively compatible** with OII with no additional requirements beyond version 2.3 of this mod.
  
  
**A few reskins for QuickLoot IE 2.0 to match popular UI overhauls are already available:**
  
  
[Untarnished UI - QuickLoot IE Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/123475) - Thanks to Wuerfelhusten!

[QLIE Lootmenu for DDDM](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120075?tab=files&file_id=532457) - by AtomCrafty
  
[Outlander UI II](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/118815?tab=description)﻿ (natively supported) - This one's by me. 
  
  
 ***﻿For Modders******How do I patch a mod I am making?***
  
There are two methods.
  
The first is to include a version of your file that uses my icon tags in the **RNAM - Activate Override** fields of any ACTI or FLOR records in the mod.
  
The second, recommended method, is to [create a .JSON patch file](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/7348) for DSD. This requires no plugin edits.
  
  
***How do I patch a mod that dynamically replaces activate text?***
  
Most mods that do this use a Perk with the Set Label function that triggers off of certain conditions. You can simply replace the Perk EPFD - Text field with an Iconographia icon tag like you would use for an ACTI - RNAM record. Please see **skymoji.esp** for an example of how this is done.
  
  
For a more robust method, I would recommend using DSD. See the included DAK/skymoji.esp patches or just PM me if you're working on a mod and want to add native support.
  
  
Scripted overrides that function like iActivate would require the script itself to be edited and recompiled, and an alias to be added (like $SKMJ\_Activate) - but this method introduces some visual lag and is not recommended. See the PSDI patch from 2.4 to see how this can be done. If there is no source available for a papyrus scripted mod, use [Champollion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35307) to decompile the .pex file.
  
 ***﻿Looking for more minimal-fantasy goodness?***You're in luck! If you like pen-and-paper nostalgia mixed with sharp modern design, you might just like my new UI overhaul - Outlander II. Check it out below.
