# Hotkey Reminder

A custom menu so you can write down what key does what. The idea is burrowed from Wildlander, where at the press of a button you can see all the hotkeys. When you press a key (default F11, configurable in MCM) you'll see a keyboard/gamepad and you can click on the keys/buttons to type out what that key does. The data is saved in a file ("interface/hotkeysreminder\_data.json") so it carries across multiple characters. You can press Esc to close the menu.
  
  
After you're finished adding the labels and key combos, you can go to the MCM menu and enable the option to Disallow Edit, this will hide the prompt when you click on the keys.
