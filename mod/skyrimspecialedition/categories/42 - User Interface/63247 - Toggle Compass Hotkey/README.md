# Toggle Compass Hotkey

Uses the X key by default. See your compass when you want to find a quest target, hide it when you want to get lost in the wilderness. Please be aware that this will also hide your shout and Survival Mode temperature indicators (as of 1.4 there's an option for this, primarily to ensure TrueHUD compatibility)
  
  
Compared to [Toggle Compass](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19922):
  
Uses a dedicated hotkey. Doesn't sit in your list of powers.
  
Compared to [Immersive HUD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12440):
  
*﻿Only* touches the compass and floating markers. Friendlier towards [TrueHUD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62775).
  
  
This checks the states of various HUD widgets (especially in Toggle on Activate mode) and might not be compatible with mods that make significant changes to the HUD and how it functions.
