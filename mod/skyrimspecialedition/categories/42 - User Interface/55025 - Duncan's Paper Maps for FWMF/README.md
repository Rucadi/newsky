**Duncan's Paper Maps for FWMF**

  
  
This is an adaptation of Duncan Larsen's paper maps for a Flat World Map Framework. It includes all his maps except Darkend, which is completely outdated geo and markers wise (explanation in sticky).
  
  
Mod includes:
  
  

  
* [size=3]Solstheim map (with background)
  
Bruma county map (from BS: Bruma, with background)
  
- Wyrmstooth map (with background)
Falskaar map (with background)
  
- Alik'r Desert map (from The Grey Cowl of Nocturnal, with background)

Maps available via up-to-date FOMOD or as standalone mods (in Old Versions).
  
Wyrmstooth map is slightly outdated - missing one major island to the north and some minor POIs there and Bruma map is a somewhat limited zoom/inclination wise due to BS: Bruma mesh specifics.

**Requirements**

  
* [FWMF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29932)﻿

  
**Installation**
  
[size=3]The archive is mod manager compatible.
  
  
Install [size=3][FWMF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29932) FOMOD first (Fantasy Paper Maps package preferable). Make sure FMWF is the last in plugins list (only weather fixes or FWMF various patches may be lower), then install this mod normally and place it last in mod order.
  
  
[/size]Make sure Flat Map Markers config file (FlatMapMarkersSSE.json) has segments for all chosen worldspaces (pick *All Skyrim Maps + DLCs + Worldspace Mods* during FWMF FOMOD installation).
  
[/size]
  
> **If you install multiple maps from this mod including Bruma, make sure Bruma is the last in plugin list and [b]make sure to either set FOV higher than 80 or use [Baka World Map FOV](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/132177) setting in FWMF FOMOD with value higher than 80.** Otherwise Bruma map may be glitchy on its northern edge. Also installation Bruma map will disable camera inclination for *ALL* FWMF maps unless you are using FWMF MCM with different inclination setting.[/b]

  
**Compatibility** 
  
[size=3]Compatible - Skyrim SE/AE/GOG (1.6.640 including), but be sure to pick your exact Skyrim version during FWMF FOMOD installation.
  
Compatible - both [The Gray Cowl of Nocturnal SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4509) and [The Gray Cowl of Nocturnal - 10th anniversary](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/141327).
  
Not compatible - any map mods except [FMWF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29932).
  
  
[/size]**Recommended Mods**
  
[Atlas Map Markers - Updated with MCM](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24104)﻿ works perfect and smaller markers make map more readable. Just be sure to put Atlas' .esp before FWMF in load order.
  
  
Get along with most UI overhauls. [Dear Diary UI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23010)﻿ and its skins are highly recommended.
  
  
**Known Issues**
  
Some POI and geo features not covered on Wyrmstooth map, camera limitation on Bruma map.
