**Skuldafn Paper Map for FWMF**
  
  
This mod gives Skuldafn a paper map.
  
This is the first paper map mod I created.
  
It's simple, but it works well enough to navigate Skuldafn.
  
I used the [Paper Blackreach Map for FWMF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53878) as a reference and it works well with them.
