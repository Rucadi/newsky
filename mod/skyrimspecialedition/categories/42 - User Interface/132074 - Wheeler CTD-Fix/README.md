**Wheeler CTD-Fix**

  
  
[dTry's Wheeler](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97345) saved my life in Skyrim, but sometimes this mod causes a CTD.(maybe)
  
  
(For example, when a [created potion](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Created_Potions_(Skyrim)) is added to a Wheeler slot and, for some reason, the potion is consumed. Afterward, when activating the Wheeler UI, it crashes.) So, I tried to fix this issue and also attempted to resolve other potential situations that could lead to a CTD.
  
  
work both on SE(1.5.97) and AE(1.6.1170)
  
Have fun playing!
  
  
  

**Please Pay Attention (Very Important!)**

  
  
If you load a saved game, remember to enter **Wheeler's edit mode and delete all of your previous Wheeler layouts** before taking any action, or you will continue to experience CTD issues.
