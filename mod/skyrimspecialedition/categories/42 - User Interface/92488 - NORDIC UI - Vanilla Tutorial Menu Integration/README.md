Did you miss this mod? Have you ever noticed it? No?
  
Do you think it's worth installing a dedicated mod for a menu that appears four times in the entire game? Yes?
  
Then this is the mod for you.
  
Personally, I've always disliked a lack of consistency. Those menus that jump out at you with every new playthrough are not covered by your favorite UI mod.
