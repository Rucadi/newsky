I always hated how the in-game clock was in a 12 hour format, without any way to change it. While making a mod to change it, I decided to replace the entire time/date format used by the game to a custom one.
  
  
With this mod you can:
  
- Change between 12 and 24 hour time formats
  
- Change between different date formats
  
- Hide certain parts of the time or date
  
- Replace the in-game clock with an "immersive" one. Instead of showing you the precise time, it will show you "Afternoon" or "Night"
  
  
The mod comes with some presets, to make it easier to use. However, if you want to create your own format, you can change it in the provided .ini file. The mod is highly customizable.
  
If you want to use the "immersive" clock, you can also change the names of the parts of the day on a hourly basis.
  
  
Installation:
  
- Requires [SKSE64](https://skse.silverlock.org/) as this is a .dll mod.
  
- The mod comes with a FOMOD installer. It will allow you to choose between different presets.
