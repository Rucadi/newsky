With Skyrim's Got Talent mod you can play instruments and gradually gain experience and get better at it. This mod let's you see how far you've progressed at that instrument, right in your inventory. That's it.
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
All mods should be compatible, including UI overhauls. The progressbar may be misplaced, in such a case you can use the MCM to reposition it. The options are persistent and will carry over across your save, so you only need to do this once.
