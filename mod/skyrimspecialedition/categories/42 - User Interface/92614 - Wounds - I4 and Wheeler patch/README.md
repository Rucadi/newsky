Assigns appropriate icons to injuries added by [Wounds](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17581). No ESP.
  
  
Spells from [Wounds add-ons - Healers - Spells - Patches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31088) are also supported.
  
  
Fractures/broken bones have a dedicated icon.
  
As of 1.2 concussions also have an icon.
  
Bruises and cuts have a generic icon.
  
Infections have a basic effect icon right now.
  
  
Many thanks to [GroundAura](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90508), who helped me figure out how to add icons to Active Effects.
  
  
The Wheeler patch will only work if you have Wheeler installed. If it's not present, there will be no issues.
  
  
[Inventory Interface Information Injector](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85702) and [Keyword Item Distributor (KID)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55728) are required.
