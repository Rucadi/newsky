Decided it would be better to just have them all in one place instead of having individual nexus pages just for JSON config files.
  
  
**What this is:**
  
A small collection of converted Custom Skills Framework config files to the new JSON format to replace the old configs shipped with these mods. This "should" also solve the issue of the skill menu not opening in Anniversary Edition when using these skill mods.
  
  
**Why?**
  
Because I wanted to.
  
  
**Current config conversions include:**
  
[Custom Skills - Hand To Hand](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46425)
  
[Custom Skills - Unarmoured Defense](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52616)
  
[Custom Skills - VIGILANT](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45026)﻿
  
[Custom Skills - GLENMORIL](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45120)
  
[Prelude to Purgatory - A Lich Custom Skill Tree](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53143)
  
  
**Install:**
  
- Install the original mod and it's requirements, make sure to use Custom Skills Framework 3.0.0+ (Do not install NetScriptFramework).
  
- Install the desired skill menu config from here as you would any other mod.
  
- Remove the config TXT file from the original mod, it should in the NetScriptFramework folder.
  
  
**All credit goes to the original mod authors as this is just a config conversion.**
