Many thanks to the users and maintainers of the Elder Scrolls Fandom Wiki
  
﻿and to the users and maintainers of the Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages
  
where a majority of these descriptions and FormIds were sourced.
  
(Although I still had to write and edit over 300+ entries.)

That said, if I missed anything or if the Wikis were missing any books or notes
  
please report them to me in the bugs tab and I will add them promptly.
  
  
Additionally, all of my descriptions were given a priority of minus one, so feel free
  
to write alternative descriptions for any unique texts such as
  
the Thalmor Dossier or The Lusty Argonian Maid.
  
  
Also, I highly recommend [Book Covers Skyrim Updated](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58376?tab=description)﻿ which IS compatible.
  
And be sure to grab the [2K retextures from here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69568?tab=description)﻿.
  
  
This does not cover any Creation Club content aside from
  
the included Fishing and Saints & Seducers packs.
