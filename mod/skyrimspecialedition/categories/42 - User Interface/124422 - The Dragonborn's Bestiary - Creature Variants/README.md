This mod adds 10 new entries to the awesome [Dragonborn's Bestiary mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/123521) by [JPSteel2](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/JPSteel2/about-me?gameId=1704). The creatures added to the bestiary are variants to existing creatures from the vanilla game, and are as follows:
  
  

  
* ﻿Flame Spider
Frost Spider
  
* Shock Spider
Poison Spider
  
* Oil Spider
Mind Control Spider
  
* Mounted Riekling
Falmer Shaman
  
* Feral Falmer
Frozen Falmer
  

  
Aside from killing them, the magical spiders can be added to the bestiary by pressing the activate key on a non-hostile individual. So make sure to say hi to your little spider buddy!
  
  
This mod may be updated in the future if I happen to have missed a creature variant or two. And I'm open to any feedback if there's anything that can be improved!
