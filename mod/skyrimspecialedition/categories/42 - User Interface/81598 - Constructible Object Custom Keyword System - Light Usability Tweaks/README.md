# Constructible Object Custom Keyword System - Light Usability Tweaks
- Author: LoLzies
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

Changes Constructible Object Custom Keyword System's "Weapons & Armor" grouping into several smaller groups. Has support for weapon categories added by [Animated Armoury](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35978) but it's not required.

**Requires**
  
[Constructible Object Custom Keyword System](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81409) and all its requirements. Please, endorse the original mod.
  
  
Installation
  
Just install using your favorite mod manager.
  
  
Note
  
The clothing category may have some weird items strewn about in them like amulets and capes being in "body". That's due to how some armor mods keyword their items and it's not really a bug. I've only tested with Immersive Armors installed and I haven't really done much testing outside of that.
  
  
If two mods use the same keyword name but not the same Form ID, the items from the mod later in load order will get sorted into the right category and the others will be in one of the default Skyrim categories (Dagger, Sword, Mace, War Axe,. Greatsword, Warhammer, Battleaxe) depending on the keywords. That's unfortunately how Skyrim works. If you are using Animated Armoury, there might be a patch for it but I can't really help you otherwise.
  
  
This is my first mod (and a mod of a mod to boot) so I do apologize if something goes wrong for you. Comment the issue and I'll see if I can help you.
