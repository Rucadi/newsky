"I am aware the game has updated. I don't have a lot of time/energy to work on these things anymore, and I will my mods on my own time. Stop  contacting me."

Rather than posting yet another comment on the I'm walkin' here modpage asking for an update to the new Skyrim version I just did it myself.
  
  
Source code is available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/VersuchDrei/ImWalkinHere/).
  
  
  
I will most likely not add any more updates to this other than maybe bugfixes or support for new Skyrim versions if there are more to come.
