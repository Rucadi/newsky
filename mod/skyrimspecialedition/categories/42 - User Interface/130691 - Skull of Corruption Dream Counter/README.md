# Skull of Corruption Dream Counter

Skull of Corruption is a Daedric artifact with a unique mechanic, you cast on sleeping targets to steal their dreams and charge up the staff, then you can cast on waking targets to use those charges and damage them. This unique staff shows a notification message whenever you use it. That did not seem befitting such an artifact. With this mod, when you equip the staff, a little widget shows up on the bottom right corner of the screen, showing how much charge it already has.
  
Note that your "dream charge" is a separate thing from enchantment charge, the staff also requires and eats soul gems in order to be used.
  
  
**Interested in making SkyUI widgets?**
  
I have written a tutorial, detailing how this mod was made. It's very thorough (I hope!) and if you're interested in making your own SkyUI widgets it's a good starting point. It's available on Nexus: <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/130692>
