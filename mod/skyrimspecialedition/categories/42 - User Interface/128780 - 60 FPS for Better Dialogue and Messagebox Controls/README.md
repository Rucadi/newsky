# 60 FPS for Better Dialogue and Messagebox Controls

**What does this mod do?**
  
It takes improvements from ecirbaf's [Better Messagebox Controls](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1428) and [Better Dialogue Controls](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1429) and makes the menus run at 60 FPS. Nothing more, nothing less.
  
  
When you use 60 FPS menu mods, they might overwrite ecirbaf's files, making them 60 FPS but losing the improved controls. Or they don't cover them, or you make ecirbaf's mods overwrite them, in which case these menus keep their improved controls, but remain at 30/24 FPS, which might look jarring/inconsistent with the rest of the game. This mod lets you have the best of both worlds, menus that control well and look buttery smooth.
  
  
**Installation & load order?**Install using your favorite mod manager, or manually. Load order should be:
  

  
* 60 FPS mod of your choice (I use [Smooth Interface (60fps)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1766)﻿)
ecirbaf's mods
  
* This mod

Just let this overwrite everything and you are good to go.
  
  
Technically, you don't need to install ecirbaf's original mods. But you are going to. And you will leave him an endorsement for both.
