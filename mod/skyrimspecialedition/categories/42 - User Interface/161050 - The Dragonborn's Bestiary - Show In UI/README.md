Adds an entry for The Dragonborn's Bestiary to Skyrim's main menu.
  
  
**But Bestiary already has an option to display itself in the menu?**
  
Bestiary has an option in its "Dragonborns Bestiary.ini" file to enable displaying it in the main menu:
  
  

```
iEnableSystemMenuOption = 1
```

  
This however replaces Skyrim's Help menu. I need my help menu! Using this mod, you can have both. Just make sure that the iEnableSystemMenuOption is turned off.
  
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
This mod doesn't touch any vanilla records and is compatible with everything.
  
ESP-FE.
