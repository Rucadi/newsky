[left]**﻿Description**
  
[/left][left]A lightweight SKSE plugin that lets you hit the system menu button (Esc on keyboard, Start/Menu on controller) during conversations. Dialogue resumes normally after you close the menu.
  
  
It works as follows: The ESC button or the Menu button on the controller opens the pause menu in the dialogue. The Tab button or the B button on the controller closes the dialogue menu as before.
  
  
**Why?**
  
Ever wanted to go afk for a second without interrupting your dialogue and got attacked and killed by vampires in the meantime?

**Note**
  
This is my first SKSE project. I don’t know much about SKSE internals, but the plugin works reliably and is safe to use.
  
  
**Features**
  

  
* Pause menu works during NPC dialogue
No scripts, just a small SKSE plugin.
  
* Works with both keyboard and controller.
Safe to install/uninstall anytime.
