Inspired by Starfield. When you're in conversation with a potential follower or hirable mercenary, you will be able to see some stats about them. This includes their pool of Health, Magicka, and Stamina; plus their level. Also what skills they're good at.
  
  
  
**Custom Followers**
  
This should work fine with custom followers, provided they have proper factions set up. Tested and confirmed to work with: Auri, Remiel, Gore, Taliesin, Jesper the Guard.
  
Built-in support for Inigo, Lucien, and Katana; no patching necessary.
