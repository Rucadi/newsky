**Extended Cut - Saints and Seducers** **Paper Map for FWMF**

  
It's a paper map for Fringe Region of The Shivering Isles from EC:SS mod. Made in the same isometric way as Midwood Isle or Forgotten Vale paper maps for FWMF. Hope it will help you to navigate here and will add little bit of immersion. Mod continues series of paper maps for a [Flat World Map Framework (FWMF)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29932).
  
  
Some things to know about this map:

  
* Navigation wise map is precise but some things shown figuratively, like mountain ranges instead of stones, to give it a feeling of bigger scale.
Mania and Dementia parts differ in color slightly.
  
* Best FWMF package for this map is  "FWMF for Fantasy Paper Maps", it renders colors closest to original.
Map texture is 8K, plugin flagged as ESL.

Flat World Map Framework uses mainly vertical look at map, but allows limited inclination and rotation with held right button as well.
  
MCM in FOMOD and config INI file with comments included in FWMF allows to tune map control (keyboard, mouse and gamepad), possible angles and blur.

**Installation**
  
The archive is mod manager compatible.
  
  
Install [size=3][FWMF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29932) FOMOD first (Fantasy Paper Maps package preferable). Make sure FMWF is the last in plugins list (only weather fixes or FWMF various patches may be lower), then install this mod normally and place it last in mod order.
  
  
[/size]Mod goes with config file for Flat Map Markers (*FlatMapMarkersSSE.json*), that whitelists all worldspaces covered by paper maps, including ECSS. Alternatively you can whitelist ECSS in your custom *FlatMapMarkersSSE.json* by adding this block:
  
  
> ﻿ ﻿{
>   
>  "name": "Shivering Isles",
>   
>  "editorID": "ecssshiveringisles",
>   
>  "markerHeight": 180000,
>   
>  "enabled": true
>   
>  }

  
Version **1.1** doesn't have custom Flat Map Markers config, make sure you have whitelisting block for ECSS on FWMF FOMOD side.
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
[size=3]SE/AE/GOG compatible (1.6.640 including), but be sure to pick your exact Skyrim version during FWMF FOMOD installation.
  
Not compatible with map mods except [FMWF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29932).
  
  
[/size]**Recommended Mods**
  
[Atlas Map Markers - Updated with MCM](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24104)﻿ works perfect and smaller markers make map more readable. Just be sure to put Atlas' .esp before FWMF in load order.
  
  
Get along with most UI overhauls. [Dear Diary UI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23010)﻿ and its skins are highly recommended.
  
  
**Known Issues**
  
None so far.

**For mapmakers, modders and modlist authors**
  
If you would like to create your own paper-like maps for Skyrim, its DLCs and add-ons, you just need to ask me in Discord - it is simpler than it seems. Some maps are technically ready for drawing already, for others I will provide detailed instructions what to do.
  
  
Modlist authors that wish to add FWMF maps to their lists and have requests to tune/fix some things, feel free to PM me, I will try to help  the best I can.
