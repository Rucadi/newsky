**Quest Journal Overhaul** is a complete rework of the Quest menu inspired by **modern RPGs** like The Outer Worlds, Cyberpunk 2077 or good ol' The Witcher 3. The objective of this revamp is to make the Quest journal **more visually appealing** and **easier to navigate**, while staying faithful to the game's original design and art direction.
  
  
  
**Features:**

  
* Separation of quests by category: Main Quests, Side Quests, Factions, Completed and Failed
Location icons including all Skyrim Holds, Morrowind's Redoran Territories and Cyrodiil's Bruma County
  
* "!" indicator for new quests
Miscellaneous Quests get their own screen (on the press of a button)
  
* Option to hide completed and failed quests
Dynamic knotwork for Civil War and Dawnguard questlines (changes depending on who you sided with)
  
* Full gamepad compatibility

  
Future plans:
  

  
* Quests limit fix

The Quest menu can be opened normally either by **navigating the Pause menu** or by pressing the **Journal hotkey** ("J" by default).
  
  
The **quests** are displayed on the left of the screen. The list can be navigated with the **mouse scroll** or **joystick**. To **select a quest**, the usual action buttons will work (**Enter**/**Click**/**[E](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/365/826/f2f.jpg)**/**Right direction**). **New quests** are marked by a **"!" symbol** that will disappear once the quest has been displayed for the first time.
  
  
The description and objectives are displayed on the right. To **scroll the objectives** list, you can the **mouse scroll** or **LT**/**RT** with gamepad.
  
  
You can press **H** (or **RS** with gamepad) to **hide the Completed and Failed categories**. Pressing that same button again will make them reappear.
  
  
Pressing **M (**or **Y** with gamepad) will **open the map menu** and center on the selected quest's current objective.
  
  
Pressing **Q** (or **X** with gamepad) will display the **Misc Objectives** screen.

In the Misc Objectives screen, you can browse the list and select quests exactly the same way as in the main screen. With this mod installed, the vanilla "Miscellaneous" quests is set to be always active, so all the objectives selected in the Misc Objectives screen will appear on your map and compass.

The location and knotwork of quests can be edited with JSON files, and support for quest mods can also be easily added. The distribution of quests in the different categories can be modified with a JSON file as well.
  
 For more details, please refer to the following guides:

The menu supports Scaleform translation.

The new menu is compatible with all quest mods, because it pulls its data directly from the vanilla Quest menu. Any quest that would appear in the vanilla Quest menu will still appear with this mod installed. However, the location data needs to be manually set for each quest. This means that without a corresponding JSON, a modded quest won't have any location associated to it (i.e. the banner on the right will be empty).
  
  
In addition to the base game, Dawnguard and Dragonborn quests, the following mods are supported by default:
  

  
* [Official Creation Club content](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Creation_Club)﻿
[Beyond Skyrim: Bruma](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10917)﻿
  
* [East Empire Expansion](https://kinggathcreations.com/east-empire-expansion/)﻿
[Bards College Expansion](https://kinggathcreations.com/bards-college-expansion/)﻿
  
* [Tales of Skyrim - Berserkyr](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/103559)﻿

Quest Journal Overhaul is compatible with the [Knotwork](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/128235) mod. You can download the compatibility patch directly on Knotwork's mod page.
  
  
Currently not compatible with [Wiki and Map Integration](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/126202) (will CTD when pressing the Journal hotkey).
  
  
Please note that to work as intended, this mod must overwrite any other mod editing the quest journal. Please make sure that this mod's "quest\_journal.swf" takes priority over any other file of the same name.
