[/font]Active effect icons and optional time meter stylized to match the [Nordic UI Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49881)﻿ by [outobugi](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/27579385?tab=user+files)! Color matched, style matched, should look fine and dandy underneath the Nordic UI compass and its map markers.
  
  
Thickness of the outlines for each icon were fine tuned to match in-game.

**Compatible with everything, unless it also replaces SkyUI active effect icons.
  
  
No ESP, safe to install/uninstall mid-game.**![](https://i.imgur.com/ex9plr7.png)

[font=Trebuchet MS]**[b]*\*\*Does not Require Nordic UI, but its installation is highly recommended for all icons to match.*
