# QUI - Unofficial Update

QUI causes crashes in 1130+. I reorganized the source code so I can work with it and compiled it against a more up-to-date version of commonlib. I then compiled it, and that's about it.
  
  
Install the original mod, install this and overwrite. That's it.
  
This mod is built on the work of Quidix, and carries the same license (GPL-3).
