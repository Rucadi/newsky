I was so stoked to find Alchemy recipe view mode mod. I had asked about such a thing [two years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/15bu7tw/mod_to_list_known_ingredients_in_the_alchemy_menu/) on Reddit! The only problem is unless you know you have such a mod installed, you will forget that it exists and use it. That's what this mod does, adds a UI button in Alchemy menu, and also adds an MCM so you can change the hotkey in that mod.
  
  
If you have changed the hotkey in the mod, it is reflected in the UI.
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
This mod doesn't touch any records. File is ESP-FE.
