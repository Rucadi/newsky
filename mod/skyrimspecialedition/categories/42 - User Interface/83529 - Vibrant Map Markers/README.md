# Vibrant Map Markers
- Author: AptenodytE
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/83529


**Features:**
  
- all markers with gradiant in .svg format so no jagged edges of the markers and reduced file size
  
- fixed vanilla paths of the markers where necessary
  
- tweaked some of the markers from the original Colorful Map Markers Mod where I thought it was an improvement
  
- added CoMAP markers (Bruma, CoMAP, CotN, Holds, LotD, Maslea, Wt --> all covered)
  
- Compass compatability for vanilla, SkyHUD and Compass Navigation Overhaul as of version 1.1. There is an optional file if using Dear Diary Dark Mode and Compass Navigation Overhaul for the updated Compass (if DDDM gets updated this will no longer be necessary).
  
  
**Planned Features:**
  
~~- Compass compatability. Will be added as soon as the compatability of the Compass Navigation Overhaul and CoMAP is released. For SkyHUD and other HUD mods this could already be provided, but I want to finish the Compass setup all in one.~~
  
  
**Installation:**Just install it with your mod manager and use the FOMOD for the CoMAP and Compass options according to your setup. Then let my mod overwrite the other mods.
  
  
**Feedback:**
  
Please leave your feedback in the Comments section. I will not react to DMs and unfortunately I can provide only very superficial technical support since I am a beginner. So any missing markers, weird colors etc. is very likely out of my abilities to help you with.

> Well, the original markers have been made not as .svg but imported .png files which allowed the original creator to use more sophistaced effects such as blur or glow effects. While I tried to recreate these effects with decent succes in Inkscape using a blur method and radial gradiant effects the reimporting of the files in the FFDec (JPEXS) did not support these features. Hence there are only gradiant effects in the windows/lights, but no blur sadly. This might very well be possible by changing the DefineShapeTag but I do not know enough about these things as a beginner.

> For some markers I made these changes because I consider them an improvement in color variety or just being closer to vanilla (Riften, Morthal i.e.) If you disagree with these changes feel free to change them or just use the markers from the other mods.}
