﻿INTRODUCTION

  
The mod is fairly straight forward. It was originally created by Humbro8282 for SLE. But has not been touch or updated in a awhile. I took the liberty to open it up and delete some minor redundant text. The core features work as intended.
  
  
This mod alters the the sleep/wait menu to be more less intrusive i.e. more immersive while at the same time allowing you to wait for up to 744 in game days! ENJOY!
  
  
  

Installation!

1. Install with preferred MOD MANAGER
  
2. Needs to overwrite any other SLEEP/WAIT Menu interface mod!
  
3. PLAY!!

* Any mod that change the file "sleepwaitmenu.swf"
So far no other issues have been found during my personal testing!
  

NOTES

Rest/Wait for 31 days is equivalent to 12 minutes (real time).
  
If you want you can drastically reduce the waiting time following this procedure:
  
1. Open Console >> write TFC push Enter >> quit the console
  
2. Wait/Rest
  
3. Open Console >> write TFC push enter
