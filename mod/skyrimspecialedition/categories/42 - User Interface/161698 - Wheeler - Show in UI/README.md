Wheeler is an amazing, must-have mod. Its only flaw is it's a bit difficult to work with, you have to remember multiple hotkeys in order to make use of it. That's where this mod comes in. This will show you a prompt in your Inventory / Magic menus for the button that toggles the Wheeler. Also after you activate the wheeler you'll see the hotkeys required for adding wheels/slots and navigating it.
  
In the latter case (when the Wheeler is open) the hints go behind the Wheeler itself, it's unfortunate but they're still very readable.
  
  
Gamepad is supported. All the hotkeys are retrieved automatically based on your settings in Wheeler.
