**About this Mod**
  
  
This is a rebuild of my previous mod that was hiding the UI, with a single keypress you configure in the MCM.
  
My previous mod achieved this by triggering the "tm" console command which is a nice feature for screenshots but does make any UI elements invisible including the console, dialog menus and everything else.
  
  
This mod only hides the "HUD Menu" which is the UI element all widgets, status bars and all that get registered to.
  
  
As a bonus since I use it as well and the worst that happens is a papyrus log message if it isn't installed was support for hiding the Minimap form the Minimap mod, which uses a separate menu I had to hide separately.
  
  
Installation
