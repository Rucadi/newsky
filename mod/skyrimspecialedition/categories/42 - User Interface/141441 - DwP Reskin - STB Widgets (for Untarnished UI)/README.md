# DwP Reskin - STB Widgets (for Untarnished UI)

**What is this?**
  
  
It's a personal reskin for STB Widgets to make it look like it belongs to Untarnished UI.
  
Every icon is hand drawn and designed by me, to match Untarnished UI's style.
  
There are two versions you can chose from, a version with diamond frames and one with just the icons.
  
  
**How do I install it?**
  
  
First, you'll need to download the original [STB Widgets mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/136148)
  
Second, you'll need to download this mod and allow to overwrite it.
  
Third, you'll need to do some size, position, tweaking by hitting the End key in game.
  
  
Can I see how it looks?
