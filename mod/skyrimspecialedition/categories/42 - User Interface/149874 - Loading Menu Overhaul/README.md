For a menu we spend so much time in, an overhaul was long overdue! Nothing too crazy here, just **a few features I thought would be nice to have in the** **Loading Menu** without cluttering it with tons of different widgets. Here is what you get with this mod:
  
  

  
* Trivia messages centered on screen
Ability to **swipe through messages** (Q/R, or LB/RB with gamepad)
  
* Loading location name displayed (if available)
Level and XP bar on top-left, layout slightly modified

Compatible with anything that doesn't edit loadingmenu.swf. [Oblivion-like Loading Menu SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38708) needs a patch, available in the optional files.
  
  
This mod is compatible with all mods adding new load screens and load screen messages. In the screenshots you can see examples with [Starlit Lakes Loading Screens](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57579) and [Lore-Friendly Load Screen Compendium](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/138294). Other mods that modify load screens in other ways are compatible too. For example:
  

  
* [Loading Screen Smoke Removed](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4634)
[Spinning Load Screens](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/83907)
  
* [Improved Loading Screen Colors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61712)﻿

  
This mod will also automatically adapt to whatever screen resolution you are using, no need for patches.
