**Tween Menu Overhaul** is a complete rework of Skyrim's Tween Menu. The main purpose of this mod is to make the Tween Menu **fully modular**, giving you the ability to add new shortcuts for vanilla and mod-added menus.
  
This mod is also a visual overhaul of the Tween Menu, coming in two versions: Classic and Alternative.

The Tween Menu comes in **two distinct versions**. They both share the same technical features but drastically differ in style. Pick your favorite.

"Tween Menu Overhaul - Classic" is closer to vanilla layout. It has 4 main categories (fully customizable) in which the different options are distributed.

The menu can be navigated with mouse or with directional input (keyboard/gamepad). With directional input, the first direction given will select the category. You can then scroll the category's options list with Up/Down input.

"Tween Menu Overhaul - Alternative" offers a completely new layout, with a single scrollable row containing all the different options.

The menu can be navigated with [size=3]mouse (incl. scroll), directional input (keyboard/gamepad), or with LT/RT (gamepad). The arrows that appear when there are more than 5 selectable options (7 on widescreen) are also clickable.

The main point of Tween Menu Overhaul is the ability to **add an infinite amount of options** to the tween menu. Menus that were otherwise only accessible through the System page (e.g. Quests, Bestiary, Achievements) or by using specific items or spells can now directly be added to the Tween Menu with a simple JSON.
  
Check the [article](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/9866) for more details on how to add/edit options for the Tween Menu.
  
  
For the Classic version, the 4 categories can be modifed by editing "Tween Menu Overhaul\interface\tweenoptions\categories\categories.json"

This mod must overwrite any other mod editing "interface\tweenmenu.swf", otherwise it won't work.
  
  
It will automatically detect if you are using [Quest Journal Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/141295) and won't need a patch for it.
  
  
In the optional files, you will find **add-ons** to add Tween Menu options for the following mods:
  

  
* [Custom Skills Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62423)
[The Dragonborn's Bestiary](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/123521)
  
* [Achievement Injector](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/126220)

  
There is also a preset to add the Sleep/Wait Menu directly to the Tween Menu.
  
  
The mod is **compatible with widescreen by default**. If you are playing on AE 1.6.1130+, please don't forget to install [Widescreen Scale Removed](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/136793).
