# Abyssal Tides Magic - I4 Icons

I really like the Abyssal Tides Magic mod. And because of that I always wanted the icons to be a green color, for 1) aesthetics, and 2) so I can pick them out in the spells list easier. So that is where this mod came in!  I made it for myself but thought 'why not share it with anyone else who would like it?'
  
  
I have pulled the icons from different mods, which will be listed below. I also added two different options for how the spells icons will look, which are included in the fomod, and you can pick whichever one you like better. 
  
There is also an optional file that you only need if you **DO NOT** already have [B.O.O.B.I.E.S](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89241). That file contains the icons for the books, and if you have B.O.O.B.I.E.S. then you will already have that file installed.
  
  
**Optional file:**
  

  
* I have added a dummy esp(fe) named the same as the Abyssal Tides ESL. If you use a mod like [Kome's Inventory Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/116713) you can place the esp below the esp from that mod and it should allow the icons to still show up.
I have added a [Wheeler](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97345) patch so the icons will show up there.﻿

This is yet another mod that I'm using to poke around with coding and other things related to moding. This is the first fomod I have ever written/created, and also the first time I've messed with applying custom icons.  Hopefully they work for everyone!
