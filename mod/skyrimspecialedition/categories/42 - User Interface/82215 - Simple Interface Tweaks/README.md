* **INTRODUCTION**

I've always struggled to find the proper interface overhaul for me: many of them are awesome, but sometimes are not perfectly consistent or lack compatibility with third party features. So one day I realized that sticking to the vanilla UI was the right solution: not only it actually has a good style, but nowadays there are also many mods that improve it by fixing, tweaking and adding stuff, so why bothering with anything else? However, I'm also a minimalist: when there are many mods that cover one specific aspect of the game, I like to have them grouped in a single all-in-one, to keep an *elegant* and *clean* load order. So I decided to create a simple expansion mod for SkyUI (which is basically *essential* in every load order), so this is *not* technically a new mod but more a *compilation* of mods. If you, like me, like to have as few mods as possible, without having to download them individually, this might work for you. Of course, it's not only a big general fix: there is also a lot of *personal taste* here, but still in line with the vanilla feeling of the game. Why bothering to use this? Well, this way if you want to start over to modify your interface, you can use this mod as a base and build upon it. Basically, it's just a comfort shortcut. I also don't use Collections, so that was one more reason for me to create this, other than laziness. You can also use only this, for a more vanilla oriented playthrough. It's your choice, your game.
  
  
  

  
* **WHAT'S INCLUDED IN THIS MOD**

These are the mods that I included in this simple one-click-install SkyUI extension, based on my personal taste but as true to vanilla as possible:
  
  
[Wider MCM Menu for SkyUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22825) (Opt. 1, version 1.2) by uranreactor
  
[Better Sleep Wait Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4212?tab=description) (72h, version 1.0) by Mortiganto
  
[Remove QuickSave Button from SkyUI System Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28334) (Save-MCM-Load-etc, version 1.1) by uranreactor
  
(NOTE: this mod also contains a fix similar to SkyUI SE - Flashing Savegames Fix by ousinius, so it's not needed)
  
[Better Dialogue Controls](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1429) (version 1.2) by ecirbaf
  
[Better Messagebox Controls](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1428?tab=files) (version 1.2) by ecirbaf
  
[Favorite Things - Extended Favorites Menu for SkyUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27177?tab=description) (Opt. 1, version 1.0) by uranreactor
  
[Sovngarde - A Nordic Font](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/386) (Light, version 8.9) by Koveich
  
[Yet Another Main Menu Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53798?tab=files) (version 1.0) by foreverphoenix
  
(NOTE: this mod also requires a patch for the AE version of the game, which is included in all of the files)
  
  
I have also made alternative versions that do not include the font and main menu overhaul, for those users who are not interested. 
  
  
  

  
* **RECOMMENDATIONS**

If you want to cover every other aspect of the *vanilla* interface with more *utility* I can't recommend you enough [Inventory Interface Information Injector](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85702), [Main Menu Design Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30810), [CoMAP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56123), [Simple Load Screens](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49529), [MCM Helper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53000), [More Informative Console](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19250) and [TrueHUD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62775). If you're looking for a *new* experience but not too far from vanilla, then go for either [Dear Diary Dark Mode](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60837) or [Untarnished UI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/75188).
  
  
NOTE: this mod works just fine with the latest *1.6.1170 version*, just be sure to grab [Quest Journal Fix for SkyUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/108618) (2b in the installer)!
