Modern Wait Menu is a complete overhaul and redesign of Skyrims Wait & Rest Menu inspired by modern UI elements in games like Cyberpunk 2077 and The Witcher 3. It introduces an interactive time wheel, new hoverable cursor and weather indicator allowing the player to easily select any time they desire in an understandable and improved system over Skyrims slider. This project was worked on as part of the UI created for ***The Elder Scrolls: Skyblivion*** and then reskinned to Skyrims theme as a standalone mod. This mod contains one ESL plugin.

**Q: Will this mod work with font replacers?**
  
A: Yes
  
  
**Q: Will this mod work with X UI overhaul?**
  
A: In testing with mods such as nordic UI, and Sky UI there has been no reported issues. Unless a mod directly changes the functionality of the wait menu it should work with any UI mod.
  
  
**Q: Can I install this on an existing save?**
  
A: Yes
  
  
**Q: Why is there an extra Week in front of the left Time?**
  
A: Skyrim souls is not compatible with this mod, the problem lies in how Skyrim souls is interacting with the Menu, so this can not being fixed on my side and is a problem which needs to be fixed on the side of Skyrim souls. Until the Author fixes his mod, you need to disable the Wait menu in the config of Skyrim souls.
  
Or you use a mod like "Time Format Changer", my mod currently only works with the default time string.
  
  
**Q: Why is my UI stretched?**
  
A: This is because you use the latest Version of Skyrim SE and your screen's aspect Ratio is different from 16:9, 21:9, or 32:9. With Version 1.6.1170, Bethesda introduced a "new" way of menu scaling, they now are stretching the menu so it fits, since all menus are build with 16:9 by default this causes stretching problems across other aspect ratios, the only fix for this is to build the menu in the correct aspect ratio.
