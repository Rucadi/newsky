**Short and simple this time.** 
  
Well, this basically does what it says on the tin. ;)
  
  
These are just a collection of patch INI's I made for some of the lesser known quest, new lands and boss mods out there; all of which aren't getting much attention in terms of TDM/TrueHUD support *('twas a pain in the ass to look at each NPC formid individually believe me*). These include bosses that will be encountered from mods such as: [Beyond Reach](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3008), [Colorful Magic](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13261), [Midwood Isle](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28120), [Ravengate - Riften Underground Arena](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12617), and the Here There Be Monsters series of mods ([Part I](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35929), [Call of Cthulhu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35934) and [Sign of Cipactli](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35933)). 
  
  
I'm going to post some shots of the INI's in action mixed with some shots of the bosses from these mods in question because I really think they don't get enough attention and love!
  
  
That's pretty much it! If y'all feel like I missed some bosses or added bars to NPCs that y'all don't think should be bosses, just leave me a comment and I'll try to address it ASAP! Thank you and I hope you enjoy!
