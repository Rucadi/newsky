**\*\* UPDATE \*\* Since a lot of questions appear on the Posts pages, I want to clarify this here:**
  
  
If you want to use NORDIC UI in Ultrawide Format (21:9 or 32:9), you MUST do the following:
  
  

  
1. UNINSTALL [NORDIC UI - Interface Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49881) (yes, UNINSTALL IT!)
INSTALL [Nordic UI 32 by 9 and 21 by 9 aspect ratio patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53909)
  
  
The latter "patch" above COMPLETELY REPLACES the original mod, so the former is NOT NEEDED. Despite indicating it is a "patch", it is actually a full version of NORDIC UI with ultrawide (UW) compatibility, making the original mod redundant for UW users. DO NOT USE BOTH!
  
  
My mod simply contains additional FIXES and PATCHES for ultrawide users which have ALREADY INSTALLED the ultrawide mod above. My patches are NOT COMPATIBLE with load orders that use the original (non-UW) version of NORDIC UI!!! It requires the UW version as base!!!
  
  
Sorry for not making this more clear in the past. Load order information has been added below to add further clarification.

**DESCRIPTION**
  
  
Here are some fixes and patches for **NORDIC UI**Ultrawide users (which are already using the **[Nordic UI 32 by 9 and 21 by 9 aspect ratio patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53909)**) that correct some issues with the existing Ultrawide version and also provide some additional UW compatibility for other mods and patches (such as survival mods). Many of these patches are modified versions of those found in the **NORDIC UI - MISCELLANEOUS PATCHES** (NUIMP) mod, by [myztikrice](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/916366). I have received written permission from [myztikrice](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/916366) to publish these patches, so please be sure to give +kudos to this user.
  
  
Since I only modified necessary files for ultrawide compatibility, **Frostfall** and **Sunhelm/CC Survival Mode** patches still require files found in the original NUIMP mod, so please download and install that as well ([link here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54102) - endorse while you are there!). It should be noted that that many patches contained in that download are ALREADY COMPATIBLE with ultrawide resolutions. More detail can be found in the compatibility section below.
  
  
  
**PATCHES INCLUDED**
  
  

  
* **Start Menu** ⭐NEW (v1.3)⭐ - fixed centering for ultrawide support
**Loading Screen** ⭐NEW (v1.2)⭐ - fixed loading screen offset for ultrawide support
  
* **Character Creation** ⭐NEW (v1.1)⭐ - added character creation screen with proper click zones for ultrawide support
**Gift menu** - scaling fix
  
* **Sunhelm / CC Survival Mode** -**⚠️**Requires NUIMP**⚠️**- fixed NUIMP bottom bar (it now properly scales to fill the screen)
**Frostfall**-**⚠️**Requires NUIMP**⚠️**- fixed NUIMP inventory, barter, crafting, container menus, and bottom bar (they now all properly scale to fit the screen)
  
* **Colored Icons in level up screen** - fixed NUIMP scaling which hid current and required points to train a skill (both versions)
**(Even) Better MessageBox Controls** - fixed NUIMP scaling which actually hid contextual information
  

  
  
**INSTALLATION**
  
  
FOMOD Installer - select all desired patches with preferred mod manager and overwrite all files for any conflicts.
  
  
  
**LOAD ORDER**
  
  

  
1. *(optional)* Survival Mod of choice, if applicable (e.g. **Sunhelm**, **Frostfall**, **CC Survival Mode**)
*(optional)*Survival Mod dependencies, if applicable (e.g. **Campfire**, etc.)
  
2. *(optional)*Survival Mod patches, if applicable (e.g. **Campfire+Frostfall Unofficial SSE Update**, etc.)
[**Nordic UI 32 by 9 and 21 by 9 aspect ratio patch**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53909)
  
3. *(optional)*[NORDIC UI - MISCELLANEOUS PATCHES](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54102) (ONLY if you have one of the survival mods above installed, otherwise, all other files for included NUIMP patches are already contained in my FOMOD)
**NORDIC UI - Ultrawide Fixes and Patches** (this mod)
  

  
Be sure to overwrite all previous file(s) with each subsequent mod in order above, where applicable. Again, DO NOT INSTALL THE NON-ULTRAWIDE VERSION OF NORDIC UI MOD! USE THE BASE 32 by 9 and 21 by 9 aspect ratio version linked above! Also, AVOID ANY/ALL OTHER "SkyUI interface skin" mods (such as **Complete Widescreen Fix for Vanilla and SkyUI**). That mod is completely incompatible with NORDIC UI and literally undoes all of the NORDIC UI interface changes... If it doesn't look like NORDIC and/or have a compatibility patch it won't work!
  
  
  
**COMPATIBILITY**
  
  
For reference, below is a list of some other NORDIC UI mods/patches, and whether they have native ultrawide resolution support. Not every part of the UI is broken when using ultrawide resolution so a lot of these patches can be installed on their own without need of an ultrawide patch. See notes for details.
  
  
**[NORDIC UI - MISCELLANEOUS PATCHES](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54102)** (NUIMP)
