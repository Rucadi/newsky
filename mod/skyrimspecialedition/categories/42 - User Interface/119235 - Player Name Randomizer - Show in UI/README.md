As someone without an ounce of creativity to name my characters, [Player Name Randomizer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92438) has been a welcoming addition. However you often forget that it exists. This mod aims to solve that, it simply adds a hint in the UI where you name your character that pressing the Insert key can generate a random name.
  
  
RaceMenu mod supported. You can change the key shown in the interface by adjusting the interface/NameRandomizerUI.txt file and editing the [keycode](https://ck.uesp.net/wiki/Input_Script#DXScanCodes) inside.
