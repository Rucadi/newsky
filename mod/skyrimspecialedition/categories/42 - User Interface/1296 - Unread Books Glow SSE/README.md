# Unread Books Glow SSE
- Author: duggelz
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1296
For the People that say it dont work.
  
It dont need SKSE.
  
SKSE is only need to detect books that you read BEFORE you install this mod and
  
the mcm Menu but there is a magic menu to use without SKSE.
  
Anything else works fine.
  
   
I dont have the time to support it but everyone have the permissions to make a own version as
  
long as they credit the original author duggelz and give everyone the
  
same right to do it with your work.
  
   
   
   
Unread Books Glow
  
   
Books which you have not read yet will have a visible glow. When you
  
read a book for the first time, its glow will disappear. All copies
  
of the same title are considered the same book, so once you've read
  
one "Cats of Skyrim", you've read them all.
  
   
== Features ==
  
   
\* Unread books glow and have an "\*" before their name
  
\* Tracks books from any mod or DLC
  
\* Spell tomes are green, skill books are red, quest books and regular
  
books are various shades of blue
  
\* Settings configured in-game via spell
  
   
== Install ==
  
   
Nexus Mod Manager: Click the "Download with Manager" button. Once
  
it's downloaded, in the Nexus Mod Manager, click on the "Mods" tab,
  
and double-click on "Unread Books Glow" to activate it.
  
   
   
== Upgrade ==
  
   
If you're upgrading from a previous version, you might see odd
  
behavior until you enter a new location.
  
   
== Uninstall ==
  
   
Move your character to an interior location that has no unread books.
  
Save your game and exit Skyrim.
  
   
Nexus Mod Manager: Click on the "Mods" tab, double-click on "Unread
  
Books Glow" to deactivate it, then click "Delete".
  
   
== Limitations ==
  
   
\* Books you've read before installing this mod are not recorded. You will have to read
  
them again.
  
\* Only the nearest 100 books are affected in any location.
  
\* Books in containers and merchant inventories are usually not
  
recognized as unread.
  
\* Quest books added by DLC and other mods are treated as "plain" books.
  
Spell tomes and skill books should work fine.
  
   
== Configuration ==
  
   
Open the in-game "Magic" menu,
  
select "Powers", and select "{Unread Books Glow Settings}". Then exit
  
the menu. Your character will appear to have a spell readied. Cast
  
the spell as normal (usually just clicking the left mouse button) and
  
a settings menu will appear.
  
   
== Compatibility ==
  
   
This mod should automatically handle books added by DLC and other
  
mods. However, there might be conflicts with other mods that change
  
the behavior of books in general. If you find something noteworthy
  
that does or doesn't work, let me know and I will add it here.
  
   
Compatible:
  
\* Better Skill and Quest Books Names
  
\* Book Covers Skyrim
  
\* Bookshelves Script SKSE
  
\* Improved Skill Books
  
\* Non-Automatic Skill Books
