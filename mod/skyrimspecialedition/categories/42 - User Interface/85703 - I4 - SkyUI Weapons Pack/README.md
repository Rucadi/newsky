This is a reimplementation of [SkyUI Weapons Pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37231) by Ashingda.
  
  
By making use of [Inventory Interface Information Injector](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85702), it implements new weapon types without causing compatibility issues due to editing SkyUI's SWF files.
  
  
Usage
  
Weapons may be categorized with the new types by assigning them one of these keywords. The FormIDs of the keywords do not matter, but they are case-sensitive.
  
  
WeapTypeSpear
  
WeapTypeJavelin
  
WeapTypePike
  
WeapTypeHalberd
  
WeapTypeRapier
  
WeapTypeQuarterstaff
  
WeapTypeClaw
  
WeapTypeScythe
  
WeapTypeWhip
  
WeapTypeKatana
  
WeapTypeGun
  
  
For example, if you add WeapTypeClaw to a Mace on top of its existing keywords, the I4 config will detect this keyword and display your Mace as a Claw in the inventory, even though it's still fully functional as a Mace and still has its original keywords intact.
