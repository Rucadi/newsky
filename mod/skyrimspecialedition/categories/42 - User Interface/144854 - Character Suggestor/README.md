Do you suffer from Restartitis and have to create new characters so often? This mod adds a button in the character creation screen (called Inspire), clicking it reveals a panel and you can hit Generate button to generate a random character. Press tab or click the button again to hide the panel.
  
  
**What about randomized names?**
