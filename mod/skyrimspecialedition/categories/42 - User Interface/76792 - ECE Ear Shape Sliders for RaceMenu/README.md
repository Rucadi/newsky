**Description**
  
  
[RaceMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19080) already comes with with the CharGen morphs for the [ECE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12302) Slider "Ear Shape".
  
However, in the RaceMenu configuration files these morphs are declared as a slider of the type "Preset".
  
That means the slider behaves like the "Nose Type" or "Eye Shape" sliders.
  
This mod simply adds configuration files to make the different steps of the "Ear Shape﻿" slider available as regular sliders of their own.

The new sliders allow you to freely combine the different ear shapes.
