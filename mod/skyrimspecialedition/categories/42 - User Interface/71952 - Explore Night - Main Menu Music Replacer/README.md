Calm, ominous, relaxing music heard when exploring during the night time, some of my favorite of Skyrim's pieces and definitely helped me sleep some nights! Regular main menu too intense, upbeat or overdone for you? This will be a non-imposing pleasant background experience! I've included a super brief description next to each of them, including their names!
