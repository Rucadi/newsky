Made with the request from [BiggieBoss](https://www.youtube.com/@biggie_boss), this mod adds an item under game's main menu to display Patreon supporters.
  
  
The label of the menu item (default: "My Patreons") can be changed by editing /Interface/Translations files.
  
  
To customize the text inside, override interface/ExtendedCredits\_Patreons.txt file. Similarly the interface background can be customized by overriding interface/Patreons\_bg.dds file.
