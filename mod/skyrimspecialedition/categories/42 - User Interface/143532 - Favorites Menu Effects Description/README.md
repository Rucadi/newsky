A simple add-on for the **Favorites Menu** to display the effects of **Spells**, **Potions**, **Food**, and **Enchanted Weapons** when you select them. No more tedious back-and-forth with the Items and Magic menus to remember what does what. Now you get that information at a glance!
  
The mod will detect if **Survival Mode** is enabled and display the additional survival effects if that's the case.

This mod needs to overwrite any other mod editing "interface\favoritesmenu.swf" to work properly.
  
  
Compatible with widescreen setups by default, but if you are playing on AE1.6.1130+ you will need to install [Widescreen Scale Removed](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/136793).

**Hooch** for the original idea.
  
**SeaSparrow** for relaying that idea to me.
  
**Heloriel** for suggesting the addition of potion descriptions (which then led to food and enchanted weapons).
