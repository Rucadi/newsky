**[size=4]The Dragonborn's Bestiary** is a project I have been wanting to work on for a very long time. If you are like me and love reading the different entries for creatures in games like The Witcher 3, or grabbing lore tidbits in Assassin's Creed's databases, then this one is for you. And if you like to play with resistances mods like Resistances and Weaknesses and the likes, then the Bestiary could come in handy during your adventures.
  
The base mod comes with **122 bestiary entries**, covering all **Vanilla**, **DLC** and **CC** creatures. Add-ons are available as well for mod-added creatures.[/size]

To open the new Bestiary menu, **press K** by default. The hotkey can be changed in the mod's INI file.
  
On the left of the menu, you can browse the different categories and their associated creatures. You can browse this menu either with **keyboard** navigation keys, with the **mouse** or with **joysticks** if using a gamepad.
  
On the top of the menu, you can switch between a creature's **variants** by pressing **Q** and **R**. If you are playing with a gamepad, press **LB** and **RB** to switch between variants. Alternatively, you can also **click** on the arrows next to the variants' names.
  
On the right of the menu, if the description is too long to fit in the text box, a scrolling bar will appear. If you are playing with mouse and keyboard, you can either use the **mouse scroll** or **click and drag** the bar to scroll the text. You can also use the **Page Up** and **Page Down** keys. If you are using a controller, use **LT** and **RT** to scroll the description.

The Bestiary includes a **description** of the creature, along with its potential **loot** as well as its **resistances and weaknesses**. All this information is contained in JSON files and can be easily edited (more about that below).
  
The Bestiary also tracks the number of times you have **killed**, **summoned** or... **transformed** into a creature! The kill counter will always be visible, even when at 0. The summon and transformation counters only appear after they have first been incremented.

Since version 1.3, you can also add the Bestiary to the **System Menu**. In the mod's INI file, change the value of *iEnableSystemMenuOption* to *1* to make the Bestiary option available. Please keep in mind that this will replace the game's Help menu.

There are many ways to unlock a creature's entry in the Bestiary.
  
  

  
* **Killing**: ﻿the most straightforward way to unlock a creature's entry is by slaying them.
**Summoning**: for mages and necromancers alike, this is a convenient and safe way to unlock new entries.
  
* **Transforming**: if you play a Werewolf or Vampire Lord character, you can unlock these creature's entries by transforming.
**Reading**: a good monster hunter is a prepared one. Reading a book about a given creature unlocks its entry, and allows you to learn about its strengths and weaknesses before the fight.
  
* **Interacting**: interact with peaceful animals and pets to unlock their respective entries. No need to hurt the dogs.
**Dialogue**: talking to certain characters will unlock an entry in the bestiary (used once in the base mod for a special creature).
  

  
Once a creature has been unlocked, a widget will appear on the right of your screen to indicate that a new entry is available in the Bestiary. You can adjust the widget's position in the mod's INI file, and also have the option to disable it completely.

If you want to unlock all available entries for debugging, or simply because you are curious, type the following command in the console: *set rpgui\_devmode to 1*

Modularity was at the core of this mod's design from the beginning. **Editing, adding and removing creatures or categories is extremely easy**. Same goes for translating the mod. You can truly tailor the Bestiary to your liking and create add-ons for you favorite mod-added creatures in a convenient way. Most of the edits you make are also displayed at runtime, without the need to restart the game after each change.
  
  
I have written a few **articles** that explain how to do it in detail:

**Mod-added creatures**
  
  
The base mod covers **122 creatures** in total, including the **base game**, **Dawnguard and Dragonborn DLCs** and **all Creation Club add-ons**. You can safely download the full mod even if you don't use all these add-ons, this won't cause any issue.
  
  
**Bestiary Add-Ons** are available at launch for the following mods (under optional files):

Minor conflicts might arise when using add-ons. For example, the base mod comes with an entry for the Zombie, and the Bruma Add-On overwrites it with its own illustration. In such cases, you have to choose which "zombie.dds" you prefer, and let it overwrite the other. Alternatively, instead of overwriting, you can simply delete the illustration you don't want to keep.
  
The same applies for loot and resistances data (in the case of goblins or ogres for example).
  
  
Do not forget to **check the Requirements drop-down** at the top of this mod page to see all the available **add-ons made by the community**[size=3] for the bestiary:

**Resistances mods**[/size]
  
  
The mod will automatically detect if you are using the [Resistances and Weaknesses](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45253) mod and load the appropriate resistances, otherwise it will default to Vanilla configuration. I heavily recommend using the "Resistances and Weaknesses Tweaks" (in this mod's optional files) if you are using that mod. It corrects some inconsistencies and distributes appropriate attributes to CC and several mod-added creatures. The information shown in the Bestiary reflects these changes.
  
  
Additional slots have been created for [Know Your Enemy 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93258) and [Requiem](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60888). The mod automatically detects if one of these is active and loads the appropriate configuration. They weren't made by me, so you can find these patches on their respective pages:
