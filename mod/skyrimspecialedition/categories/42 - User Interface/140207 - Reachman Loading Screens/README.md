A couple years back I spent a good amount of time trying to make a Forsworn overhaul + questline mod before deciding to shelve the project. However, I still really like the loading screens I'd added and the models I'd made for them, so I'm posting them onto here for anyone else who'd be interested. 20 new loading screens, most of which only show within the Reach, which are most of the loading screens I'd made for the mod (I left out the ones describing individual Reachman clans that would've been a part of it)
  
SpoilerThe mod would've had the player help Madanach reestablish the Forsworn by rallying various Reachman clans to his side before a climactic battle to retake Markarth, while also dealing with a renegade clan of Namira-worshipping cannibals that would've spread across the northern Reach and served as enemies. There was also gonna be a post-ending section involving consolidating control and keeping the clans in line, and cleaning up the Warrens. A very cool idea, but sadly I don't have the technical/scripting skill to pull it off to my satisfaction.See more:
