**Skyrim Paper Map by Caro Tuts for FWMF**This is a custom map for [Flat World Map Framework SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29932). It implements [Skyrim World Map](https://www.instagram.com/p/CI3hUsiDmzg/) by [Caro Tuts](https://www.instagram.com/carotillustrations/)﻿ in Map Menu. 
  
  
Some things to know about this map:
  

  
* [size=3]16K resolution, will look good even on 4K screens.
  
There may be very minor deviations between geo and map locations and a few markers, especially for DLCs, can be found behind the detailed part of the map - natural drawn map thing.
  
- Two map textures available - with and without labels for cities and towns.

Flat World Map Framework uses mainly vertical look at map, but allows limited inclination and rotation with held right button as well.
  
INI file with comments included in FWMF allows to tune map control (keyboard, moue and gamepad), possible angles and blur.
  
  
**Requirements**

  
* [FWMF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29932)﻿

  
**Installation**
  
[size=3]The archive is mod manager compatible.
  
  
Install [size=3][FWMF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29932) FOMOD first (Fantasy Paper Maps package preferable). Make sure FMWF is the last in plugins list (only weather fixes or FWMF various patches may be lower), then install this mod normally and place it last in mod order. Legacy version includes patch for SSE Engine fixes, install it if you have this plugin.[/size]

**Compatibility**
  
[size=3]Compatible - SE/AE/GOG (1.6.640 including), but be sure to pick your exact Skyrim version during FWMF FOMOD installation.
  
Not compatible - any map mods except [FMWF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29932).
  
  
[/size]**Recommended Mods**
  
[Atlas Map Markers - Updated with MCM](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24104)﻿ works perfect and smaller markers make map more readable. Just be sure to put Atlas' .esp before FWMF in load order.
  
  
Get along with most UI overhauls. [Dear Diary UI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23010)﻿ and its skins are highly recommended.
  
  
**Known Issues**
  
None so far.
