# Atlas Map Markers Overhaul

Atlas Map Markers is an amazing mod, but most of the location names are taken from the Prima guide, so they often don't match the naming conventions for the rest of Skyrim.
  
  
For Atlas Overhaul, I've visited every map marker added by the original mod and done my best to give it a name more in line with the base game, taking into account the surroundings, events and lore of each location! Locations given names in other Elder Scrolls games have been taken into account, along with some from popular mods. Shops that lacked unique names have been given names. A few new markers have been added for locations I felt the original mod missed.
  
  
The CoMAP icons for Atlas Map Markers, all of the base game and Anniversary Edition have been overhauled. Some CoMAP icons have been repurposed for specific location types, including a few unused icons. Most of the options from CoMAP's FOMOD are built in now, so you don't need to select them.
  
  
Additionally, there are several patches to give certain mods the Atlas Map Markers treatment and CoMAP support! More patches will trickle out as I put my modlist together, keep an eye out if that's something you're interested in!
  
  
You can make requests but I can't guarantee I'll do them if it's not for a mod I plan to use. Feel free to let me know if I missed any markers in the main mod or the supported mods, or ask the reasoning behind any of the new marker names.

**FAQ**:
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
**Q**: "When installing, do I need to disable the Atlas esp from the original mod?"
  
**A**: You don't! Atlas Overhaul is built off of the original, it's not an esp replacer. Let Atlas Overhaul overwrite Atlas and CoMAP (and the Settings Loader, if you use it).
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
**Q**: "What version of Atlas is this compatible with?"
  
**A**: Atlas Overhaul version 1.2 and above is compatible with Atlas version 3.0 and above, you will need to use Atlas Overhaul version 1.1 if you intend to use with Atlas version 2.7.1.
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
**Q**: "I don't use COMAP since the original doesn't require it. I wonder if this would work without COMAP as well?"
  
**A**: It will work, you'll get the new marker names, new map markers, etc., you'll just only have vanilla map marker icons. If that doesn't bother you, go ahead!
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
**Q**: "Why does Honorhall Orphanage use the Dark Brotherhood marker?"
  
**A**: I don't know what you're talking about, that's just a perfectly innocent hand print one of the orphans did in fingerpainting.
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
**Q**: "Could you explain why you renamed Shrine of Talos (in Riften) to Ruby of Riften?"
  
**A**: Queen Barenziah was active in Riften during her youth; she had connections to Tiber Septim, and the Ruby Throne is the name of the Emperor's throne. It was my idea that the Talos shrine in Riften is there specifically because of this, so they'd taken to calling it the Ruby of Riften!
  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
**Q**: "Will you make a patch for Compass Navigation Overhaul?"
  
**A**: I don't personally use that mod, so I'm not entirely sure what needs to be patched. I won't be making a patch myself, but if one is provided to me, I'm happy to host it in the FOMOD (with credit!) or provide a link to it.
