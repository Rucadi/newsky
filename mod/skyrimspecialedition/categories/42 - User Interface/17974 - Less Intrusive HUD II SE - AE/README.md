**OVERVIEW**
  
  
Less Intrusive HUD II allows you to tweak pretty much every element in the vanilla HUD and it does so **IN GAME** !
  
No separate .txt files, no more going in/out game to check your setting.
  
Optional : Use **FISSES** to save your settings for another playthrough.
  
  
This Gopher video will show you what this mod does :
  
  
  
And here's a small but great one from Michael from GamerPoets
  
  
  
**VERSION 1.1.44**
  
Changes/Fixes
  
- Ported to SSE with permission by **Dark Dominion**.
  
  
**IMPORTANT NOTE:**
  
skse64 and MCM Menu ( SkyUI 5.2SE ) are required to use this mod.
  
  
**COMPATIBILITY**
  
- Highly recommended to use **Immersive HUD II**by **Gopher** for additional HUD tweaks, behaviors and toggle options.
  
  
**INCOMPATIBILITIES:**
  
- Any mod that modifies the **hudmenu.swf** / **hudmenu.gfx** file
  
- Colored markers are ok, as long as the changes are made in **map.swf**
  
- Still the compass markers are inside the hudmenu file, so **colored compass markers is not an option**.
  
  
**FAQ:**
  
**Q.** *How can I move elements in the HUD faster?*
  
**A.** **Press the . key on your NumPad, it will change the stepping from 0.5, 1.0, 10.0 unit**s
  
  
**Q.** *Is there a way to save a preset to use with another character*
  
**A**. **yes, Use the FISSES optional file**
  
  
**Q.** *My computer does not have a NumPad, can I still use this mod?*
  
**A.** **Yes you can, there is an option to remap the keys, look for it in the advanced tab.**
  
  
**Optional Files:**
  
- FISS/FISSES Compatibility to save settings
  
  
**INSTALLATION**
  
Use a Mod Manager ( Vortex, NMM, MO... )
  
Or, download and place both the .esp and .bsa files in your Skyrim data folder.
  
If you are also installing any of the optional modification files, copy those files in your Skyrim data folder keeping the file structure.
  
  
**USAGE**
  
This mod uses fixed keys for editing the HUD, those keys are all located in the **NumPad of your keyboard**.
  
  
There is a predefined **PRESET** defined by me that you can use if you don't wanna mess with every single HUD element yourself.
  
Just go to the menu and select the option **LOAD PRESET**
  
Some other options are self explanatory and are located in the MCM menu, such as transparencies and optional variants of HUD elements.
  
 
  
( **REMEMBER all the keys are located in the NUMPAD** ) 
  
To ENTER EDIT MODE hit <**ENTER**> on your NumPad keyboard  --> ***This is the only key that can be customized in the MCM menu.***
  
To SELECT the element to be modified cycle through using the **/** and **\*** keys (Previous / Next element)
  
To MOVE the elements use the **arrow** keys (Up, Down, Left and Right. **Not** the NumPad arrows keys)
  
To SCALE items use **+** and **-** keys
  
To change the amount of INCREASE / DECREASE value hit the **.** key (Values 0.5, 1 and 10 units)
  
To ROTATE or change TEXT ALIGNMENT use the **9** key -- > ***Some elements support this options, some others don't***
  
To SAVE the changes and EXIT EDIT MODE hit <**ENTER**> again in your NumPad
  
  
**UNINSTALLATION**
  
**Disable the mod in-game**, save your game and remove all the files installed by this mod
  
Reload your game and the HUD should be back to vanilla
  
  
**BUGS / ISSUES**
  
Sometimes when you use the alternative sneak crosshair once you load your game, you may notice the crosshair shows up even when not sneaking.
  
To fix that you can simply crouch and stand-up and it will fix itself.
  
If for any reason the alternative crosshair isn't showing, try re-checking the option on the MCM menu.
