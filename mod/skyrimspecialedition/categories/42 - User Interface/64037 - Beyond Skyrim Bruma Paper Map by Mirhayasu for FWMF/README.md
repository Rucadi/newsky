**Beyond Skyrim: Bruma Paper Map by Mirhayasu for FWMF**This is a custom map for [Flat World Map Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29932). It implements Bruma map by [Mirhayasu](https://www.deviantart.com/mirhayasu) in Map Menu. 
  
  
Some things to know about this map:

  
* Map is more geo precise and more detailed than Duncan's Bruma map.
Best FWMF package for this map is  "FWMF for Fantasy Paper Maps", it renders colors closest to original. 
  
* Map texture has ~8K resolution.

**Requirements**

  
* [FWMF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29932)﻿

  
**Installation**
  
[size=3]The archive is mod manager compatible.
  
  
Install [size=3][FWMF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29932) FOMOD first (Fantasy Paper Maps package preferable). Make sure FMWF is the last in plugins list (only weather fixes or FWMF various patches may be lower), then install this mod normally and place it last in mod order.
  
  
[/size]Make sure Flat Map Markers config file (FlatMapMarkersSSE.json) has this part:
  
  
> *},
>   
>  {
>   
>  "name": "Tamriel",
>   
>  "editorID": "BSHeartland",
>   
>  "markerHeight": 180000,
>   
>  "enabled": true
>   
>  },*

  
If you experience issues with the map called from the north edge of the map (vanilla 3D map visibility) make sure to either set FOV higher than 80 or use [Baka World Map FOV](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/132177) setting in FWMF FOMOD with value higher than 80.
  
  
Also make sure you have 'Make Map Strictly Vertical' option in FWMF MCM.
  
[/size]**Compatibility**
  
[size=3]Compatible - Skyrim SE/AE/GOG (1.6.640 including), but be sure to pick your exact Skyrim version during FWMF FOMOD installation.
  
Not compatible - any map mods except [FMWF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29932).
  
  
[/size]**Recommended Mods**
  
[Atlas Map Markers - Updated with MCM](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24104)﻿ works perfect and smaller markers make map more readable. Just be sure to put Atlas' .esp before FWMF in load order.
  
  
Get along with most UI overhauls. [Dear Diary UI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23010)﻿ and its skins are highly recommended.
  
  
**Known Issues**
  
None.
