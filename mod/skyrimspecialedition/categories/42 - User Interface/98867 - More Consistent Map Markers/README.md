When you compare Skyrim‘s user interface you will quickly realize one thing: The UI is hell out of date. There are many mods which aim to fix that. (Looking at Untarnished UI or the not yet released Edge UI.
  
  
This mod takes another attempt. It fixes a problem not seen by the broad mass yet. Looking at other games, skyrim‘s map marker arts are very varied and there is not really a consistent design.

This mod aims to „fix“ that problem and introduces a completely new design attempt while also bringing more consistency to your game.

Overall, you do have 2 major options using my map markers:
  
1. Full version: Uses the full amount of map markers used in the vanilla game. Optional Comap Compatibility
  
2. Simplified version: Reduces the amount of map marker designs.

**Installation**
  
1. Uninstall every instance of Nexus Mods Manager
  
2. Install a good mod manager (MO2 or Vortex)
  
3. Install the mod using one of those mod managers and follow the fomod instructions.
  
4. Enjoy
  
  
**Features**
  
- HIgh quality custom made map markers
  
- consistent design covering every single map marker
  
- plenty of patches for other mods
  
- optional shrinked version which reduces the amount of vanilla map markers.
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
Fully compatible:
  
- SkyUI
  
- SkyHUD (patch provided)
  
- Compass Navigation Overhaul (patch provided)
  
  
- NORDIC UI (external Patch)
  
  
  
- COMAP (patch coming soon)
  
  
\*generally, any UI mod that edits something on the ingame compass will require a patch to correctly show the UI mod‘s compass and the new map marker design made by me. I will try creating enough patches for upcoming UI mods. If I missed something just point it out in the comments section.
  
  
Incompatible:
  
- every mod that does edits to map markers and is not strictly introduced as „compatible“
  
- Atlas Map markers, in fact, is compatible. But some icons may appear too large or too small. I am going to include an optional ini which attempts to fix that.
