**Nordic UI - SkyUILib patch**This was bother me a lot after switching from other UI's. Couldn't find a patch around and since some mods use those sfw files (nether follower framework, Skyrim Unbound Reborn, etc), I did a little patch for it. 
  
  
  
For the people who doesn't know about what are these files:
  
SpoilerCustom files used by other mods for new menus. SkyUILib is called. Some one of them like Unbound Reborn, Nether Follower Framework or The Welkynar Knight - Quest and others. 
  
  
I just adapted those .sfw files with Nordic UI style.
