**Description**
  
  
Predictable Persuasion makes all speech challenges (persuasion, intimidation, and bribes) in Skyrim more predictable by showing the required speech level to persuade the target, the calculated outcome, and the predicted response, accounting for perks and whether the player is wearing the [Amulet of Articulation](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Amulet_of_Articulation). What information and how exactly it is displayed, can be configured in the [INI file](https://github.com/JonathanFeenstra/PredictablePersuasion/blob/main/config/PredictablePersuasion.ini). Since the information is dynamically gathered instead of hard-coded, no compatibility patches are required for other mods that add new speech challenges. This SKSE plugin was developed with [CommonLibSSE NG](https://github.com/CharmedBaryon/CommonLibSSE-NG) to support Skyrim SE, AE, and VR.
