Tired of rummaging through your items to find what the courier just delivered? Not anymore!
  
  
This mod displays the names of delivered items. No required ESPs, no container or quest edits. One optional ESP (flagged ESL) if you want animations during the exchange. Works for 1st and 3rd person POV. Compatible with SSE and AE. Versions for vanilla, Provincial Courier Service, and Better Courier. Patch available for Loot and Degradation's tempered item deliveries. Choose your preferred text color in the FOMOD installer (green, red, or white).
  
  
  
  
**Requirements:**

  
* **Requires SKSE** because I use a couple of SKSE functions in the script.

  
**Fully Compatible:**
  

  
* Provincial Courier Service (available on www.afkmods.com)
[Loot and Degradation](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21744) (for its tempered item deliveries)
  
* [Better Courier](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40709) (Better Courier has its own animations, so the FOMOD disables the animations install if Better Courier is detected). NOTE: As of version 1.8.1 of Better Courier you no longer really need this mod because Better Courier shows you what you receive in its inventory window. This even works for Skyrim Souls users since that compatibility is now built into Better Courier. But if you still want the messages to appear in the upper left of your window, you can still use this mod. It is compatible with the last couple versions of Better Courier, including version 2.1.1.
[The Courier Crew](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61400) (The Courier Crew has its own animations, so the FOMOD disables the animations install if The Courier Crew is detected)﻿
  
* [Courier Delivers to NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42928)﻿ (compatible out of the box)
[Skald's Mail - A Courier Alternative](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31791) (compatible out of the box)
  
* Compatible with all courier appearance overhauls, such as [Dapper Deliveries - A Courier Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64057)﻿, [Immersive Courier](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32392)﻿, [The Handsome Courier SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30579)﻿,  etc.
Any mod that doesn't touch the wicourierscript.pex file is compatible
  

  
**[b]How does this work?**
  
[/b]

  
* I simply added conditional debug.notification statements to the wicourierscript.psc script which is the vanilla script that runs when the courier hands you items.

**Recommended Mods:**
  

  
* [Advanced Notification Log NG](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67975)﻿:Caches notification messages, so you can look at them later in the MCM.
