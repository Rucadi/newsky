Up until now, I4 didn't fully work in the Alchemy Menu, because keywords were never available to match against in that menu. This lead to some unsatisfying missing icons when using mods like [Aura's Inventory Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68557), [Kome's Inventory Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/116713), and other mods that changed ingredient icons. I am now happy to provide this fix!
  
  
  
  
**Installation & Version Support**
  
  
**Requires [the original](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85702) mod.** This only replaces the SKSE plugin.
  
This mod supports the same Skyrim versions as the original, meaning:
  

  
* "AE" main file: Compatible with Skyrim Special Edition 1.6.318–1.6.1170 (Steam) and 1.6.659–1.6.1179 (GOG).
VR main file: Compatible with Skyrim VR 1.4.15.1.
  

  
If you're using Skyrim Special Edition 1.5.97, **don't download this mod**, and instead use [Inventory Interface Information Injector for Skyrim 1.5](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/87002), which has this fix included as of uploading this mod. You may need to update it if you're already using it to get the fix.﻿
