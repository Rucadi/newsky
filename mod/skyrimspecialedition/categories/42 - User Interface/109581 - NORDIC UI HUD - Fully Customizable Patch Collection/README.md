After updating Oxygen Meter 2 to version 1.0.6 and running the game for the first time, OxygenMeter2.ini gets generated in the Mod Manager's overwrite folder.
  
***TO SEE THIS MOD'S EFFECT, PLEASE DELETE THE AUTO-GENERATED OxygenMeter2.ini FROM OVERWRITE FOLDER!***

[font=Trebuchet MS]Overview[/font]
  
  
[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]A FOMOD provides you with options to let you customize NORDIC UI to your taste:
  
  
Depending on which Preset you've chosen, Health, Stamina, and Magicka bars are stacked together at the upper left or the lower left of your screen.
  
Extra bars, such as ***Oxygen Meter 2***and ***Casting Bar***, can be placed both above or below the main three bars; since in vanilla Skyrim you can't attack underwater, you don't need both bars at the same time.
  
  
This lets you reposition them above the health bar for three reasons:
  
1. By default, the space under the stamina bar is reserved for weapon enchants and other widgets like [Edryu's Widget - Nordic...ish Preset](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/75446).
  
2. Priority-wise, it makes more sense because the character's health decreases only after the oxygen is fully depleted.
  
3. Aesthetically, it fills the upper gap perfectly.
  
  
There are different options included in case you need extra bars to appear at the same time. If you use mods that unlock the ability to attack underwater, you may prefer to replace one of the additional bars below the main three to keep track of all at once.[/font]

[font=Trebuchet MS]Compatibility[/font]
  
  
[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]To maintain visual consistency, I highly recommend installing [Casting Bar HUD Variance](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80691) (Nordic, obviously). Although these skins are not perfectly matched with NORDIC UI in detail (e.g. the angle of pointy ends), I've done my best to shape them as accurately as possible.
  
Not being hard requirements, with the mentioned mods, I made sure all the bars were equal in the number of pixels.
  
  
**IMPORTANT NOTE**
  
Oxygen Meter 2 has been updated to v1.0.6!
  
The Master files got renamed from "po3\_oxygenMeter2" to "oxygenMeter2" which makes it incompatible with .swf replacer mods.
