I really like the added features of [A Clear Map of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56367?tab=description). However, I also really like the Skyrim map weather as it is set up with [NAT III ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27141?tab=description&BH=2). This patch simply merges the added visibility and increased worldspace size of A Clear Map of Skyrim with the map weather of NAT III ENB. This will work with both the regular and No Clouds version.
  
  
Make sure that the patch loads after both A Clear Map of Skyrim and NAT III ENB. The order of the other two plugins shouldn't matter.
  
  
I *did not* run DynDOLOD  or ACMOS in the images included though it should be fine if you do assuming you follow the instructions given on A Clear Map of Skyrim's mod page.
  
  
I am unsure if this will be compatible with the Worldspace Transition Tweaks patch or not. Eventually, I do plan to add this to my load order, but I can't be bothered to run xLodGen and DynDOLOD until I am ready to actually start my next playthrough.
  
  
Let me know if there are any issues with the WTT patch if you use it.
  
  
Oh and it is esl flagged.

This isn't really the type of mod I usually upload; I usually upload gameplay oriented mods, specifically Magic as of late. So check those out in my profile if ya want.
