This is a simple plug and play mod to overhaul the text font in the game.
  
  
I found the vanilla Skyrim font to be too garish for me, so I went hunting for a font overhaul. However, not many font overhauls are available, and the ones that were didn't really peak my interest.
  
  
That was until I stumbled upon the [Untarnished UI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/75188) mod. This mod features the Futura Book BT font, which is clean and stunning. However, to get that font, you needed to install that mod alongside another mod, [Dear Diary Dark Mode](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60837)﻿. Now, both of these mods are amazing together, but installing within a pre-existing modlist that already has a UI overhaul can be a pain.
  
  
With that being said, I decided to just make a standalone mod that only touches upon the font elements without causing issues for any other mods (*i hope*).
  
  
There will be two files available to download within the file tab, please note, you only need to install one of them.
  

  
* **ALL Font Futura Book BT**

﻿This file will overhaul every text element. Including books and notes.
  
  

  
* **UI Font Futura Book BT**

﻿This file will overhaul only the UI text elements. **NOT** books and notes.
  
  
I decided to provide two separate downloads for people who want to maintain some level of immersion by leaving the books and notes with the vanilla handwritten style of font. However, for me personally, I like to be able to skim books and notes quickly, so I prefer those texts to be overhauled too.
  
  
  
**Installation**Installation should be as simple as just dropping it into whatever mod manager you are using. Personally, i'm using [Mod Organiser 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194)﻿.
  
I would recommend placing the mod somewhat higher in your load order to allow other mods to overwrite whatever fonts they need to.
  
Note: If installing into a pre-existing mod list, make sure to disable any other font mods within your mod manager.
  
  
**Side note!**I made this mod with a 1440p display in mind. It works flawlessly on my system. However, that means it's not tested on any other common resolutions. I don't see why it would be problematic though, so let me know if there are any issues.
