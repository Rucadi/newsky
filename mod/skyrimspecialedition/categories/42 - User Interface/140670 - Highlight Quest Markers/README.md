Do you find yourself looking at the map, and not find the quest markers? The trick I used to use was to drag the map across and find when the marker would stick to the side of the screen to eventually find it. That's awful! This mod makes it so you can press the **Shout** key while you're in map, and it will create a ping (inspired by the Breath of the Wild game) to where all your quest markers are, bringing them to focus.
