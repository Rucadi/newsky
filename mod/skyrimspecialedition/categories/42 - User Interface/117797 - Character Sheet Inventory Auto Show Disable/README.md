This change is accomplished by editing the SkyrimCharacterSheet\_Input.json file. Specifically, Line 31 (inventory\_auto\_show\_inventory) is changed to false. Feel free to edit the file yourself or just download this and ensure it loads after Skyrim Character Sheet. You can also press, by default, the zero key (on the main keyboard, not the number pad) to toggle display of this UI while in inventory.
