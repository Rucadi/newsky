This mod retextures the Elven armor set, shield and weapons, Thalmor Robes, Snow elf armor, auriel's shield and bow, CC Elven Hunter (including the restored helmet from the unofficial patch), CC Elite crossbow's Elven crossbow, CC Horse armor - elven's horse armor and CC The cause's Ayleid wights and lich. Also contains optional retextures for many mods such as Sentinel, Amidianborn content addon, bosmer armor pack, Oblivion artifacts pack SE, and more!
  
  
The textures for the Elven armor are based on [Cabal120's aMidianBorn Book of Silence](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35382)﻿. I used their normal maps as a base to create my retexture. Every other textures are based on vanilla normal maps
  
Works with every mod that also works with vanilla Elven textures, such as Heavy armory, Animated armory, etc.
  
  
  
Fomod lets you pick and choose what you want. 
  
  
Textures are 2k except Chest armor textures, which are 4k.
  
  
Half-res version available in Optional files (Chest, weapons and shields are 2k, everything else is 1k)
  
Low-res version is available in optional files (chest, weapons and shields are 1k, everything else is 1k)

Use this option is you use the mods [Amidianborn content addon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35390)﻿ or [Sentinel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/100985)﻿. It will make the elven armor use the gold textures and the thalmor armor use the black textures. The gilded elven and gilded thalmor armors added by these mods do not use unique textures. They use the same textures as the regular and thalmor versions, but swap the cubemap for a golden one. Which means this option will affect their look too.
