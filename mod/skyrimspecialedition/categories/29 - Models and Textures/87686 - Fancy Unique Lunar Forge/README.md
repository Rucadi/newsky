This mod gives the Lunar Forge at Silent Moons Camp in Whiterun Hold a unique model using ENB lights and some tweaks and additions. There are no gameplay changes, only the forge model and textures.
  
  
  
  
A huge thanks goes to [wSkeever](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/7064860) and his [Animated Forge Water](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52322) whose base forge model I used for this mod :) The water is just amazing. And another thanks goes to  [ElSopa](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/6960827) for permitting me to make the patch for [HD Medieval Anvil](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48825), because I couldn't go without this mod. And one more thanks to [skyrimmods](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5182225) for their ENB Light nodes :)
  
  
And last but not least, another huge thanks goes to [mindflux](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/3211380) for allowing me the use of their assets for [Embers XD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37085) and the gorgeous coals in forges. 
  
  
  
  
  
**Options**
  
  
There are options for the full ENB Light blast as well as one with lowered intensity.
  
There is also an option for you if you're using [ElSopa's](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/6960827) amazing [HD Medieval Anvil](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48825)model. If you use the mod and don't install this version, your anvil texture will be messed up. This version requires ElSopa's Medieval Anvil for the textures.
  
And finally, there is an option to use the forge coals from [Embers XD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37085) by [mindflux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3211380). Embers XD is not required, but I highly recommend the mod regardless.
  
  
  
  
  
**Installation/Uninstallation**
  
  
Install
  
Just install with your mod manager. It's a FOMOD. If you want to install it manually, the folder structure should be pretty straightforward.
  
  
Uninstall
  
I think it's safe to uninstall anytime since it only changes the model of this one particular mod. No guarrantees though, so don't blame me if something gets messed up when you uninstall it mid-game. 
  
  
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
  
This mod should be compatible with anything that does not outright create a new model for the Lunar Forge specifically. 
  
  
Compatible with [Serenity - A Silent Moons Camp Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30019) (you might need to have my mod loaded after it though) and [Silent Moons Camp](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/111465)
  
A patch is available for [New Armory Series - Lunar Weapons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69438) (huge thanks to [DrMonops](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/DrMonops) for updating the patch and providing it :) )﻿
  
A patch is available for [Watchman's Silent Moons Camp](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/129824). The patch replaces the forge with the blue flame with the one from this mod.
  
  
**﻿
  
F.A.Q.**
  
  
The coals don't look that great.
  
The original don't... right. I'm just not that talented with this. But I highly recommend that you all use the Embers XD version instead with highly superior coals.
  
  
The light looks more/less intense for me.
  
It depends on your ENB preset. That's why there's two options for you to choose from with the light. 
  
  
Can you make it a different color?
  
Actually yes. Let me know if you want me to.
  
  
ESPFE?
  
Yes, of course, all the plugins are eslified already :)
