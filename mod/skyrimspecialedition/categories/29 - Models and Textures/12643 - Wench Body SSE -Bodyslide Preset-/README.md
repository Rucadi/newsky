Since several people asked me about what Bodytype/preset i was using in the pics i uploaded in my immersive wenches mod, i decided to share it too.
  
  
  
I tried to combine a natural look + fantasy, avoiding a silicone look and increasing sagginess depending on the weights, thats the idea, the scale is from a hourglass bodytype to a thick and voluptuous body.

-The file contains 3 presets: one for naked body one to use with clothes/armor and one for bikinis, the difference is clothes preset has   cleavage, pushup, breasts are a little higher and size of nipples are reduced to avoid clipping.
  
  
-In version 2.0 the breasts, legs, thighs and areolas are a little bigger. The max weight was used in the gifs. weight 0 is the same as in version 1.0 with minor tweaks. Also the gifs were created while using skyrim LE and the physics may not be the same in SE like the "sagginess" of the breasts.
  
  
-If you find some issues with some outfits try to change these sliders and reduce their values:
  
  
   -DoubleMelon (can cause clipping on the chest)
  
   -Chubby butts (can cause clipping on the butt)
  
   -Areolas (can cause clipping near the nipples)
  
  
-Weight 80 or 100 may clip in some armor depending if they were made for big proportions in mind.
  
  
-Lorefriendlyness depends on the weight of the NPC or your point of view, you decide. But the middle weights 40 or 60 can help to give you   an idea to build your own bodytype from there if you want to edit the preset.

REQUIRED MODS:

I assume you know how to use Bodyslide and how to use this preset to generate a body type depending on what you are using.
  
  
In any case you can google for tutorials or just check bodyslide mod page, since just generating bodies is the easiest thing to do.
  
  
Anyway i hope you like it or it helps you. :D
