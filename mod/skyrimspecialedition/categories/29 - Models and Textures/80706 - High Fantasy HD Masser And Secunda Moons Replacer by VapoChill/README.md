**30th April 2024: I am *finally* working on an update to solve the clipped edges issue and improve compatibility with tools like ENB. Thank you for your patience.
  
  
I got frustrated with the lack of good moon mods or retextures on the nexus so decided to create my own.**A lot of the other options either have horrible textures, lots of artifacting, or no moon phases.
  
As it turns out, it takes a lot more effort than expected to create good moons!**Features:**
  

  
* Working moon phases like skyrim's vanilla moons.
Moon's clouds change a little bit depending on moon phase.
  
* 4K Twinkly twinkly stars replacer - *more than 4K is pointless because the stars tile anyway*
2K BC7 Moon Textures
  

  
Install with fomod or copy+paste like any other texture mod.
  
**Not necessary but recommended:**
  
  
If you want high fantasy galaxy look: [8K Night Skies - Stars and Galaxies - Cathedral Concept](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20301)
  
If you want a more realistic look with no galaxy: [Earthly Night Sky by Wofrion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78604)﻿
  
If you want shooting stars (which match my stars well): [Shooting Stars SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73090)﻿ + [Shooting Stars HD Textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74524)
  
  
Overwrite your choice of the above mods with mine.
  
  
If you want to change the individual sizes of your Moons/Planets use this mod: [Moon Size Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/1037)﻿*(It's an oldrim mod but it still works on 1.5.97 & 1.6.659. Personally I believe 70-80% looks best!)*
  
  
I mostly run 4K textures but these Moon & Planet textures are in 2K because the moons are quite small, anything more than 4K is effectively pointless & this size comes with zero vRAM or performance cost despite looking amazing on a 4K monitor.
  
  
Note; Screenshots taken with vanilla skyrim engine, NO reshade, ENB, lighting mods, etc.
  
Not tested with ENB so I don't know how the brightness will be.
  
  
P.S: This is my first ever mod so please leave a comment if you like it or have feedback.
  
Enjoy.
