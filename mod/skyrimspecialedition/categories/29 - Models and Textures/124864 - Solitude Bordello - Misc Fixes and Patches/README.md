Just a handful of small patches and fixes for the Crimson Corner - Solitude Bordello mod that I made for my own playthrough. I'll probably continue adding additional patches to this mod page. If I get enough patches I'll consider adding a fomod version with an auto-patcher, but for now that's a bit overkill :)
  
  
Files included:
  
  

  
* **Solitude Bordello - Redbag's Solitude Trees Patch:**

﻿Moves a single tree out of the way so it isn't protruding through the building.
  
  

  
* **Solitude Bordello - SLaWF Patch:**

﻿﻿Deletes a few hidden objects inside of the Bordello building that you can't see, as well as a mountain flower plant that ﻿ ﻿protrudes through the exterior entrance stairs.
  
  

  
* **Solitude Bordello - Bug Fixes:**

﻿Fixes a really obvious z-fighting issue on steps to the bard's stage.
