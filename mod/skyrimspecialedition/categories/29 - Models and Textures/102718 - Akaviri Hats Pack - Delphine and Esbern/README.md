In the vanilla game, when reaching a certain point in the main story ([The Throat of the World](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Throat_of_the_World)), both Delphine and Esbern will change from their starterl outfits to a new, permanent one. Delphine wears a helmetless Blades armor set (*ArmorBladesOutfitNoHelmet [OTFT:00108DBE]*), while Esbern changes to the [Mourner's Clothes](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Mourner%27s_Clothes) (*EsbernSkyHavenOutfit [OTFT:00109123]*).
  
  
My mod makes a minor tweak to both of those outfits to utilize hats from [Akaviri Hats Pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/83975?tab=files).
  
  
**FEATURES**
  

  
* Delphine will wear the Clothing version of the Akaviri Hat - Blades upon changing to her Blades armor.
Esbern will wear the Clothing version of the Akaviri Straw Hat upon changing to his Mourner's Clothes.
  

  
**INSTALLATION**

  
* Download and install [Akaviri Hats Pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/83975)
Download and install my mod ﻿with your preferred mod manager.
  

  
**KNOWN ISSUES**
  

  
* They will still wear their hat when going to sleep. I guess they really love their hat.
No other vanilla NPCs use those outfits, but modded ones might, so if they do, they'll also get the hat. Whether that's an issue may depend on the user.
  

  
**COMPATIBILITY**

  
* Not compatible with any mods modifying the two outfit records I touched.
