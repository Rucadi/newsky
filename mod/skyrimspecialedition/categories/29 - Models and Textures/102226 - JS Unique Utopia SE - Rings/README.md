**FAQ:**
  
  
1) Why is there an .esp? I thought this was just a replacer?
  
• Some rings do not have a unique model in vanilla skyrim, for example, most of the rings use a generic ring model template.
  
  
2) Another mod out there changes the stats of one of the weapons in the esp!
  
• These changes will need to be carried forward either in a separate patch or the model path will need to be changed in that particular mod to match this mod. Let me or that mod author know about it.
  
  
3) You forgot x ring / You didn't include any CC rings
  
[color=#b6b6b6][size=2]• I left out any ring that I didn't feel needed to be included, such as the rings that are part of the Daedric Gauntlet. CC Rings I may add in the future (I still don't have it)[/size][/color]
  
  
4) There is clipping with some random glove
  
• Can't be avoided
