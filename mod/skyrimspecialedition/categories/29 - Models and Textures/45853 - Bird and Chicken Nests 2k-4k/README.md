Adds 2-4k nest textures and vanilla meshes. Uses BC7. First time trying. Works in game, not sure it will work in LE so I wouldn't try.
  
NO ESP. Install and activate.
  
  
[color=#00ffff]Compatable with mods like [chicken butt hurt minimizer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/72866/?tab=files). As long as the mod still uses the vanilla mesh and not a completely new mesh that isn't based on vanilla, this mod will work. Just don't let the nif files in this mod overwrite that mod.
  
  
\*Hawk nests from Hearthfire added after main files were uploaded. Please download and install under optional downloads.
  
  
[/color]2/20/2021 update:
  
In updated eggs, the top and bottom of egg get a wierd shadow seam when tilting the egg in lighting. They look fine in nests. I don't want to bloat this mod with too many files trying to work over and over on this mod.
  
If you prefer the other eggs but have issues with them looking rough. Please download optional file that gives you new Normal files that smooth the texture of egg.
  
  
I normally use DX5 but since I got adobe CC I gave BC7 a shot. I admit I'm new with it so any tips are welcome. I don't think these textures will work in Oldrim and I won't be making it for oldrim since I only mod for SE. If anyone wants to convert it, just message me.
  
  
Hope you guys like it. I don't see a noticeable difference with 4k even though I upscaled it there first. Most shots were using 4k but I personally downscaled to 2k. Then again, I don't have a 4k monitor. xD

I don't know a way around fixing this. The texture is seamless but the file uses 2 sides of the egg. When light is off, egg looks fine. I feel it's more of a nif issue. If you can't stand the slight seam. You can use original nests.
