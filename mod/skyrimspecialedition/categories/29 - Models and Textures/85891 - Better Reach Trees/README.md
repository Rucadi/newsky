# Better Reach Trees
- Author: ICFur
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85891


This is a mesh and texture replacement for reach trees, reach branch piles, and the reach stump that keeps the vanilla mesh footprint. The textures have been replaced with textures made from images I took of a Easter Red Cedar tree.
  
  
**What's been Changed?**
  

  
* Completely new textures available in 2k and 4k
The new textures use their own unique path so they will not interfere with other meshes that used parts from the original reach tree
  
* Mesh fixes for the vanilla meshes. Fixes include re-mapping the texture to the mesh and resolving some irregularities in the meshes (overlapping faces, oddly protruding sections of the tree, etc.)
These are not high poly meshes and should have almost the same poly count as the vanilla mesh. Some meshes may have slightly more or less polys depending on what needed to be done to fix mesh issues, but it should not have any impact on performance.
  
* These keep the same footprint as the vanilla Reach Tree meshes, so you should not encounter moss left hanging in the air or trees that come out of the mountains sideways unless they were already like that in the vanilla game or you have a mod that changes the position of the moss/trees.
As of Version 1.01: Parallax meshes and texture are available for all meshes, option to use mod along side Happy Little Trees is available, and a 3D LOD option is available for Happy Little Trees
