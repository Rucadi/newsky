This mod retextures all 5 variants of the Dawnguard Armor, the dawnguard shield, rune shield, waraxe, warhammer, rune axe and rune warhammer. Also contains an optional retexture for the Dawnguard Sword, Elite sword, dagger, elite dagger and scabbard added by [Dawnguard Arsenal SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25094)﻿. If you are looking for the crossbow, it is part of my: [Steel Armors and Weapons Retexture SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85445)﻿
  
  
The rune weapons are compatible with the amazing flaming version added by [Frankly HD Dawnguard Armor and Weapons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19663). Simply load my retexture after to get my weapon textures with the fire effect added on top. (more info below)﻿
  
  
  
  
Works with every mod that also works with vanilla textures, such as Heavy armory.

Optional retextures for mods I enjoy. They are meant to help add consistency in your game, but are completely optional.

**COMPATIBILITY WITH FRANKLY HD DAWNGUARD ARMOR AND WEAPONS
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/B8siIEP.jpg)**FrankFamily has an excellent retexture of the dawnguard armors and weapons. I do not claim mine to be better, but I hope it can be seen as another good option. One thing that Frank Family added that I really love is the fire effect around the rune hammer and rune axe. Thankfully, this effect is completely compatible with my retexture. You can simply load my retexture after Frank Family's the the weapons will look like the screenshot above. However, I recommend deleting the following folder, from Frankly HD Dawnguard: Meshes/DLC1/Armor. I based my textures on the vanilla meshes, so the added cubemaps by Frankly HD to the light sets will make my textures look different than my screenshots (the matte painted plates on the chest will look reflective)
