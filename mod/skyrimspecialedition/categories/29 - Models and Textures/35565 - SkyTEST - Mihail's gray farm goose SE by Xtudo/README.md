**SkyTEST's goose replaced with the Mihail's gray farm version**
  
**by Xtudo**

**Description**
  
For me, the SkyTEST's geese are too white and bright.
  
This little patch replaces them with the Mihail's gray farm version.
  
  
**Optional file added:** **SkyTEST's geese lower idle sound** LE/SE v1.0.
  
This patch will reduce the volume of the "quack" idle sound of the SkyTEST geese. For me it's better now, recommended!
