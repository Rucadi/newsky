I can't find any mods that change that. If there is, forgive me.
  
  
This FYX will work with anything, but it's made to be consistent with mods that add 3D coal on top of 2D coal heaps like [High Poly Project (HPP)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12029) and [WeldingMans Smelter with ENB Light](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74816)
  
  
- Replaces the 2D coal that appears in shovels with a 3D model
  
- Adds a new optional texture
  
- Version for **[ElSopa - HD Iron Tools Redone SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60495)**
  
  
Enjoy !
  
  
Choose only one file **A)** for Vanilla Shovel or **B)** for ElSopa Shovel
