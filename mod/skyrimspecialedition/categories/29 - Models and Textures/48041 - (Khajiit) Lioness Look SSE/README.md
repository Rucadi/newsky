This is a port of the LE mod (Khajiit) Lioness Look by [OBLbeginner](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/4711524)I really like this mod so I got the original author's permission to port it to SSE!  
  
I can't offer any support because I am only porting this mod and know little to nothing about making mods!
  
  
  
Original Mod Here:
  
  
[(Khajiit) Lioness Look](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/92001?tab=description)
  
  
  
What this mod does:
  
  
This mod retextures the female khajiit to look like a lioness.
  
You need the mod Khajiit Overhaul in order to use the lioness head mesh however﻿, otherwise it will only retexture the female khajiit!
  
This mod works for CBBE and UNP
  
  
  
Installation:
  
  
First:
  
- Install [Khajiit Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48223?tab=description) by [NightroModzz](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/33885745)
  
- You can still use CBBE despite this mod saying it requires UNP because the lioness mod comes with CBBE textures.
  
  
  
Second:
  
- Install this mod
  
- To get the lioness head, look in the head section of racemenu and find the faceparts section and flip to the lioness head.
  
- If installing the My Edit version, this may cause a neck seam but it is easily concealable and honestly not that bad. It's only visible on the back of the neck.
  
- If you want the body normalmaps I'm using that make khajiit look furrier, the files are in my guide linked below
  
  
  
For those that don't want to use Khajiit Overhaul this will only retexture the female khajiit and will not give you the lioness head!﻿
