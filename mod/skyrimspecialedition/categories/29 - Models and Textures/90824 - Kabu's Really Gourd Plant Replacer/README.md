Assortment of high poly mesh and texture replacers for gourds using 3d-scanned real gourds. Finally a sorely-needed full overhaul of the gourd plant! Optionally put them all in your game with BOS. Includes unique changing models for Seasons of Skyrim. Patches provided for most food/cooking overhauls and survival mods. Everything is wrapped neatly into one user-friendly installer with everything you need.
  
  
**REQUIREMENTS**
  
 -[Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805)
  
-[Formlist Manipulator](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74037)
  
-[Seasons of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62861) if you want seasonal models
  
If you choose simple mesh/texture replacement in the installer with NO Seasons of Skyrim, you don't need any of these.
  
  
**TECHNICAL DETAILS**The mod is set up with compatibility in mind. There are four base gourd plant types. You can choose one, some, or all. Users who choose multiple variants have access to two versions, Stacking and Unique.
  
  
**Unique**: Gourd plants and each individual gourd in the world will be unique and they will keep their unique model once in your inventory. With the provided lightweight nonintrusive patches you can still use the new gourd types in new recipes and they will have the same stats as the base gourd.
  
**Stacking**: This version is the most compatible and needs virtually no patches. However, this is at the cost of inventory models not being unique and world models of single INDIVIDUAL gourds will not be unique either. Gourd PLANTS will still have unique models. This means your plants will be variant but when harvested will create one stack with a single model in your inventory.
  
  
Seasons of Skyrim users will see seasonal progression in their gourd plants. There are two summer gourd plants and two winter gourd plants. Depending on which variants you choose you could have gourds harvestable only in summer, only in winter, or both. Take a look at the images to get a better visual idea of the progression. If you do not use Seasons, your gourds will be harvestable year-round. All versions come with snow models to swap in snowy areas but you won't see them in-game because vanilla Skyrim does not place any gourds in snowy areas, and I could not find any popular mods that do so either. In the future if I can find any mods that do so, the update will be easy to push through because the inis are already setup for the process. Those experienced with modding will be able to add the records themselves if they find any (though do let me know)!
