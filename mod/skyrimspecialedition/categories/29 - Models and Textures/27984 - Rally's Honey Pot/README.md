What it does:**                                   
  
This mod retextures the honey pots throughout Skyrim. The textures are made in 2K. Redid the Honey as well and gave it a more realistic look.﻿
  
  
[left]I´ve added an optional texture made for the mod [Honey Pot Special Edition](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3036)﻿.
  
So use either the main files if you want to keep it vanilla and take the HPSE replacer if you are using that mod.﻿[/left] ﻿
