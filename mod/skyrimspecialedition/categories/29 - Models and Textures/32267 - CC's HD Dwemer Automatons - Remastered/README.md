*An esteemed revisit to a previously crafted modification, now meticulously refined and enhanced for a premium user experience.*
  
  
The commencement of 2019 witnessed the birth of an initial mod, whose completion, though appreciated, never quite satiated my desire for perfection. This **remastered version**, bearing textures that not only manifest my envisioned excellence but also promise to enchant every user with their impeccable detail and quality.
  
  
**Key Features Include:**
  

  
* **Unparalleled Surface Detail:** Achieved through the adept application of Neural Networks, utilizing a proprietary model.
**Sophisticated Specular Maps:** Comprising detailed grunge passes.
  
* **Enhanced Normalmap:** Offering an unprecedented level of detail.
**Incorporated Curvature and AO:** Strategically implemented to augment detail.
  

  
  
**Texturing Process Overview:**
  
The textures underwent a sophisticated upscaling process via ESRGAN software, employing a model trained distinctively for enhancing textures and normalmaps. Curvature and Ambient Occlusion (AO) were procedurally generated from the normalmap within Substance Designer, while final texture assembly was executed in Photoshop CC 2020.
  
  
**Compatibility and Availability:**
  
This modification maintains compatibility with all mods, barring those that alter the textures of the dwarven automatons. The textures are available in both 4K and 2K resolutions, ensuring both visual fidelity and performance flexibility for users.
  
  
Thank you for considering this mod, and may your experience with it be as splendid as the journey of its creation.
