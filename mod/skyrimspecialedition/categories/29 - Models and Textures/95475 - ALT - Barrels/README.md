# ALT - Barrels

Hi !
  
  
Second exercise ! I was looking to do something rounded and like last month I redid the Crates, the barrels should go well with it.
  
  
The goal of this exercise was to recreate the barrels from scratch, from 3D to texture. All while having as few polygons as possible and Only one BSTrishape to reduce Draw Calls. But I wanted to keep the rings and the cork in 3D
  
I worked on the "Normals" in Blender to make the boards stand out and the rings to look round.
  
For the texture I wanted something that "goes everywhere", not that the barrels look new, with wear. I worked these textures to the best of my knowledge. I hope you will like it.^^

* Main files - Texture 2K/4K an meshes replacer for the Barrel01/02, TGbarrel, Riekling barrel. NO ESP
Main Files 2K/4K "**DIVERSITY**" : Add possibility to use "ALT - Barrels" with other barrel mods and textures with [Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805)﻿. NO Cell Edit
  
* Optional Files - Texture 2K/4K an meshes replacer for the Black-Briar mead barrels and HonningBrew mead barrels. ESP (ESL Flagged) NO Cell Edit
The barrel01 contains 1452 Tri and Barrel02 1068 Tri with only one BSTriShape. Which is vastly inferior to most mods that change barrels.
  
* The meshes contain an "Environment map" to make the metal look like metal.
Animated meshes in the optional files.
  
* For other language textures, see here => <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/images/197433>﻿

  
  

Enjoy !

**If you wanted more or less shine for the metal part :** 
  
  
In NifSkope on the "BSLightingShaderProperty", change the value of the "Environment Map Scale" parameter
  
  
Less Shine **<---** **0.5** **--->** More Shine
