I redesigned it completely with, of course, textures up to 4k, particle light, and a visual overhaul.
  
As another version, I fixed the vanilla sigil stone meshes and upscaled the vanilla textures.

FAQ
  
  
General
  
  
1) If I make a video of the mod, will I be on the front page?
  
The first good-looking video will be on the front page!
  
  
2) Can I share my screenshot here?
  
SFW only, and to do so, post them on media with my mod selected!
  
  
3) What program do you use?
  
Photoshop, Substance Painter, C4D, 3D Coat, Blender, Nifskop, and Real Esrgan
  
  
4) Give permission for users to modify my file, including releasing bug fixes or improving on the features my file adds to the game, and upload it as a separate file?
  
Yes, you can enable donation points as long as it's a separate file that doesn't contain the original work.
  
  
5) Where are the 4k textures?
  
 Check out my [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/P7Wv5WBw5b) for more info. 
  
  
Skyrim SE
  
  
1) What ENB do you use?
  
[AMON ENB REBORN](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99786)﻿2) I can't download it. Help!
  
If you can't download it, just wait at least one hour for the Nexus server to fix it before telling me that you can't download it!
  
  
3) What if I use an older version of Skyrim SE? Will the ESL work?
  
Yes, with this mod [Backported Extended ESL Support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441)4) It still doesn't work for me even with backported extended ESL support. What do I do?
  
Download the LE version and fix it with xedit. Turn the 43 into a 44. You play with an old version, so you need to do the older fix.
  
  
5) Why is it so small in the inventory?
  
Because you need [ELIF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66411) for ENB particles. ﻿
