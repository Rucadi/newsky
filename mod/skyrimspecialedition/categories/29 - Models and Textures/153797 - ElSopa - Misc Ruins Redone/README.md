[font=Arial]**Some of the ugliest objects in the catacombs redone from scratch
  
I was tired of these terrible looking things, good textures weren't enough, so I had to remake them clean.
  
Maybe I could add some more over time, maybe.
  
Every object is made with performance in mind, so don't worry about it reducing your performance or anything.
  
Probably I forgot a couple objects, some I decided to not remake on purpose.****COMPLETELY SAFE TO INSTALL OR UNINSTALL MID GAME.
  
Protip: unless your PC is pretty weak, the 4k option is fine, its all in closed spaces, it shouldn't be a problem.****A year in the making! ->*****(actually I was too lazy and abandoned it a dozen times, then added more models)******<-*****Have fun!**[/font]
