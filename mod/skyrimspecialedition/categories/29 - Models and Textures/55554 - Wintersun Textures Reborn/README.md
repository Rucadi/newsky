# Wintersun Textures Reborn

To make the textures actually better I have tested every single texture with different upscale models until I found the perfect model for each texture. Then I used paint net to edit the textures to make it better than just a simple yet tedious upscale.
  
  
I have also fixed any Alpha upscale since somehow when I upscale alpha textures it becomes pixilated so I fixed it in Paint net.....which took longer than I wanted to be.
  
  
Doing this to revert mod I have ever upscaled.....which is gonna be a while so be patient because I have to test every texture with models I picked out one at a time which I have to test with Nifskope to see if it looks nice.
  
  
I made sure that every texture looks the best as I am able to. Spent about 3 or 4 weeks on this so hope you like them. The Hermaus Books are vanilla upscale since I do not want it to screw up any other mod using the resource so I just did a normal upscale with nothing special.
  
  
  
  
To use this mod of course you need [Wintersun - Faiths of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506)﻿
  
This version comes with a BSA so if you want to save space download the BSA and go into the files of Wintersun and delete the texture BSA then replace it with the BSA from this mod.
  
  
No preview pictures of cleaned spells since a lot of the nif meshes I found that involved spells used textures from Skyrim so kinda difficult to go through hundreds of Nif's to find few spell meshes that use the textures. If anyone wants to share screenshots of spells ingame using these textures then share them on this page, please.
  
  
This contains 2k, 4k, and cleaned textures.
  
  
  
*As of now all Gradients and Effects will always be the cleaned textures and never upscaled due to bad resolution when upscaled.*Also Enai let me know to make sure to put any credits that his mods have here so putting it here since I kinda forgot by mistake.
  
  
After I redo all texture mods I made before Dragon Priests [Which I might update]  I will also make an updated texture pack for Oblivion Artifacts since I may have made couple of mistakes as a beginner of upscaling.
