Dead Shrubs and Thickets are some of the most commonly encountered flora in Skyrim. This mod aims to provide a little variety to dead shrubs and thickets by allowing you to combine several of my mods plus another dead shrub and/or thicket replacement of your choice from other mods. Any thicket or dead shrub replacement that uses the vanilla editorID for dead shrubs and thickets will work (this would be most mesh/texture replacements).
  
  
**Installation**
  

  
* Download the FOMOD and choose your options. Pictures are included in the FOMOD along with written descriptions to help you choose the option that's right for you.
1k, 2k, and 4k texture options are included in the FOMOD as of version 3
  
* Seasons of Skyrim support file is also provided in the optional files. Overwrite/Merge with the main mod after installing main mod.

  
**Performance**
  

  
* Thorny Thickets in Version 3 of this mod have much more complex than the vanilla thickets. They should not cause an issue unless your system is already struggling or an area has a large number of thickets placed.
Mostly Dead Shrubs have a new mesh, but should perform similarly to the vanilla dead shrub.
  
* The completely dead thickets and shrubs are a new mesh in Version 3, but are still very performance friendly.

  
**Version Notes****Whats new in Version 3.0?**All meshes and textures were recreated, using the same plants for inspiration. So the thickets and shrubs should have the same feel as previous versions, with the goal of making them look better than the previous versions.
  
  
**What's new in version 2.0?**
  

  
* There are now nine different swap options with multiple combinations available.
Seasons of Skyrim Support
  
* Completely Dead versions of Shrubs and thickets have been rolled into the main mod, so now you can have up to four different replacements for dead shrubs (if you use another mod for the fourth replacement) and up to three replacements for thickets (if you use another mod for the third replacement).

  
**How do I know if a mod uses the vanilla EditorID?**
  

  
* If the mod does not have a esm/esl/esp associated with it, it does not replace the EditorID
If the mod does have an esm/esl/esp, it may modify the EditorID. This would have to be checked in either SSE Edit or Creation Kit, to confirm that the mod will work with this mod.
  

**List of Compatible Dead Shrub and Thicket Replacements**
  
If you know of a mod that works with this that isn't listed, let me know and I'll add it. If you have a mod that changes the EditorID of Dead Shrubs or Thickets and would like it to work with this mod, tell me the name of the mod and I'll see about adding the EditorID to the SWAP ini file.
