**Frankly HD Dragonbone and Dragonscale - Armor and Weapons***"[i][i]Is your armor made of... dragon bones? By the gods, what I would do for a set of that.*[/i]"[/i]
  
  
**High resolution (up to 8k)** retexture of Dragonbone and Dragonscale sets. 
  
Includes **Dragonbone and Dragonscale armor sets**; all **Dragonbone weapons** added by Dawnguard DLC and the **Jagged Crown**.
  
  
Vanilla normal maps were upscaled with a neural network software leading to much **crisper and clearer details** than one normally gets with upscaling on traditional image editing software. Then the textures were crafted on that framework.﻿
  
  
Textures have been **compressed using BC7** for maximum quality.
  
  
**Compatible with all mesh replacers**.
