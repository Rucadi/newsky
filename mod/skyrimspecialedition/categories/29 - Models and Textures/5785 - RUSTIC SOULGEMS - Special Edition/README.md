# RUSTIC SOULGEMS - Special Edition
- Author: Gamwich and Saerileth
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5785
[font=Tahoma]**RUSTIC SOULGEMS** features hi-res textures and modified meshes. Empty soulgems now have transparency and a subtle animated color-shifting effect. Filled soulgems will now have a pulsing glow animation as well. They look almost like beating hearts trapped in the soulgems. As in real life where smaller animals have faster heartbeats than larger animals, so is the glowing animation with the soulgems. They pulse at different rates, with the grand soulgems having the slowest pulse. It took a lot of time and effort to work out these animations, so I hope people enjoy the immersive additions of **RUSTIC SOULGEMS**.[/font]

Each soulgem has it's own diffuse texture, rather than sharing textures as in the default version. Normal maps are still shared to keep the file size down. The soulgem holder has been retextured as well. 2K and 1K versions are available. This mod contains meshes, textures, and an esp to make it all work in game.
  
  
There are two versions of the mod, sorted and unsorted. Unsorted is the way the vanilla game organizes things, where everything is listed alphabetically in the inventory. While the sorted version groups like items together. Therefore, all soulgems would be shown grouped together, and sorted by size.

The new FOMOD installer has a patch for [GIST - Genuinely Intelligent Soul Trap SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15755) by [opusGlass](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/6123863).

[font=Tahoma]I always felt that soulgems were a unique and special item in the game, but they looked anything but. The soulgems were dull, opaque, and too similar in appearance. I wanted to make the soulgems worthy of the name. Gems are transparent (at least to some degree), and anything that can contain a soul must have unusual properties, and that should be evident by it's appearance.[/font][font=Tahoma]
  
  
With the kind assistance of Saerileth, I was able to realize the vision I had of a crystalline appearance that was befitting of the name soulgem. The refracting method that Madcat221 originally discovered was brought to the soulgem meshes. Saerileth also discovered a hidden "gem" in the original mesh that unlocked a color-shifting animation. Now, the soulgems gradually transition through 3 color stages. The soulgems finally look unique and special, not like dull opaque rocks.[/font]

[font=Tahoma]This pulsing glow effect is something that is very hard to show in a screenshot, so thankfully [Supertin](http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/1054929-supertin/) was kind enough to make a video to illustrate the effect. I'll let the video speak for itself:[/font]

[font=Tahoma]I could go on and bore everyone to tears, but I think I'll keep it short and let the pictures do the talking. One note on the color-shifting animation... it's subtle in vanilla lighting, but depending on your ENB, you might get a stronger effect. I should also note that transparency displays differently in inventory view than in game. The inventory view will look a fair amount more transparent. That just the nature of how Skyrim's lighting works.
  
  
I hope people enjoy the latest addition to my Rustic series of retextures for Skyrim (with a greatly appreciated assist from Saerileth). Special thanks to [Nazenn](http://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/11835658-nazenn/) for making the esp files for the empty/filled 2.0 version.
  
  
Cheers,
