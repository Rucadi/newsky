This mod retextures the Silver sword and greatsword, silver armor, Silver crossbow, silver staff and silver bolts. Optional consistency patches for Oblivion Artifacts Pack SE and Leanwolf's Better shaped weapons.
  
Textures only - no meshes or plugins. It is safe to add or remove from your game at any time.
  
  
The textures for the Silver Swords are based on [Cabal120's aMidianBorn Book of Silence](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35382)﻿. I used their normal maps as a base to create my retexture. 
  
  
Works with every mod that also works with vanilla silver textures, such as Heavy Armory, Animated weapons, etc. If you see any major stretching or dark spots when using a mesh replacer, please let me know by linking the mod in the comments and posting a picture of the bugged area (please spoiler the picture to not take too much space) and I will see if I can fix it.
  
  
Fomod lets you pick and choose what you want. 
  
  
Textures are 2k except Chest armor textures, which are 4k.
  
  
Half-res version available in Optional files (1k textures, except chest armor textures, which are 2k)
