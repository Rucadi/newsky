This is simply a texture tweak replacement for the Eidar cheese from [Realistic HD Food Remastered](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22087).
  
It changes the cheese02.dds texture in Data/textures/clutter/HHPLRealisticHDFood to a lighter version.
  
  
**Installation**
  
download [Realistic HD Food Remastered](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22087)
  
download myLighter Cheese mod and allow to overwrite
  
safe to install midgame because it is just a texture
  
  
**Uninstallation**
  
safe to uninstall midgame, just make sure you still have the original texture
  
(if you don't, just reinstall Realistc HD Food Remastered)
