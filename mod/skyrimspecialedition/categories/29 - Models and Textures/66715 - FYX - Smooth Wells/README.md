# FYX - Smooth Wells

While waiting for my next FYX - 3D ?:)?, I share this file with you.
  
I found the angle of the wells too pronounced so I smoothed them.
  
  
- Simply smooth water wells and magic wells.
  
- Fix some UV's. 
  
  
For the Imperial Well, it is in optional file because many people use "Animated Clutter" and prefer boards that move.
  
Does not include the Riften well, it is already quite smooth.
  
  
Enjoy !
