**FAQ:**
  
  
1) Why is there an .esp? I thought this was just a replacer?
  
• Some weapons do not have a unique model in vanilla skyrim, for example, Alessandra's Dagger uses a Steel Dagger. A path update is required to display a unique model.
  
  
2) Another mod out there changes the stats of one of the weapons in the esp!
  
• These changes will need to be carried forward either in a separate patch or the model path will need to be changed in that particular mod to match this mod. Let me or that mod author know about it.
  
  
3) Why only Daggers?
  
• This is the first pack of many to come. Other packs will be released as time goes on, such as one-handed swords, staves, etc. Yes, there will be a compilation at the end.
