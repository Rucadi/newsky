[With permission from HXP](https://i.imgur.com/rjXwbtv.jpg), I merely brought his retexture of the Ice Wraith to Special Edition for more convenience as there was no retexture for this creature on the nexus.
  
  
**Features:**
  
  
The Ice Wraiths were completey retextured and added with a little bit more glowing so they will also stand out more and have a little bit more 3D effect. Colours and contrast have been improved.
  
As an optional file you will find a red glowing version of the Ice Wraiths, see the screenshots for more info.
  
  
This is totally lore friendly since there are no new or any weird texture added.
  
  
**Installation:**
  
  
Copy and paste into your Skyrim directory or use your favorite mod manager: download and install.
