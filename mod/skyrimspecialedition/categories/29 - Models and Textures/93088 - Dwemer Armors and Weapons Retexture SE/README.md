This mod retextures the Dwarven armors (including DLC items) , dwarven weapons (including DLC items), Keening, CC dwarven mail, CC Dwarven Plate, CC Fishing's Dwarven rod and Irkngthand war axe, CC Forgotten Seasons's masks, crown and staff, CC Arcane Archer pack's Soul stealer arrows, CC Sunder and Wraithguard and CC Fearful fists' Dwarven Brawler fists. Also Contains optional consistency patches for [Legacy of the dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802)﻿, [LOTD's CC patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31563)﻿, [The Tools of Kagrenac](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14168)﻿, [The Forgotten City](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1179)﻿, [Aetherial Crown](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4309)﻿, [Aetherial Armors and Weapons Compilation](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2687)﻿, [Elsopa's Quivers Redone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65921)﻿, [Oblivion Artifacts Pack SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10644)﻿, [Easter Dwemer Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44443)﻿, [Nordwar UA's Dwarven armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31679)﻿ and [Xtudo's Visage of Mzund](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69047)﻿.
  
  
When applicable I used [Amidianborn Book of Silence SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35382)﻿'s normal maps as a starting point to create my texture.
  
  
  
  
  
**COMPATIBILITY**
  
  
Works with every mod that also works with vanilla textures, such as Armor Variants Expansion, Heavy armory and Animated Armory.
  
  
Since these sets are very reflective, they work well with whatever Dwarven retexture you are using **without needing a patch**. Golden Dwemer Pipeworks Redone SE will still need patches to apply the correct cubemaps to your dwemer items. Simply load my retexture after said patches. More comparison images in the image section.

**FOMOD OPTIONS**
  
  
Fomod lets you pick and choose what you want.

Half-res version available in Optional files (Chest, weapons and shield are 2k, everything else is 1k)

KEENING**

**Will NOT OVERWRITE JS' Daggers version of keening**. These use a custom texture path and model. I recommend still installing my retexture as some other mods like Heavy armory still use the vanilla keening texture paths

Optional retextures for mods I enjoy. They are meant to help add consistency in your game, but are completely optional.
