**Description**
  
  
Edited Meshes and textures, toned down Emissive Multiple and Transparency,
  
 making these effects less of an eyesore at night and more to my taste.
  
  
One "downside" of this mod could be the effect appearing near non-existent during sunny day time,
  
depending on your ENB + weather + lighting set up.
  
But frankly, these effects annoy me just as much during the day, so it's an "upside" for me. 
  
  
Note that if you do not have [Skyrim ENB Particle Patch for SSE](http://enbseries.enbdev.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=1499&sid=3c6c3a58f07c32329b553f8fbe150291)﻿ installed,
  
You might not need this, since the vanilla mesh plays quite well with ENB already.
  
  
However, I still prefer my toned down textures even with the vanilla mesh.
  
So if you don't want the emissive meshes, simply delete/hide the meshes folder from this mod.
