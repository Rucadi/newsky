Converted to SE and repackaged with permission from Eraston to modify.
  
Adds 132 face textures for RaceMenu ranging from Makeup, Moles/Beauty Marks, Scars and Warpaints.
  
  
The SE version comes ESL flagged and all overlays are now also selectable as colors/makeups. This is useful to NPC authors, because Face Overlays are not exported with the head where as makeups are. It can also save preset authors overlay slots.
