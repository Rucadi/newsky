**Dirt and Blood - (Mostly) Seamless Dirt Retexture**
  
  

At this point, it's safe to assume Dirt and Blood is a stable in most of our modlists. If that's true for you, you might be looking to refresh the dirt textures. I'm not a pro texture artist, but I'm happy with what I was able to come up with; it's an improvement to the original, at least (not to say that the original textures were bad, but I prefer more of a subtle layer of dirt to splatters). If you're looking for something a bit more natural, give this retexture a shot!

This retexture was created for CBBE (+ 3BA) and HIMBO bodies to minimize seams. It's not perfect, but it's good enough for me and I hope you enjoy it too!
