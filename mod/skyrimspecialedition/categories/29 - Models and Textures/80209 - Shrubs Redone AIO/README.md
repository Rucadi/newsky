Introduction

[/font][font=Verdana]This mod is a compilation of all my shrubs replacers and result of a work that started more than a year ago. I couldn't imagine I make it through all of this, but that's it! All textures are made from photos of real plants. My priority in any case always was to find best possible combination of quality, truthfulness, lore-friendliness if possible and affordability for everyone.
  
  
To make it clear, this AIO includes every texture from game that contains "shrub" in its name. It's possible to consider some ingame plants as shrubs, but techically they are not. I decided to also include my Vine Maple and Thicket replacers by two reasons. 1.In game resources they're placed into "plants/landscape" as other shrubs and not in "plants/ingridients" catalogues, so basically they're pretty close to shrubs. 2.For providing to users more comprehensive and clear solution.
  
  
So lets take a closer look on contents:

[font=Verdana]About resolutions[/font]

  
[font=Verdana]All textures can be divided in two groups: with aspect ratio of 1:1 (square) and with 2:1 (rectangle). Second group consists of Pine, Dead shrubs, Thicket and Vine Maple. This means that such textures in-fact half-sized compared to "square" ones. It explaines why I uploaded "2K Quality" and "8K" versions: most common shrubs in 2K, for example, closer to 1K quality, not to "full" 2K. I hope, now this will be less confusing.

Optional snowy versions

As you may know, there are mods that demand seasonal changes from plants textures for pleasurable gameplay. And not all shrubs have such textures by default. In optional snowy versions file you can find snowy textures for Fall Forest, Yellow, Tundra and Reach shrubs. The file contains all resolutions and uncompressed files as well. Manual installation in needed directory is intended. Please note, that I not guarantee its compatibility with any mod, because my main goal is always is only replace vanilla texture.

[font=Verdana]Q&A
  
[/font]

[font=Verdana]
  

  
* Q: Is this compatible with XXX mod?[size=3]
  
[/size][/font]    [font=Verdana]   A: This contains only textures for vanilla meshes. Obviously, mods that alters shrubs with new 3D meshes is most likely incompatible.[/font][font=Verdana]
  
  

  
* [size=3]Q: What will happen with single parts? You gonna hide them? I don't interested in this, I only use XXX.
  
[/size][/font]        [font=Verdana]A: No. Standalone parts will not be hidden. If something will change in the future, files here and in single shrub page will be synchronized.[/font][font=Verdana]
  
  

  
* [size=3]Q: Oldrim compatibility?
  
     A: No. BC7 is used. Check out uncompressed files and build your own LE-compatible version, it contains everything needed.
