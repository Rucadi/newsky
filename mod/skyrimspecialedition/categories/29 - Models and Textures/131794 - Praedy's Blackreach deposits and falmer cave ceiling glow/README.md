* Cave ceiling glow for both blackreach and the falmer caves.
Geodes / soul gem deposits retexture with distinct depleted textures separate from the ones used for other ore deposits.
  
* Glowing rocks retexture (with 1 or 2 uv edits, also they're very subtle, i did that on purpose, massive cyan glowing rocks looked very out of place so i went for subtle instead).
complex parallax material support.
