Hi everyone!
  
  
If you've downloaded my mod [slightly Better Small Antlers and Deer Hide](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/83672) (thank you!) you'll know I've been working on fixing the awful pelts that feature in vanilla Skyrim. At present this mod contains my Elk Pelt and the Deer/Reindeer Pelt. As I finish more of the pelts and hides, I'll add them here. I'm currently working on Horse Hides (pretty much done) and the Bear Pelt in all its flavors. 
  
  
If you've downloaded my Elk Pelt previously, you can safely overwrite that with this mod. As this is a mesh and texture replacer, you can install it to see if you dig it, and uninstall it without any ill effects on your save.
  
  
Thanks for checking out the mod!
  
  
Update 24th Mar '23. The pelts are now fluffy! A massive thank you to [SkySinclaire](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/60342526), author of the fantastic [Pelage - Fluffy Animals and Creatures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73400) mod for the update! Be sure to download Pelage, and to give SkySinclaire some kudos for this update. Thank you!
