**DESCRIPTION**
  
  
New mod that replaces butterfly and moth models and textures.
  
  
--------------
  
  
Butterfly and moth retextures using a modified version of [wiseman303](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/545863)'s fixed collision mesh.
  
  
Each butterfly mesh was given improved UVmaps for the specific texture, so the default texture path was changed.
  
Bug Jars are not included yet, therfore their model and texture was not changed.
  
  
Now added support for:
  
[Rudy HQ - More Lights for ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22819)Install the pach for the Lunamoth after rudy's mod.
  
Many thanks to him for setting up the mesh.
  
  
  
FAQ:
  
  
**Q: ENB?**
  
A: [Kr goddess ENB](https://gwynhyrs-saga.tumblr.com/post/156927865313/not-quite-a-goddess-by-request-heres-a)﻿ (i'm sorry it's LE only)
  
**Q: Butterflies land mid air? Help?**
  
A: That's a common issue with skyrim butterflies,and cannot be fixed through the meshes only.
  
It requirs edits in the creation kit to the landing spots.
  
  
[Butterflies Land True  - Skyrim SE -](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29434?tab=description) fixes the issue.
