PBR (physically based rendering) approximates how real materials react to light and is used in most modern games. PBR is a part of Community Shaders 1.0 that has several benefits which includes  more realistic lighting than in vanilla and complex material.
  
  
There are two ways (maybe more) to create PBR textures:
  
1. Using raw assets which have all the maps needed for perfect PBR textures.
  
2. Using non-PBR textures and create missing maps using AI models based on what is available.
  
  
I have used the 2nd approach as I do not have the raw assets. To achieve this I have unbaked shadows from diffuse maps, upscaled them using an AI model, created separate Ambient Occlusion maps, and roughness maps. Also meshes needed to be configured to enable physically based rendering.
  
  
Version 2 of this mod includes a lot of textures lovingly created and tweaked by the magnificent [Faultier](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Faultierfan). Thanks a lot for this contribution! Please consider this version in alpha state for now, because so much has been updated and the fomod offers many options that I have not been able to test each and every possible one. But I will react to comment posts to solve issues, if there are any.
  
  
**Includes textures** for the following plants:
  

  
* Cathedral - 3D Deathbell (incl. a glowing option)
Cathedral - 3D Dragons Tongue (in various colors including glowing options)
  
* Cathedral - 3D Mountain Flowers
Cathedral - 3D Nightshade
  
* Cathedral - 3D Pine Shrubs
Cathedral - 3D Snow Berries

Cathedral - Mushrooms
  
* Cathedral - 3D Thicket and Dead Shrub
Cathedral 3D Lavender - Alternate Textures from ICFur
  
* Optional textures available for Kabu's Cathedral 3D Nightshade Redone

It can be selected in the FOMOD during the installation which of the plants you want to install.
  
Textures are generally provided with 2k resolution.
  
  
For other plants not covered by this mod, I highly recommend to check my [PBR Flora Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/148782) and [Diverse high-quality PBR shrubs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/154489). The 3 mods together shall cover most of Skyrim's Flora without overlap and conflicts.
  
  
**Installation:**
  
1. Install like any other mod
  
2. Check requirements:
  
 ﻿- Make sure that you have version 1.0 or higher of Community Shaders installed
  
 ﻿- Make sure you have the original Cathedral Plants installed
  
3. Run ParallaxGen: This mod does not incldue meshes, so you need to have the original mod installed and run ParallaxGen
  

  

  
**Seasons support:**
  
The latest version comes with support for [Seasons of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62861). You need to have [Seasons of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62861)﻿ installed. No other additional requirements.

  
* Does it work together with [Seasonal Landscapes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66903)﻿? If using latest version 2.3 of 'Cathedral PBR plants' or higher it does. Let 'Cathedral PBR plants' overwrite 'Seasonal Landscapes' (left side in MO2).
How do seasonal plants vary? For a first iteration I have mostly recolored textures. But started to experiment with more far-fetching differences. Lavendar blossoms will be very small in spring and large in summer. Mushrooms will be 30-50% smaller in spring compared to summer. I plan to bring in more differentation in later iterations.
  
* Which seasonal variants are there? I have used the same approach as Seasonal Landscapes which is generally 3 variations. This means there are two seasons using the same textures. I may add more variations but first I would like to add Seasons support to my other mods.
Why do the winter variants come without snow? I have seen beta versions of Community Shaders that can render dynamic snow. I hope this to materialise into reality at some point and then it will better to have textures without snow baked-in.
  
* I do not like a certain seasonal plant looks like! Please let me know in a nice way. There is a sticky post where you can add your feedback. I cannot promise to please everybody, but a very open to consider ideas for improvements. Also real biologist's feedback is warmly welcome.
