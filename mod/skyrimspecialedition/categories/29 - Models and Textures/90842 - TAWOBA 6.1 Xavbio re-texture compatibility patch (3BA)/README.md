**Simple patch to make some Xavbios re-textures,
  
compatible with SunJeongs TAWOBA 6.1.
  
  
Update: Part of [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/111200)﻿ now, which I recommend over this.**
  
  
  
Basically just UV-Map edits (with permission),
  
 of **[SunJeongs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/76830973?tab=user+files)﻿** models,
  
to fit [**Xavbios**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/10028290?tab=user+files)﻿ textures better.Spoiler
  
Most of the TAWOBA armor pieces work fine with Xavbios textures,
  
but there is some parts that won't work well with them.
  
(preview images have couple examples)
  
  
52 edited armor pieces included here, with edited uv-maps to fit the textures of Xavbio,
  
and when seemed possible, some uv-parts upscaled to improve visuals a bit.
  
  
**Will work with any textures**, but **made with Xavbios
  
textures in mind.
  
  
Currently included:**-Iron
  
-Steel
  
-Orcish
  
-Elven
  
  
**Re-build in bodyslide**, to see effects in-game.
  
(No CBBE, **only 3BA**)
  
  
**I do not recommend manually overwriting SunJeongs files**.
  
**Make backups, or use mod organizer of your choise.**
