[center]**[size=5]INTRODUCTION**

  

This is a visual overhaul of the bears of Skyrim. Each type of bear (brown, snow and cave bear) will now have distinct features. Bears are bigger and feature realistic fur using shell texturing, a technique used in modern games like RDR2. The hunting trophies have also been updated to match the new models. The brown bear loading screen uses an improved model as well for consistency.

**[size=5]BROWN BEARS**

**Brown bears** are the most imposing ones. They are extremely tall and muscular
  
under the thickness of their fur. Broader heads, thick arms and shorter snouts are their
  
distinctive features. They are one of the many reasons Skyrim's wilderness is considered
  
extremely dangerous.

  
  
  
  

**CAVE BEARS**

**Cave bears** are used to live in dark areas and their bodies reflect that. They are
  
significantly smaller than brown and snow bears, even though they are still considered large
  
compared to their cyrodiilic counterparts. They have large eyes and ears to efficiently track
  
down their preys and be aware of their surrounding in the deep and dark caves they roam. Their paws
  
and backs also have an increased bone densitiy, a consequence of the hazards they face in the
  
caverns. As a result, they present bigger paws and hunched backs.

  
  
  
  

**SNOW BEARS**

**Snow bears** live in the northernmost parts of Skyrim. They have smaller, longer
  
heads than their counterparts and are a bit smaller than brown bears. Notorious fans
  
of fish, they won't refuse a bite of a lost pilgrim or foolish adventurer. Be careful when
  
wandering the shores of the sea of ghosts.

[size=5]﻿**COMPATIBILITY**
  
  
It should be compatible with literally anything that doesn't touch the Bear Race records since it doesn't directly replace the vanilla models but changes them through a plugin. So if another mod uses a retextured bear, it will use the vanilla mesh and you won't experience any issue. [/size]
