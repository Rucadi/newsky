**(I know its A LOT of screenshots, but check them all please!)**
  
Cloaks Of Skyrim is one of my favorite mods off all time, I always thought that the scope of it was amazing, but maybe it lacked a little on the visual department, after using others retexture attempts, I felt like there was something more that I could do, to be honest after taking a look of the amount of work required I forgot about it, but little by little I did it. Abandoned it regularly over the span of one year, but its done now.
  
Tweaked meshes for better UV mapping.
  
New unique normals for each cloak/cape.
  
Redone textures with all I learned.
  
**All created from scratch, no souless upscaling!**
  
*Textures not included:
  
-Greaybeards Cloak
  
-Dragon Priests
  
-Talos Cape*
  
Maybe in the future I could add those but not in my plans for now.
