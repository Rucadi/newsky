Glorious Doors of Skyrim (GDOS)

[/font]**

**﻿Welcome to Glorious Doors of Skyrim!**
  
  
Many have asked, so finally here it is!
  
An all-in-one package of all the doors I created so far.
  
Shipped with a handy Fomod installer and a new door only available in this pack.
  
  
**Content:**
  
  
**26** unique new door meshes, replacing 50+ door meshes ingame used in hundreds of instances!

I thought about how to set up this pack many times and decided to only include 2k and 4k textures in it.
  
The 8k versions are used by only around 5% of people and it would bloat the download file to almost triple the size.
  
As I don't want to clutter the download page of this mod you'll have to visit the original mod sites to download the 8k versions.
  
  
Included mods in this pack:

[font=Tahoma]**Thanks**[/font]
  
  
I guess this is the right time to thank the amazing Skyrim modding community!
  
I'm happy to be a part of it and I'm having a blast since I started with 3D just about a year ago.
  
  
Also **A HUGE THANK YOU** to all the amazing people I'm constantly hammering with questions on Discord.
  
Absolutely everyone was always totally friendly and glad to help me out, I've never experienced anything like that in other communities!
  
**I LOVE 3D.**
  
  
Thanks to mathy, SarthesArai, FrankFamily, Alex, Hayden, Bartalon, Kesta, and all the other people I forgot!

  

[font=Tahoma]**New door**[/font]
  
  
**Splendid Mechanized Dwemer Door**
  
  
A new door for the Dwemer dungeons and the Markarth city gate.
  
Including custom animated gears with matching sounds which I modeled after the Vanilla Dwemer cog to fit the style of the game. As there was no Vanilla sound which fit the gear animation exactly the door comes with an ESL plugin, which adds a custom sound file.

Is this the end?

[/font]**

Yes, almost certainly unfortunately.
  
Never say never, I know. But right now I'm not planning to do any more doors.
  
I've got so much other stuff I'm interested in and just not enough time.
  
I'd like to dedicate the little time I have to new things and acquire new skills.
  
  
Thanks for all you support!
