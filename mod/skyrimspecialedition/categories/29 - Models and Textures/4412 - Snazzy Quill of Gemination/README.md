I don't think I've seen anywhere that any love has been given specifically to the Quill of Gemination quest item.  
  
Just doesn't seem right that a creation by the Wizards of Winterhold made for the head of the Black-Briar family should share the same look as any common quill?!?  
  
  
So, here's a little replacer mod with two different options, Light or Dark, for the Quill of Gemination.
