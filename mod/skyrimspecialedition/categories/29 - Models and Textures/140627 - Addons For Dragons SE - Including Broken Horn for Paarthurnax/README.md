Hello everyone! I finally have a non-werewolf mod for you all, though equally just as cool... DRAGONS!
  
  
There's a lot of dragon replacers out there now, and between GOT, Dragons SE, and Modernized I like them all in different ways, but I got inspired by 4th Unknown's work, and wanted to provide a few small addons to help my enjoyment of the replacer, and hopefully for others too!
  
  
Currently, there is only two small things.
  
  
**Paarthurnax's horn is now damaged:** I tweaked his mesh to break off the first chunk of his horn on one side, and also edited one of his chin spikes too, to reflect the damage he's shown to have in the vanilla game.
  
  
**Serpentine Dragon Replacer:** Mostly made so that these guys don't stick out in your modded game as badly. I made a new green eye texture for them and even gave them a forked tongue. Texture used is a warmer-toned version of Vuljotnaak's texture from [Chaos Dragons 4thUnknown Dragons SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/136502) and an edited version of the young dragon mesh from the same mod.
  
  
I want to do more, so please, suggest away on what you'd like to see! Though keep in mind that I do have time and skill limitations, so try to be patient haha.
  
  
All images are taken in a crusty, vanilla Skyrim without any reshader or anything.
  
  
**Current Future Plans:**A patch for Bellyache New Dragon Species (next project)
  
  
**Q and A:**Q: Can you do Diverse Dragons Collection?
  
A: I want to, but it's a big project and I am not sure if I can.
  
  
Q: What mods are required?
  
A: Just Dragons SE itself.
  
  
More to come I'm sure.
