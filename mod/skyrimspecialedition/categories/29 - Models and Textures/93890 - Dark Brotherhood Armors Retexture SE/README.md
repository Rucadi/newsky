This mod retextures the Shrouded Armor and Shrouded Robes, letting you choose between a classic red and black version and a full black version for each. Included in this mod are also optional matching retextures for H4lf D3ead's [Better Shrouded Armor SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3608) (also contains the extra textures used in MANHUNTER69's great [Better Shrouded Armor Mesh Fixes and Additions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/87122)) , Veer, Kwrrrttty, and Sebastian's [The last shadowscale](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43720) (also works with Cupcakeninja64's Shadowscale set reborn) and Watcherzero's [Oblivion Artifacts Pack SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10644)'s Hands of midnight. 
  
  
Also covers the extra scarf texture added by the unofficial patch
  
  
This mod contains textures only. Meaning it is compatible with every mod that works with vanilla shrouded armor or shrouded robes textures, such as [Reshaped Dark Brotherhood Robes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57583) and [Dark Brotherhood Armor Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56903).

Optional retextures for mods I enjoy. They are meant to help add consistency in your game, but are completely optional.
