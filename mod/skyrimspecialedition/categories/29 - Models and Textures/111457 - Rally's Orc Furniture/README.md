New textures for Orc Furniture with cleaned and tweaked UV maps for all included meshes, to get better use of texture placement.
  
  
For this set of Furniture, i decided to use a rather rough look with barely processed wood, that still has bark on it. 
  
  
The surface of the round table is made from a wood disk of a large old tree.
  
  
  
In vanilla, Orc beds don't have pillows, so i added the high poly pillows which i created for my Common Furiture Mod.
  
  
They want to have comfy beds too ;)
  
  
  
Available in 2K and 4K
  
  
Plus a desaturated version for those who prefer. It was meant to be used for ENBs with more saturation and darker interiors.
  
  
Pi-Cho ENB was used for the screenshots and the video.
  
  
It includes
  
  
- Beds
  
- Chairs
  
- Dressers
  
- Endtables
  
- Shelves
  
- Tables
  
  
Here´s a showcase

Since this replacer has UV tweaked meshes and new textures, it is **not** compatible
  
with other mods touching these objects. It has to be loaded after conflicting mods.﻿
