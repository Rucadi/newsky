# FYX - Windhelm Graveyard

Hi all!I finally finished an FYX that I had started in January. I had forgotten about it, and it took me a long time because the objective was, in addition to fix a few things, to "improve" this area **without** ESP. Which implies that we can't do anything, we have to pay attention to the movements of the NPCs, to the Occlusion Planes, Light, Marker, Navmesh...
  
The Windhelm Cemetery area is perhaps the ugliest, emptyest area, and some meshes are worthy of a LOD. This FYX tries to make it look a bit nicer.
  
  
  
  

  
* [YAR](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89416) required and mandatory﻿
Add some stuff and improves some Vanilla meshes to try to improve the area **WITHOUT ESP**.
  
* Fix the floating tombstones and the door frame.
Rework the stairs in this area.
  
* Fix some UV's and UV's Scale
Parallax version.
  
* JK's Optional meshes Patch.
Spaghetti's Cities Optional meshes Patch.
  
* Safe to install/uninstall anytimes.

  
  
Enjoy !
