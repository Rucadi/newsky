**VIGIL ENFORCER**

My goal for this set was to make it look more worn than the veteran's version. The idea being that regular vigils would get lower grade / less high quality armor than veterans.
  
  
**VIGIL VETERAN

![](https://i.imgur.com/BPRIzk4.png)**My goal with this set was to make it seem like a slight improvement over the enforcer version. It's cleaner, less damaged and shinier
  
  
**VIGIL SILVER HAND**

I wanted this set to be similar to the enforcer, when it comes to metal quality, damage and dirt. I changed the fur to black since that is the color of werewolves in vanilla. I want this set to look like it was crafted by werewolf hunters, using their fur.
  
  
**VIGIL CORRUPTED**

I wanted this set to look damaged, dirty and push the corrupted/infected look. I also made the fur white as I thought it would give an uneasy feeling. Like the color was sucked out of what was once brown fur
