I don't know why but I thought it had already been done. Nothing found on this subject.
  
  
According to [Korodic's](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/360983) suggestion :')
  
> *pretty sure I just need the Raven Rock docks and all my long, hard wooden poles are rounded :o*

  
  
Use SMIM meshes base
  
  
- Smooth the posts of the docks and fences
  
- Fix Uv's
  
- Replace UV's
  
  
Enjoy !
  
  
  
For those who want parallax, it seems that only [Rally's Solstheim AIO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36893) with the [Rally's Solstheim - Parallax](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51905) patch is that option (December 14, 2022)
