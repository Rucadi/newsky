# FYX - Black-Briar and Riftweald Manors

Here is an FYX I started a few months ago. At first I just wanted to redo the Mercer manor, I had seen some bugs and its architecture is probably the ugliest in Riften. The goal was to break the lines, to make it less cubic.
  
Once finished, I left it aside but then when I was walking around Riften it was the Black-Briar Manor that seemed too cubic, so I reworked it too.
  
  
It was not so easy because these two Manors are not perpendicular to the Gizmo of the 3D software, it took me some time. I'm still an amateur in 3D...
  
Since I made a lot of changes and fixed many Vanilla problems, I probably created some myself, if so I will fix them in the next updates.
  
Try it, anyway it's safe to install and uninstall during the game.
  
If you see any bugs, please report them to me in the 'Bugs' tab.
  
  
I hope you will enjoy this rework of the Manors.^^
  
  
  
**The Riftweald Manor :**- Raise the base of the roof while keeping the top of the roof at the same height to remain compatible with other mods and chimneys that are added with the CK. 
  
- Fix some UV's
  
- Add details
  
- Fix the placement of the balcony beams
  
- Hide the seams at the entrance of the stone tunnel, On each side. ( I saw only recently that RaiserFX also did this in a different way in [MCMO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49259) )
  
- Rework collisions
  
  
  
**The Black-Briar Manor :**- Pretty much the same thing and probably a lot of stuff I forgot...
  
  
  
Compatible with [Dawn of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9074) and [JK's Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6289)
  
No flickering mesh, compatible with Light Mods.
  
Safe to install/uninstall anyway !
  
Overwrite [3D Riften Trellis and Roofs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56973), [MCMO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49259), [Flickering meshes fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53957) and other conlict meshes.
  
NOT compatible with my **RYFTEN - Make your Riften file** **F** and **G**
  
  
  
Enjoy !

**Future updates:**
  
~~- Fix a few oversights.~~
  
~~- Should correct a problem and a big oversight of Bethesda that has obviously not been corrected since 2011. In any case I have not found anything about it.~~ ( It will be necessary that the authors of the textures mods follow for it to be usable )
