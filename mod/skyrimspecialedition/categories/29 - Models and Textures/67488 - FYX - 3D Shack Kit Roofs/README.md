After my FYX - [3D Shacks Kit Walls](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67123), i add planks to the roofs of the Shacks to make them look like they have a roof.
  
  
As for the walls, it was not so easy to do because they are pieces that fit together.
  
For example, Angi's cabin is an assembly of lots of small meshes, it is not a single mesh, which makes me less free to work.
  
  
Anyway I hope you enjoy
