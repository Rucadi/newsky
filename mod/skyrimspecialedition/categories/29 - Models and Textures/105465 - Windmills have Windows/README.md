# Windmills have Windows

Hi everyone!
  
  
I had a bug report on one of my mods this week around the area of the Battleborn Farm. When I headed down there, I had a bit of time to kill while bug testing and noticed that the windmills around Whiterun had windows but that they weren't transparent. I took the mesh into Nifskope and set the windows to be actual windows, at which point, I found that they were just stuck onto the side of the windmill without any holes to see through. I decided to put that right. The windmills around Whiterun now have actual windows. You can stand inside the windmill and watch the sunset, look at the stars, or watch the clouds cross the sky. I hope this small change adds a bit of immersion to your game.
  
  
The mod uses upscaled textures from vanilla for the windows. The rest of the mod will use your own textures. I'll try and get permission to release a Noble Skyrim version (my preference) and a Rustic Windows version. Stay posted on those.
  
  
Thanks for checking out the mod, and, as always, happy adventuring!
