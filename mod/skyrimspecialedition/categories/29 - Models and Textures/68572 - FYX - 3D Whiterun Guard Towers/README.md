- Author: Yuril

I used as a base the Shackit 3D model from SMIM which is substantially identical to the design of the Whiterun tower 2D boards.
  
And use  [Major Cities Mesh Overhaul SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49259)  fixes
  
  
- Replaces 2D boards with a 3D boards and nails.
  
- Repairs and replaces certain parts of the meshes.
  
- Fix some UV's forgotten by USSEP, SMIM and MCMO.
  
- Add more Vertex Color.
  
  
Enjoy !
