My new meshes with HD textures for the stone dinnerware set from great mod [Beyond Skyrim - Bruma SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10917)
  
This mod contains mesh replacers for the following NIFs: 
  
***ttcbowlstone.nif,******ttccup1stone.nif,******ttccup2stone.nif,******ttccup3stone.nif,******ttcpitcherstone.nif,******ttcplatestone.nif,******ttcurn1stone.nif,******ttcurn2stone.nif,******ttcurn3stone.nif.***
  
I would like to draw your attention to the fact that instead of "stone" dishes I decided to make metal dishes. In my personal opinion, stone dishes in Bruma look very strange. Why should the inhabitants of a developed region, possessing technologies for iron work, gold, silver, glass making, carpentry, blacksmithing, pottery, etc., use stone dishes, as if these inhabitants are troglodytes, cave dwellers of the prehistoric era??? That is why I decided to correct this misunderstanding.
  
This is called "author's choice" and accordingly my choice is not discussed. If you do not like it, then this mod is not for you. Just skip it, do not download and do not install. This will save you from having to write comments like "I don't like your choice" / "The name "stone \*\*\*" in the game doesn't match the appearance of the dishes" / "I want you to redo your textures the way I want" and so on. Please spare me from such comments and keep them to yourself.
  
  
The collision material in my new NIFs was also changed from "stone" to "metal" so that the sounds and any interactions with these objects in the game match their appearance.
  
[font=Georgia]**Compatability:**[/font]
  
Should be **fully compatible** with anything except mods from other author's that modify the above-mentioned NIFs.
  
  
**Not compatible**with mods that make any changes to the the above-mentioned NIFs, included in this mod, even if it is a simple name or folder structure change. Not compatible with any other meshes replacers and/or retextures for Bruma stone dishes.
  
  
No ESP, no scripts, meshes and textures only. So it absolutely safe to install/uninstall at mid-game (at any time).
  
  
I hope you will like it. Endorsement is very appreciate ?
