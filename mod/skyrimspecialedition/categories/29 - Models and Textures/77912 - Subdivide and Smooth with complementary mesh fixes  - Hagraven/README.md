Hagraven stuff in high poly, with UV fixes, material fixes and smaller adjustments.
  
  
**﻿Contents:**
  
- Some of the jankiest hagraven models (Poles, sticks and houses mainly) now in high poly
  
- Massive amount of material fixes (Wood is now wood, not stone and bone is bone, not wood etc)
  
- Removes some weird features from the meshes (house branches, animal veins)
  
- Small UV-adjustments, got rid of old and boring seams, introduced new and exciting seams!
  
- HagravenHouseSticks.nif now has a proper collision, akin to the other two stickrows that USSEP had fixed previously
  
- Where necessary, fixes and improvements from other modders were patched in, see credits and compatibility for more.
  
- Custom texture for hagraven wood models, your hagraven stuff wont be subject to your tree mod of choice anymore. Parallax option available.
  
- Fixed some shader issues (Honestly I dont know how, I noticed them only as I was taking the screenshots for this mod)
  
- Full support for wSkeever modding suite.
  
- Probably something I forgot to add.
  
  
**[size=4]Install:**
  
[/size]Download a version you'd like to use (normal or parallax), install with your favorite mod manager MO2. Parallax requires the good old parallax requirements, if you're not familiar with them, download the normal version. Install patches as necessary. Install the vanilla wood option if you dislike the texture I've implemented. Each download of the aforementioned is a tear running down my cheek :(
  
  
Uninstall whenever, doesn't matter, before, after, during save, loading in loading out, indoors outdoors, at the door, laying down or upside down doesn't matter. It's just meshes and a couple of textures, no esps, esls, esms, dlls, inis or other 3 letter words.
