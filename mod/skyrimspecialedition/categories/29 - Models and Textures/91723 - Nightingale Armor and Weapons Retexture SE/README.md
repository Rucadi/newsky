This mod retextures the Nightingale Armor, Blade and bow and an optional retexture for the Nightingale Blade's scabbard added by [Leanwolf's Better-shaped Weapons SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2017) I wanted to make this set look like it was given to you by Nocturnal. It has slight wear and tear from use, but still looks fairly new and otherworldly. Guards mention that it "Looks like forged midnight", so I went with black and dark grey leather with metal trims. I wanted to emphasize that this is only worn by the best thieves, so it should look elegant but not flashy / stand out too much.
  
  
I also added an optional mesh replacer that removes the cape.
  
  
  
  
Works with every mod that also works with vanilla textures, such as lowered hoods. If you see any major stretching or dark spots when using a mesh replacer, please let me know by linking the mod in the comments and posting a picture of the bugged area (please spoiler the picture to not take too much space) and I will see if I can fix it.

Optional retextures for mods I enjoy. They are meant to help add consistency in your game, but are completely optional.
