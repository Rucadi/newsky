Welcome to a revamped, realistic, and complete Banner Retexture Project. The successor to "Designs of the Nords" now featuring all base game and DLC banners.

[/font]**[font=Trebuchet MS]This mod retextures every banner and hold shield in the game including ones from DLCs in a way to allow them to feel worn, desaturated, look better with ENBs and changes the designs to fit the theme of each hold and faction. Now each new holds sigils are proudly presented on both their banners and guard shields for consistency.[/font]**
