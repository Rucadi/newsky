*OK first thing first. All textures are effects so no upscale. The enchanting table is just there so I would at least have an interesting thumbnail. Also I only cleaned this for personal playthrough until I found out from Enai Siaion when I chatted with them that I can upload cleaned textures of their mods so I am just throwing this out here since I already have it cleaned.
  
  
Reason I cleaned this is that I clean every mod I have because like I said a while back my PC is old so probably won't run the mod list I want to do later next year unless I get new PC parts which is highly unlikely so I have been cleaning in hopes of gaining more FPS and less vram usage when the time comes.*
  
  
To use this mod of course you need  [Summermyst - Enchantments of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6285)﻿﻿
  
  
  
This version comes with a BSA so if you want to save space download the BSA and go into the files of Summermyst and delete the texture BSA then replace it with the BSA with cleaned textures.
  
  
No preview pictures of cleaned spells since a lot of the nif meshes I found that involved spells used textures from Skyrim so kinda difficult to go through hundreds of Nif's to find few spell meshes that use the textures. If anyone wants to share screenshots of spells ingame using these textures then share them on this page, please.
