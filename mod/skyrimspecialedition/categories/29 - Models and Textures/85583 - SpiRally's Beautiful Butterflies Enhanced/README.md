What started as an idea to update my butterfly mod, became a complete overhaul of Butterlfies and Moths in Skyrim.
  
A little further down the road, [StoneSpiralGaming](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/95141903) joined this project and together we´re pretty happy to finally
  
share with you, what we have been working on for so long.
  
  
This mod replaces the Vanilla Butterflies, Moths, Ingredients and Jars (optionally TMD jars), with new Textures, improved
  
and reshaped vanilla meshes. It also adds **14 new Butterfly species** to the game. These will randomly spawn
  
throughout Skyrim, at hundreds of new spawners and land markers.
  
  
**Behavior has been tweaked, by including the changes made by Butterflies Unchained**
  
  
It is designed to work with SE/AE/VR. The plugin is an ESL flagged ESP
  
  
All Butterflies and Moths, have their matching ingredient and either Vanilla Jars or TMD Jars.
  
Each Ingredient has unique Alchemical Effects.
  
  
You can choose between default size and a 50% smaller version
  
  
The FOMOD includes patches for Apothecary, Lepidoptera, CACO, Saints and Seducers and Convenient Horses 
  
  
Optionally, there´s a version with possible spawns in some selected interior locations

[/font][font=Tahoma]- Temple of Mara
  
- Temple of Divines
  
- Temple of Kynareth
  
- Sleeping Giant Inn
  
- Frostfruit Inn
  
- The Drunken Huntsman
  
- The Bannered Mare
  
- Dead Man´s Drink
  
- Vilemyr Inn
  
  
The species "Spirally Specialis" will only spawn in one location.
  
We have hidden a note somewhere near, but it´s on you to find out where that is ;)
  
  
  
These changes have been made to the meshes 
  
  
- Butterflies have legs now
  
- Reshaped wings (including ingredients)
  
- Corrected wings for the Monarch and critter fixes included
  
- Smaller and thinner bodies (except moths)
  
- Thinner Antennae for Butterflies/ bigger Antennae for Moths
  
- Completely UV tweaked all meshes
  
- Fixed glass on Vanilla Jars (not purple anymore)
  
- fixes/changes made by the Particle Patch have been incorporated
  
  
Most butterflies have their common names, the proper scientific name (some a bit shortened) and
  
the color variations we came up with, have invented names ofc :)
  
  
All included Butterflies and Moths

Since this replacer has new meshes and textures, it is **not** compatible
  
with other Butterfly replacers or modifiers. It has to be loaded after conflicting mods.﻿ 
  
  
- It has Unchained Butterflies built-in
  
- Compatible with Butterflies Land True (Non Formlist Changes Version)
  
- Compatible with USMP
  
- Included Patches for Apothecary, CACO, Lepidoptera
