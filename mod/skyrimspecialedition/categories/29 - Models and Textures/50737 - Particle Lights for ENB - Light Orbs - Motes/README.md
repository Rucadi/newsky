Clarification: Vanilla game has these light orbs (for those who haven’t play enough to find them) I didn’t add the orbs themselves; I just added ENB Particle Lights to them.[size=3]
  
  
I visited "Yngol Barrow" the other day and when I started walking inside, I was like: "WHAAAT?!!... NOT IMMERSIVE... MY EYES! HALP!" lol
  
So, I made this (**check the images** :3).
  
You can go there normally to check this mod or (for faster checking) use the console command:
  
  
coc yngolbarrowexterior
  
  
...then go in the dungeon (do not use coc yngolbarrow01 because the orbs won't work properly that way... at least for me they were all static).
  
  
If you already completed that quest/dungeon, I'm sorry but you didn't experienced it the immersive way... xD just kidding!! But... well... that's a shame.
  
If somebody knows about other places that have these light orbs please let me know!! (I mean... to inform people about their possibilities for checking the mod).[/size]
  
  
UPDATE: as someone mentioned, these things are also in Soul Cairn! :O
