**STALHRIM ARMORS AND WEAPONS RETEXTURE SE**
  

"*Enchanted ice as hard as iron and cold as death. Stalhrim can be forged into deadly weapons, but the art is known only to the smiths of the Skaal.*"

This mod retextures the Stalhrim Light armor, Stalhrim Heavy Armor, Stalhrim Shield, Stalhrim Weapons, Redguard Scimitar, CC Stalhrim Fur Armor and CC Stalhrim Crossbow.
  
  
When Installing this mod, you will be prompted to choose which Stalhrim Meshes you use. My retexture supports: Vanilla meshes / no refraction meshes (anything that works with vanilla textures), [Stalhrim Refrozen](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41348), [Resurgence Armory - Stalhrim Weapons and Armor Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85604) and [Cathedral Armory](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20199) / [Refractive Stalhrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39306).
  
  
If you are not sure which one to use, My personal recommendation is Stalhrim Refrozen. I find it makes stahlrim items look more like magical ice. Resurgence Armory is another very solid option, it will make items look more like thick ice. 
  
  
  
Also contains optional consistency retextures for [Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802)'s Souldrender and Bloodscythe and Deathbrand Display, [Leanwolf's Better-Shaped Weapons SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2017)'s Stalhrim Scabbard and Scimitar Replacer, [Elsopa's Quivers Redone SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65921)'s Stalhrim Quiver, [MANHUNTER69's Deathbrand replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93374), [DuskIron33 DeathBrand Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5015)
  
  
This mod contains textures only. Meaning it is compatible with every mod that works with vanilla Stalhrim textures.
