Bottle replacer for Frost river mead from [Cutting Room Floor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/276) and Ashfire mead from Dragonborn dlc.
  
  
It's an ESPFE﻿ that will not count forwards your plugin limit.
  
also support for CC-survival.
  
  
I like the model and texture from [Jokerine](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/2543917)'s [Ashfire and Frost River Mead Textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/69464).
  
I use Unique Booze Bottles HD port myself that there's not cover ashfire model.
  
[Jokerine](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/2543917) has open permission in her profile page, though I try pm her but her account closed.
  
So I decide to use her model with my plugin to give the bottles unique.
  
  
This isn't add new custome mead like original mod.
  
I just use only mesh and texture converted with lastest Cathedral Assets Optimizer.
  
  
4 main files to choose.
  
Reupload seperate mesh and texture each files for convinent. Now not need the main file.
  
  
Ashfire and Frose River Mead *﻿require* ﻿Cutting Room Floor
  
  
Ashfire and Frose River Mead - CACO ﻿*require* ﻿Cutting Room Floor and CACO
  
  
Ashfire only ﻿*require* ﻿none
  
  
Ashfire - CACO ﻿*require* ﻿CACO
  
  
I never play with CACO so I'm not sure if the effect of Frost River Mead is properly add.
  
If anyone need to do a patch, feel free to do.
  
  
**Optional files now have Skypatcher version**
  
  
need [SkyPatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106659) to replace the model without conflicts. no esp.
