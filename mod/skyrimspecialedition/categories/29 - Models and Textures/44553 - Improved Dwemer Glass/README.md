I've gone through this game a million times and i've never had anything like this mod personally, it contains various dwemer meshes which have new texture paths to 2 textures, astrolabeglass.dds and astrolabeglass\_n.dds, whatever dwemer textures you have installed will remain, only the blue 'glass' will have a new texture. See the screenshots. Vanilla meshes point to dwemetaltiles03 which doesn't look too great in game whatever retexture you may have unless i'm mistaken. This contains some meshes from SMIM by Brumbek so if you have SMIM installed it is fully compatible, just overwrite.
