**FAQ:**
  
  
1) Why does it float in the air when dropped?
  
• This is an issue present in vanilla Skyrim and is done to prevent the Chalice from being knocked off its pedestal in Castle Volkihar. I could make a script to switch motion types when dropped but honestly, it's not worth it.
  
  
2) Can you add an ENB Particle Light version?
  
• Vampire blood doesn't glow or give off light, stop being silly.
