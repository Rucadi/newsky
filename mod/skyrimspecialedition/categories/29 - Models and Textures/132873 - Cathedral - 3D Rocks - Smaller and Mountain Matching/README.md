Scaled down all the rockgrass meshes and changed the texture paths to use whatever mountainslab01 texture you already have installed. Pebbles have their textures repathed but were not scaled due to their already tiny size.
  
  
Each type of rockgrass in the mod was taken into Blender and scaled down. Then the texture pathes were updated to use:

Note: Screenshots taken using the [Dense version of Cathedral - 3D Rocks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/132608?tab=files&file_id=557126&nmm=1) from the mod page to show maximum coverage.  I use [Mountains of the Northlands](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/127919?tab=files﻿) which are fairly dark grey so you may notice the rocks a bit more with brighter mountain textures.
