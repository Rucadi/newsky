[font=Verdana]Description[/font]
  
  
This is a non-beast lore-friendly male texture replacement with optional hair, dirt and muscle smoothness in different combinations for both nude (from Better Males) and dressed (vanilla based) bodies. SOS version also available.
  
There are also different versions of faces: three age variants, three skin smoothness variants.
  
Additionally there are new complexion textures; old males, snow elves and afflicted ones covered as well.
  
Compatible vanilla based beast races textures are also provided.
  
As the mod modifies the base textures it updates appearance of both PC and NPCs unless the latter use their own special textures.
  
  
  

Video review by [Devix1996](http://www.nexusmods.com/games/users/19517214/?)

  
[font=Verdana]About[/font]
  
  
It all started as an attempt to fix head colour and to reduce seams for Better Males which I wanted to have to accompany nude female body replacement. Over time I realised that Better Males body textures were too bad because of heavy compression and several resavings done years ago.
  
Everything should have been done from scratch or using high quality assets.
  
I am professional Photoshop user, but hardly can paint something new, so I started digging original Skyrim mods for free to use resources. Luckily I found some (see Credits section) and started reworking it.
  
It actually turned out good enough to be released and I continued work by adding options and making several sets of faces.
  
Besides I saw lots of non-nude version requests in other mods, so I added it too.
  
Later SOS Light compatible version was added.
  
  
[font=Verdana]Features[/font]
  
  
**Bodies:** nude (from [Better Males Remesh for Skyrim SE](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3672/?)), in underwear (different vanilla body based versions), Schlongs Of Skyrim Light, Schlongs Of Skyrim Full.
  
**Skin**: naturally looking body skin with hand painted veins.
  
**Seams**: corrected for every kind of texture (neck, legs, hands for diffuse, normal and specular).
  
**Hair options**: hairless, light haired, hairy, bear.
  
**Muscle options**:
  
• ripped - similiar to what you get used to see in vanilla game, 
  
• smooth - veinless and sleek, 
  
• natural - mix of the first two so that back doesn't look like carved of stone and veins are not that visible.
  
• sleek - muscles are way less visible.
  
**Dirt options**: with and without.
  
**Faces**:
  
• young - reworked Younger Beardless Face Textures Merged With Geonox from Oldrim using Complete Male Overhaul assets,
  
• elder - custom set based on young one,
  
• hard life - even more worned out look,
  
• stubbled faces by Geonox - something between young and elder with stubble.
  
**Faces normal maps**:
  
• smooth - less wrinkles, not that rough; made to accompany young set, but you can use it with elder one too. 
  
• harsh - reworked, much closer to vanilla,
  
• weathered - more wrinkled and rougher than vanilla normal maps.
  
**Complexions**: new and improved, parasite tint removed.
  
**Additional texture rexplacement:** for snow elves, afflicted ones, vampires, old males. 
  
**Argonian and khajiits:** compatible nude and dressed body textures based on vanilla ones, slightly improved.
  
**Technical info**: diffuse maps - body 4K and head 2K, normal maps 2K. Textures saved in BC7 format which allows to have almost uncompressed quality (you can't find the difference without picture editor usage) with DXT5 file size. Specular maps saved in BC4 (single channel usage, grayscale mode). Hands diffuse maps come in half-4K due to need of details, saved in DXT1 to compensate it.

[font=Verdana]Known Issues[/font]
  
  
• When you loot Briarhearts using SOS Full version, their bodies are swapped for basic SOS body, not an empty Briarheart one. It's a SOS issue, do the following to fix it:
  
*"When you first encounter a Briarheart, put your crosshair on him, go into the SOS MCM menu, and mark the Briarheart Armor as "Revealing". That's it. Problem solved."*Thanks to [bdip](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/43355177) for sharing the solution.
  
• Nude body meshes are actually used when a character is totally undressed. When you put an armor with bare chest, body meshes are changed for vanilla ones, even if you installed nude body. It happens because each such armor must be processed to use nude meshes instead of vanilla ones. It's quite a bit of work for those who know how to do it.
  
• Old males will have leg seams (inner part of hips) in nude version. But normally you won't see them naked.
  
  
[font=Verdana]FAQ[/font]
  
*Q: I'd like to adjust textures for a follower, but can't open it.  What's wrong?*A: I used BC7 format - it has almost uncompressed quality with DXT5 size, but this format is not widely supported by graphics editing software.
  
So:
  
• If you have Photoshop - download and install [Intel Texture Works plugin](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-texture-works-plugin) or [NVIDIA Texture Tools Exporter](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-texture-tools-exporter).
  
• If you don't have Photoshop, you can use AMD Compressonator to convert BC7 to another format:
  
  ▸ download it [here](https://github.com/GPUOpen-Tools/Compressonator/releases) - select one with GUI;
  
  ▸ do [this](https://compressonator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gui_tool/user_guide/TextureCompression.html#converting-image-formats) - select uncompressed destination format like ARGB\_888 or whatever you like and work with it as usual. 
  
*Q: Head color is different from body one!*
  
A: Make sure you've installed everything. Backup and delete at least '***Data/textures/actors/character/male**'* folder and perform a fresh install. 
  
  
*Q: I've got neck/hands/legs seam!*
  
A: Same as above. But keep in mind that slight seams might be visible under certain light conditions. 
  
  
*Q: I want other nude body options*!
  
A: Not planned. The mod contains reasonable nudity, it's not a genitals fair.
  
  
*Q: Could you add ...?*
  
A: Give a try and ask. Though no promises.
  
  
*Q: What ENB are you using for screenshots?*
  
A: See Mods Recommendations section.
  
  
*Q: Will there be a more performance friendly version or conversely, 4K or even 8K everything?*
  
A: No. Mod is designed to deliver both good quality and performance during gameplay at the same time.
  
BC7 texture compression format allows to reduce VRAM usage without hurting quality so that there is no need in lighter version. Current relatively modern PC specs will handle this mod wihout any problems. 
  
As for bigger resolution, this mod uses 4K only where it is really necessary - body and hands diffuse maps. Further size increase of any textures will notice only screenarchers on close-up shots.
  
  
[font=Verdana]Compatibility[/font]
  
  
• Obviously this mod is not compatible with other mods that change male character textures and body meshes.
  
• It is compatible with such character enhancements as scars, tintmasks (including warpaints ***except*** lips, read further), brows, beards, eyes, hair. Keep in mind that the mod offers scars and tintmasks in the package.
  
• It is compatible with mods that alters NPCs appearance (like new faces).
  
• If you do want to combine this mod with other texture mods that change characters appearance, please remember that you will most likely get a seam.
  
  
One more thing worth noticing - Skyrim's priority of using files is the following:
  
1) original files are used if there are no mods
  
2) if there is a packed mod (\*.esp with its \*.bsa) and no loose files, packed mod is used instead of original files
  
3) if there are loose files, regardless having packed mod, loose files are used
  
I.e. loose files have highest priority. Then go packed mods.
  
  
This mod does have overlapping files with *TS for Females*:
  
**blankdetailmap.dds** - a blank complexion texture with fixed tint. This is because females use this file from males folder. Identical to TS for Females file. Ok to overwrite, ok not to overwrite, just make sure you are using one from either Tempered Skins.
  
  
**Do not overwrite these files!**
  
*textures/actors/character/male/blankdetail.dds* - **very important**, because it's a corrected neutral gray blank complexion. Original Skyrim file is tinted because of its incorrectly chosen texture format and color shift due to it. Delete or swap this file for something else - and head colour will go wild.
  
*textures/actors/character/male/maleheaddetail\*.dds -* not recommended, though possible. Besides remaking I also removed unwanted tint.
  
*textures/actors/character/character assets/tintmasks/maleheadnord\_lips.dds* and *maleheadredguard\_lips* -  these files were corrected specifically for this mod head textures. They show where lips should be coloured.
  
  
**Tempered Skins for Oldrim - made a test package, check Files tab**
  
There are several main problems in using this mod in Oldrim:
  
1) Textures format.
  
I used here BC7 format which is far superior to DXT5 (aka BC3) and DXT1 (aka BC1). Oldrim can't handle BC7. So the first task is to resave textures in appropriate formats (normal maps should be uncompressed, rest of the textures - DXT1 or DXT5). This will definitely increase VRAM usage and worsen quality.
  
2) Bodies.
  
• Dressed body, since it's a vanilla one, is supported. It can be taken from certain mod (check Credits). Or vanilla one can be used with male feet nifs from old Better Males.
  
• Nude body meshes are not compatible at all, this exact body has to be put aside (or may be there is a magical backward conversion, I don't know). Oldrim flaccid Better Males body can be used instead.
  
3) Texture mapping.
  
• Dressed body texture should be compatible. No edits required.
  
• Nude - will not, since current nude body is mapped a little bit different around shins. There will be seems. Or legs from dressed textures can be used, that should fix it, but it require edits in Photoshop/GIMP.
  
• Shins should be ok with SOS body because this mod nude body (from Better Males SE) seems to be using legs from SOS. But SOS Light has different penis mapping. SOS full though may be more friendly but still can be seems around penis.
  
4) SOS Light edition should be compatible with this mod SOS Light edition after texture resaving.
  
  
So, it can be used in theory, but it's a huge amount of routine work which I'm ~~not ready to do~~ doing planning to release Oldrim version soon.
