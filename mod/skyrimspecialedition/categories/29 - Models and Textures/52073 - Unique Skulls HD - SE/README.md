-Available in 8K/4K/2K and 1K.
  
-The gems inside the skull keys glow and pulsate.
  
-The jaw moves for most of the skulls like the vanilla skull does.
  
  
-EnbLight Patch available for the skull keys.
  
-Patch for Skyrim Unique Treasures (covers all the skulls even the ones which appear to be unavailable in-game so you could also use those as ressources if you want to, they rely on the textures from the Clockwork patch in my skeleton replacer as well as the textures from my gemstones replacer for the crystal skulls).
  
-Previous LOTD Bloody Dark Brotherhood skull textures are still available if you prefer those.
