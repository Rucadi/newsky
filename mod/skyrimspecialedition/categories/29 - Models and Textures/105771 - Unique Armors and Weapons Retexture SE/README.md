**OTHER ARTIFACTS MODS I RECOMMEND USING ALONGSIDE THIS RETEXTURE**
  
  
Artifacts / unique items are obviously a big part of the game that I aim to improve with this retexture. But there are plenty of other mods out there that touch artifacts/unique items in different ways and I want to give a shout-out to a few of my favorites that I would recommend to everyone Of course, none of these are required. 
  
  
**GAMPELAY MOD**[Artificer - An Artifact Overhaul by SimonMagus, Deltarider and Oreo](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99619)﻿
  
  
When it comes to artifact overhauls, Artificer is the one I would recommend. I love all its changes to existing artifacts and newly added ones. I also had the chance to work with Simon, Deltarider and Oreo to add an optional texture addon to give custom visuals to artifacts that are normally copies of vanilla items
  
  
[House of Horrors - Quest Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57285)﻿ & [The Only Cure - Quest Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57683)﻿ by JaySerpa
  
  
I am a big fan of JaySerpa's work and would recommend all their mods. They all add immersion and fun new twists to existing Skyrim content.
  
  
[Royal Armory - New Artifacts by PrivateEye](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6994)This mod gives unique named weapons to various important NPCs. All these new models are great and use vanilla texture paths, meaning they work with my retextures. Overhaul I would recommend all mods by privateEye!
  
  
**VISUALS NOT COVERED BY MY RETEXTURE**I decided not to cover any non-weapon or armor artifact. This means I did not cover Azura's star and the skeleton key. Here are my favorite existing retextures for the items that I think would fit well with my style of textures:
  
  
[Azuras Star and Skeleton Key Remastered SE by dpillari](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44446)﻿
  
[RUSTIC AZURA'S STAR by Gamwich](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18345)[Another Azura's Star Retexture by Darenii](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99467)﻿
  
[Elsopa - Azura's Star Redone SE by Elsopa﻿](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72011)﻿
  
[Elsopa - Skeleton Key Redone by Elsopa](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85504)﻿
