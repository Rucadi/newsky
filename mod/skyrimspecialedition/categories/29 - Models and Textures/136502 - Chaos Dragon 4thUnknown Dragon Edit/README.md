# Chaos Dragon 4thUnknown Dragon Edit
- Author: PLSET
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/136502


All Chaos Dragons based on vanilla dragon models have been adjusted appropriately, I have tried to Reproduce the original dragon model style as much as possible (but not guaranteed).
  
The texture files are large, because work based on the original 8k textures.
  
The optional file has a 4k texture compressed version.
  
The Chaos Dragon model based on the serpent Dragon model has not been replaced.
  
  
（This mod is ESL marked, no need to take up precious ESP slot）
