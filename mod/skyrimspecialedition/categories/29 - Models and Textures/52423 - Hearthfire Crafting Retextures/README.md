This is a retexture of the 2 crafting workbenches, drafting table and plans, hinge, iron fittings, nails and also the lock if you want it. Done entirely in photoshop from scratch, used shadermap for the normals. Added a better looking drawer to the large crafting table. There are minor UV alterations on the crafting tables and also the lock. Environment mapping has been added to the hinge, iron fittings, nails and lock. The tables are 4K, the lock is 4x2K, the rest is 2K with masks 512K.
