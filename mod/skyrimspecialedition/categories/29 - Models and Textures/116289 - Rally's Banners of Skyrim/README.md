﻿Complete overhaul of all Banners in Skyrim including the DLCs.
  
  
I wanted to do this for a long time and finally found the time. My aim was to recreate the vanilla Banners by keeping the games aesthetics and original designs and make them look handmade rather than printed. It features all new textures, with different fabrics. The added embroidery, stitching and sewing are drawn by hand.
  
Available in 4K and 2K.
  
  
The textures of the Dark Brotherhood and Nightingale banners, share multiple objects in the vanilla game, so i created new textures with custom paths and included the banner meshes to circumvent this problem and increase compatibility with overhauls of these locations. 
  
  
Optional patches with new banners available for
  
Falskaar
  
Helgen Reborn
  
JK Castle Volkihar
  
 Legacy of the Dragonborn 
  
Moonpath to Elsweyr
  
Northern Roads
  
Vigilant
  
Wintersun
  
Wyrmstooth 
  
  
**The Screenshots and Showcase have been made with Cathedral Weathers, ELFX and Pi-Cho ENB**
