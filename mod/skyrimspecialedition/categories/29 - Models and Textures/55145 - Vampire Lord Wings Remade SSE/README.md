**Introduction**
  
Do you think the Vampire Lord could be great if only the wings were a little closer to something resembling bat wings? Do you have a favourite Vampire lord retexture? Have you tried other mods and found they deviate too far from the original concept for the Vampire Lord or have been left slightly disappointed by the end result? If so please give my mod a try.
  
  
The concept is simple with my mod, recreate the Vampire Lord wings so they look functional and fearsome while also being compatible with any of the great retextures available on the Nexus, I hope I have achieved that goal.
  
**What the mod does**
  
  
this mod replaces the vanilla Vampire Lord meshes (male, female, base armours and king and queen armours) with my new meshes. I have completely recreated the wings and wing membranes so they look more usable. 
  
**Compatibility**
  
  
My mod should be compatible with any mod that doesn't change or affect the Vampire Lord meshes as all textures used are the original Bethesda files, any mod that simply changes the texture files should work nicely with this but if you find one that doesn't please let me know.
  
  
For people using Avike's texture pack ([Vampire Lord Retexture at Skyrim Special Edition Nexus - Mods and Community (nexusmods.com)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8402)) please download both the main file and the optional file labelled Compatibility Patch For Vampire Lord Retexture by Avike.
  
  
**Shout Out**Here's an excellent mod made by Plozaq called Vampire Lord and Lady Revamp that makes serval mesh changes that improves many aspects of the Vampire Lord body shape and includes my wings:

I want to give a big thank you to all the users who have helped me with support, information, endorsements and kind comments, you guys rock. I also want to give a special thank you to AI99, they really helped me get the mod finished. I was just spinning my wheels trying to get the shaders working properly on this mod and they swooped in like a hero and showed me how to get it done, I couldn't have finished the mod to the point I would be happy to release it to the nexus without them, if you guys see them in my comment section please show them some love, they are what makes the nexus community great and I think we could all do with an AI99 in our lives.
  
  
To AI99
  
  
Keep being you my friend, thank you so much for the help and encouragement you've given me, you're Awesome.
