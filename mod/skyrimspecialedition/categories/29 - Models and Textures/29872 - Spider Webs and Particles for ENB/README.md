[/font][font=Comic Sans MS]High Quality Texture Replacer for the Spider Webs and Particles. 
  
Original Spider Web Textures created by hectrol. 
  
I just reworked them so they react better to ENB lighting.
  
The Main Reason was to make these Textures better working with ENB and ELFX.
  
Same for the new HQ Particle Textures.
  
So they may look different with other lighting mods and ENB Presets.
