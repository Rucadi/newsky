Reach mountain moss is one of those vanilla objects, not yet touched by most texture replacers.
  
Not anymore! This mod will replace the moss with [Renthal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/5851384?)'s model and texture.
  
  
Reach moss added by mods that also uses this model will benefit as well, for example [Trees in cities](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1941)(Riften Market in the screenshots above)and [Old Hroldan Ruins](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10134)﻿.
