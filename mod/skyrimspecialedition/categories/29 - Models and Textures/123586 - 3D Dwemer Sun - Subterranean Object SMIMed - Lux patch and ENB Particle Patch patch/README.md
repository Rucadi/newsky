**Description**
  

  
* Bethesda made a ball
wSkeever made it 3D
  
* koschack showed us how to particle patch it
I uploaded it™
  

  
This is an ENB particle patch patches for wSkeever's [3D Dwemer Sub - Subterranean Object SMIMed](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/121858). An optional file is available with a dimmer Blackreach sun to make the lighting consistent with Lux.
  
  
**Options**
  
**Main File: 3D + Particle Patch**
  

  
* **Details**: Mesh updates to allow ENB to manage glow settings. Image comparison courtesy of [koschack](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/koschack/about-me?gameId=1704)﻿, who also provided the instructions I followed for how to particle patch.
**Requirements**: **None**, technically. This is just an edited mesh. ENB is recommended to take advantage of particle effects.
  

  
**Optional File: Lux (Blackreach only)**
  

  
* **Details**: Lux has their own (2D) blackreachsun01.nif. Changing shader flags & emissive multiple of the particle patched mesh makes our new 3D sun consistent with Lux.

  
**Installation**
  
These are asset replacements, which are safe to enable/disable mid save. See the mod images for a preview.
  
  
**ENB / Reshade settings**
  
I use a customized version of the Nolvus reshade ini for PI-CHO enb. I also use a DLSS upscaler. YMMV depending on your own configs.
