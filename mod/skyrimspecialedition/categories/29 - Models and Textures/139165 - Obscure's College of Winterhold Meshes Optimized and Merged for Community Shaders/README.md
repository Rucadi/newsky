Since Community Shaders with Light Limit Fix has eliminated the need to partitioned/split meshes for better lighting effect, CS users can skip most of Lux's vanilla mesh replacer for example. Which comes with the benefit of better performance in terms of drawcall.
  
  
Obscure's College of Winterhold is my favorite college overhaul and it is made with heavily split custom meshes for lighting, since I have migrated to CS, I have thought it would make sense to merge them to reduce drawcall cost.
  
  
The meshes tweaks in [Praedy's College of Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46334)﻿ are also supported, including the repaired bridge, texture tweaks, and window options.
  
  
This is a direct mesh replacer and should be compatible with everything, load it after OCW and Praedy's. (Also Lux, you should hide or delete most meshes from Lux and its patches if they are overriding existing files anyway.)
  
  
The meshes haven't been sufficiently tested since I am still building my LO, but it shouldn't cause any serious issue, as it's just meshes replacers and easy to remove/add mid-playthrough.
