The hat modified by this mod are:
  

  
* Chef Hat
Jester Hat
  
* Cicero Hat
Merchant Hat
  
* Fine Hat

Only the humanoid versions are touched (~~No lizard people or talking cats~~). Probably will make a version for these species. Next updates will have better sizes.
  
You can suggest me if you want other headgear modded.
  
The mods I used to take the screenshots:
  

  
* FairSkin Complexion.
BD's Armor and Clothes Replacer - CBBE 3BA (3BBB).
  
* Noble Skyrim.
Cathedral Weathers.
  
* Ruby ENB.
Lux Via.
  

I used Body slide and Nifscope, Xedit too.
  
  
version 1.0
  
New High poly Meshes and Argonian and khajiit Support, finally, but cats and lizards hats can look a little ridiculous
