**[font=Bebas\_Neuebook]LOST RACES OF Nirn - Female skin Textures[/font]**

  
If there's two things I absolutely love it's new race mods and SimonRim-adjacent gameplay, so [TateTaylorOH](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/61720101)'s [Lost Races of Nirn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69467) is almost custom made for me. I say "almost" because the downside of being so vanilla-friendly is that the included textures are straight outta 2011 in a way that is also incompatible with most body replacers. My aesthetics-obsessed self could not have that, so this is what I did.
  
  
Textures are adapted from the fantastic [Reverie Skin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64314) by [Novelyst](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/100685828) with a tiny bit of [Bijin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20078) thrown in for good measure, and they'll work for both Snow and Sea Elves since they share assets. The installer includes options for both UNP and CBBE-based bodies and is available in 4K and 2K versions.
  
  
  
***Why tho?***
  
I like to be pretty.
  
  
***Does this work with vanilla bodies?***
  
UNP textures are mostly compatible with vanilla bodies, so yes, kind-of, though you should probably [grab this](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20517) as well.
  
  
***Why do you need a plugin for textures?***
  
Prior to version 3.0+ Lost Races used custom normal maps for Snow Elf heads but vanilla normal maps for the body, which lead to neck seams depending on installed texture mods. Version 3.0+ fixed this by recycling vanilla normal maps but now at the risk of mismatch between normal and diffuse textures.
  
  
In either case, the (esl-flagged) plugin fixes these potential issues by assigning a complete set of normal maps to match the new diffuse textures, but if you'd rather not wrangle yet another slot in your load order not using it won't set your PC on fire or anything.
  
  
***Does this cover eyes/eyebrows/warpaints?***
  
Not at this moment, but maybe in the future.
  
  
***Will you be doing male Snow Elves?***
  
Probably not, as least for now, because a lot of male texture overhauls already cover Snow Elves. This is just filling in the gap.
  
  
***Will you be covering the other races in Lost Races?***
  
Not ETA but I'd like to eventually, at least for the Tsaeci ~~and finally have an excuse to import my husband Thane Krios into Tamriel. ?~~
