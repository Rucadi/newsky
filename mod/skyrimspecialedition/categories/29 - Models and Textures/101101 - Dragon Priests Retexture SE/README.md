**DESIGN PHILOSOPHY**
  
  
I wanted the masks to look fairly simple. I personally do not like how most retextures give them fancy, complex designs. I feel like these masks should look mysterious and intimidating. I also really want to make it clear what metal they are made from. In vanilla, each mask uses a different ingot for tempering. I based my designs on this. So, for example, Hevnoraak uses an iron ingot, so I matched its textures to my iron armor retexture. Vokun uses a steel ingot so I matched the steel plate armor, Rahgot matches Orcish armor, etc. And all hoods have the same simple design all that changes is the colors.
  
  
For the dragon priests, I wanted them to match their masks. I really love these enemies so I wanted to make each one stand out. They each have the same color schemes as their KA robes but while the robes are clean (as you use magic to remove the curse on them / make them wearable), the priests' robes are old, dirty and damaged
  
**WHAT IS INCLUDED?**
  
  
This mod retextures all vanilla dragon priest masks and gives them custom hoods. I also replace their meshes to give each masks cubemap reflections and unique textures (in vanilla, most masks did not have cubemap reflections, shared the same normal map and all shared the same hood). It also retextures the Dragonborn DLC masks (Ahzdial, Dukaan and Zahkriisos), Miraak's mask, outfit, sword and staff, the cultist robes, dragon priest staves and dagger, and dragon priest NPCs (regular dragon priests and the 3 Dragonborn DLC priests).
  
  
Morokei and Nahkriin both have multiple options to choose from.
  
  
This mod also contains an optional [SPID](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869) addon to make every named dragon priest have a custom texture.
  
  
This mod contains a full replacer for the robes, gloves and boots from [Konahrik's Accoutrements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22206), the mask textures are also redone but their meshes are untouched. The outfit meshes are meant to bring them closer to the dragon priest enemies. Thank you to Darenii for helping me create the original armored robes mesh that I used as a base to create these. Contains an ESP-FE plugin
  
  
This mod also contains optional Retextures for  [Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802), [Cloaks of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6369) and [Wyrmstooth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45565).
  
  
This mod contains optional patches for [Improved Closeface helmets](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/824), [Warmonger Armory](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17809) and [Refrozen Stalhrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41348)**CREDITS**I used Cabal's [Amidianborn Book of silence](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35382) vanilla dragon priest masks and vanilla Dragon priest npc normal maps as a base to create my own.
  
I used Cuyima's [Dovah Sonaak - Dragon Priest Masks SE's](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23251) Mask meshes as a starting point to create my own and also included their eye-slit masks as an option
