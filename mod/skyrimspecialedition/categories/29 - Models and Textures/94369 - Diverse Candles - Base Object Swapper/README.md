Hi everyone!
  
  
First things first, a BIG thank you to [rudy102](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/93362) for allowing me to make this mod in the first place. The candle meshes that I've tweaked are from Rudy's [Rudy HQ - Miscellaneous SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19867). You'll need to install Rudy's mod first for this one to work properly. My mod doesn't contain any textures and so you'll have purple candles if you don't. This is a Base Object Swapper mod and so you'll need [powerofthree](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/2148728)'s [Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805) installed too. 
  
  
Have you ever noticed in vanilla Skyrim that the candles on plates are the same wherever you go? They've always burned to the same length, they're not thinner, thicker, or even out. Candlesticks, too. They've got the same three candles wherever you travel. It becomes particularly noticeable when you visit a location that has several candlesticks together such as the Temple of Kynareth in Whiterun. Well, this mod aims to fix that. Using Base Object Swapper, I've added fifteen different variations of glazedcandlesstatic02.nif (that's the big plate of candles), and ten variations for the smaller candle plate (glazedcandles01.nif). I've also created 10 variations of each of the tall and short single candlesticks and ten variations on the Imperial candlestick. I've set the candles to change each time you reload a cell and so they'll also be different when you revisit locations too, giving a sense of them having been burned and replaced. 
  
  
TLDR: You'll see a lot more varied candles around Skyrim! Check out the gallery for more images and a better idea of what you can expect.
  
  
This mod wouldn't be possible without Rudy and powerofthree, please be sure to download the required files, endorse them, and give the authors some kudos for their work.
  
  
Thank you for checking out the mod!
