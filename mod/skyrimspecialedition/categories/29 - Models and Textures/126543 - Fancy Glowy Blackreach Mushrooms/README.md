Modified meshes from [Blackreach Tentacle Mesh Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43083)﻿,﻿ [High Poly Blackreach Mushrooms](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40418)﻿ and [Subdivide and Smooth - Vines](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/101926) with a stronger glow and some variation in color. I chose colors that still worked with the original aesthetics, and didn't mismatch with any lights placed on them.
  
Each shroom, excluding the giant "epic" shroom and small harvestable shroom, comes in two variations: one more green, and one more blue. [Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805) decides which is which. Swaps are persistent.
  
Without BOS, they will all be the more blue variant.
  
  
Compatible with retextures. These changes are defined in the models.
  
No particle lights or other such effects are used. It all works with the vanilla lighting.
  
  
*Covers:*
  

  
* All glowing Blackreach mushrooms.
All glowing mushrooms in Darkfall Passage.
  
* Random glowing mushrooms in some dungeons.
(These are all the same assets.)
  
* Floor vines.
Harvestable shrooms & ingredient item.
  
* [Blackreach Shroom Beetles](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69828)﻿﻿ & associated loot.
[Blackreach frogs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120998)﻿.
  

  
I find all this glowy stuff looks best with [Rally's Blackreach Mushrooms](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29179), and against darker caverns. I thought the contrast of near pitch black and bright funky colors was an interesting look.
  
Anything that mixes up the Blackreach flora goes a long way, too.
