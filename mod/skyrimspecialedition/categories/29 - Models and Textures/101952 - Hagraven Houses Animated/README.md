This Base Object Swapper made mod replaces the Hagraven House and Fence Meshes with animated ones (using a vanillia meshs that I've split and vertex painted) making it look like they are rustling in the breeze.
  
  
(I'm getting a little bit of clipping, but no matter how much i vertex paint I dont seem to be able to get rid of it, it isn't terrible just annoying)
