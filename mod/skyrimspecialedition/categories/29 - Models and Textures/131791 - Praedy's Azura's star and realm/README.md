* Unique models for Azura's star featuring particle effects, lights and complex parallax material.
Azura's realm now has 3 variants has seen in the screenshots, during the quest her realm will have a mix of blue and purple symbolizing the ongoing corruption of her realm, at the end of the quest her realm will either change to white for the good ending or dark purple for the evil ending.
  
* You will be given a spell at the end of the quest to return back to her realm whenever you want, a portal there will take you to Azura's shrine whenever you want to leave.
I've added another option which adds soul gem deposits inside her realm so you will have a reason to travel back to it if you want. (I recommend hitting the deposits with your pickaxe instead of letting the mining animation play).
