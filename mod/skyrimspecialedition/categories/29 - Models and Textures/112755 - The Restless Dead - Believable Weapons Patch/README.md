# The Restless Dead - Believable Weapons Patch

Ever since playing The Restless Dead, I've had fun with the variety and new content added. However, it was not consistent with weapon replacer mods I use, such as Believable Weapons. So I was able to replace the original mesh files in TRD with BW's weapons, for consistency. I used nifskope to add textures to the new meshes.
  
  
Requires: 
  
 [The Restless Dead](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/94100) - Absolutely required, the meshes of this mod are being replaced.
  
[Believable Weapons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37737) - Not necessarily a hard requirement, but almost pointless without it.
  
  
Installation:
  
Install with your preferred mod manager, or manually, if you live on the edge. Though not required, it is highly recommended to use a mod manager. (MO2, Vortex, etc)
  
  
Conflicts: 
  
Any other mod that replaces the meshes in The Restless Dead.

Happy modding!
