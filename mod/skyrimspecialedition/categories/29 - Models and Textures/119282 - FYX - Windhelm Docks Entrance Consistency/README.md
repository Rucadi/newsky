# FYX - Windhelm Docks Entrance Consistency

As I rarely pass by there, I never noticed that the entrance was different on each side. The interior side is destroyed, the exterior side is brand new.

Even if it is not impossible to have two different designs, we should at least notice it from the inside, otherwise this is not the case.
  
I tried to correct this by choosing the destroyed design because I prefer it.^^
