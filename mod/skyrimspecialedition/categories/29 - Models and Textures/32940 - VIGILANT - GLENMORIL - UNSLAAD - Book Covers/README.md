**[font=Verdana]FEATURES[/font]**
  
  
Adds Covers to all Books, Journals and Notes in the mod VIGILANT/GLENMORIL.
  
  
Note: I'm not half as good as original author of the Book Covers, I mostly used existing resources.
  
I wanted to make Vigilant books look different - hence this mod.
  
  
It's was made for English addon, but you can use it with Vigilant original machine translation too.
  
Tho I strongly suggest grabbing Eng Addon, if you're eng speaking.
  
This mod only change "Book" Records, adding different cover images to it. That's it.
