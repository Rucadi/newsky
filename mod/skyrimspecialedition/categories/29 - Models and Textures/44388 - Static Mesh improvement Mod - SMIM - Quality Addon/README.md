# Static Mesh improvement Mod - SMIM - Quality Addon

I always loved the SMIM mod, it has many many must have files for every skyrim installation for over 8 years.
  
So I decided to add some improvements to it.
  
  
- This mod adds environment/cubemaps (better moving reflections) to many SMIM files. Metal parts look way better now.
  
The difference is way more noticeable in motion, than in pictures
  
  
- So far ~50 objects, I will add another 50 in the next versions
  
Performance impact: Less than 1 frame
  
  
Next versions:
  
- Textures with less compression
  
- A few higher Res textures
  
- A few more polygons here and there
  
  
Maybe I will add some parallax in the future

FAQ:
  
a) Separate from my other mods, use this along side Skyrim 2020
  
b) load order with my other mods doesn't matter
  
1. Which of the different SMIM quality options does this mod contain?
  
- Always the highest
  
2. dg\_cubemap.dds is my redundant cubemap for reflections, like in my other mods. Overwrite or not, doesn't matter.
  
  
**Installation: Just overwrite SMIM with this or have it later in the load order if you created one**
  
  
  
  
**Requirements:** SMIM - duh
  
Got purple stuff? It says Requirements
  
  
**Many thanks to Brumbek for creating his wonderful mod and adding so much stuff over the years <3**
