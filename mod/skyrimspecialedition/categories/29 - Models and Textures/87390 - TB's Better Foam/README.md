**FAQ**
  
  
Does this mod fill up a .esp slot?
  
No, it replaces the meshes/textures only while supplying its own texture paths for the changed models so as not to conflict with any other mods for any new textures
  
  
Where should this be placed in my load order?
  
After any conflicting mods - textures for Nif models will not interfere with any other textures as they have their own private directory
  
  
What ENB are you using?
  
Rudy ENB with Obsidian Weathers and Seasons
  
  
What format do my textures use?
  
BC7 (Linear, DX11+) + Mipmaps for all my texture files for high-quality compression
  
  
Do I take suggestions?
  
Yes suggestions are much appreciated, although I may not do all of them
  
  
**Texture/Nif-making process**
  
Textures have to be converted from PBR to the Skyrim Engine (Gamebryo) using my own custom method if you have any questions or queries about how this then feel free to message me about your question(s) [here](https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/59554526-theblenderanimator/).
