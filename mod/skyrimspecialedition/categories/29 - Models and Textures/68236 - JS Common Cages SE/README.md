**Featured on** [**PC Gamer**](https://www.pcgamer.com/behold-the-skyrim-mod-you-didnt-know-you-needed-4k-cages/)

**What this mod includes:**
  
  
• New Meshes & Textures for Prisoner Cage, Animal Cage, Hanging Cage & Ship Anchor Chain
  
• Updated with collisions that allow items & projectiles to pass through bar gaps
  
• New Dead Bolt animations (the vanilla Prisoner Cage's lock is only attached to the door handle, not the cage itself)
  
• Optimized chain meshes (86% lower than SMIM)
  
  
**Note:** Because these are larger items, the 4k version is recommended. They do not include an \_M file, so they use less space/vram.

**FAQ:**
  
  
1) Why doesn't it line up perfectly in location x?
  
• These have been made to fit the vanilla positions & dimensions for compatibility, if something doesn't line up properly in game, it's because it wasn't aligned properly in the first place.
