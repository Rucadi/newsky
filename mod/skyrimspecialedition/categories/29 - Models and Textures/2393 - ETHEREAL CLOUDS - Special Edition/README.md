[font=Verdana]Ethereal Clouds is a lore-friendly retexture of the clouds of Skyrim. My goal was to make cloud textures that are neutral in appearance, so they will blend with any lighting mods, while adding more visual interest than the default Bethesda clouds. The default clouds can appear to be too much of a flat plane, so I tried to get a greater feeling of depth to the cloud masses. I also tried to get a real separation between the lower clouds and the upper clouds. The upper clouds should now appear to be further up in atmosphere. I also added a little more drama to the storm cloud texture to make your rain and snow storms a touch more ominous.[/font]
  
  
[font=Verdana]Clouds are probably the most variable texture in the game, since people are using many different lighting mods for the vanilla game, as well as ENBs (which can change the cloud appearance pretty drastically). I tried to create something that would look good under many different lighting conditions.
  
  
UPDATE 3.0: This revision fixes the issue with seams being visible on the textures. This was especially noticeable with the cloudsheet01 texture. Everything should appear now as intended.
  
  
UPDATE 2.0: Ethereal Clouds is now available in BC7 compression to give the cleanest appearance possible. There is a 4K option for people with a lot of VRAM to burn. I made some small tweaks to the clouds and hopefully eliminated any seaming issues some people were experiencing. 2K is the default size that will work well for most people. 1K is still an option for people with low-end PCs. It's the same size as the original textures, but will still have more details.
