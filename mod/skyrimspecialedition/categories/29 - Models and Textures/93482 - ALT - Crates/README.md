# ALT - Crates

Hi !
  
  
Initially, it was not intended to be a mod. It was a personal exercise.
  
It almost never happens to me to create something from A to Z, most of the time I just do edits. And I wanted to practice on modern dynamic texturing software.
  
I wanted to start with something simple, Skyrim crates seemed good to me as a base.
  
So the goal was to start from scratch, recreate 3D crates but with a different design, make a more high poly model to bake UV, then start learning dynamic texturing. Make textures more natural, less salmon pink and chicken diarrhoea green...
  
  
After some research on Nexus I couldn't find any mods that replaced crates, so I thought this exercise might be suitable for someone else.

* This mod replaces Vanilla crates with an Alternative version with their own texture.
The boxes of the East Empire Company have their own design.
  
* Meshes have fewer polygons than vanilla meshes and have a single BSTriShape.
The textures are in 2K for the small crates and 4K for the long ones.
  
* The ESP is there to swap the textures of the "Weathered" meshes. NO Cell edit. Flagged ESL
Base Object Swapper Version
  
* A patch for [Dynamic Things Alternative - Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60741) can be found in the optional files.
[DIVERSITY](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/images/194298)﻿ version in optionnal file. 50% Vanilla Crates 50% ALT Crates (Works with all mods that retexture vanilla crates)
