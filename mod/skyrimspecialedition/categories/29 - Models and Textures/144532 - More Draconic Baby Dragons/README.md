Exactly what it says on the tin! Right now this is just a texture replacer, so it should be safe to add in at any time. Just install it after the Baby Dragons mod somewhere!
  
  
I might do a vocal file for slightly less cutesy sounds as well, to go with the more piercing eyes, but I am unsure when or if I'll do that as of yet.
  
  
All credit for almost everything goes to [HanShotFirst](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/hanshotfirst01?gameId=1704) for the Baby Dragon mod and textures, as well as CD Projekt (courtesy of [Oaristys](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Oaristys?gameId=1704)) for their Witcher 3 eye textures that I used as a baseline for my eye edits. I just did some tinkering with the textures.
