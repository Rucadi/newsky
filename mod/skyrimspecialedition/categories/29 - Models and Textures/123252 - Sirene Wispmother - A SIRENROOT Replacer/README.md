# Sirene Wispmother - A SIRENROOT Replacer

I was unsatisfied with Larelleis looking like yet another run-of-the-mill wispmother you'd find throughout your travels in Skyrim, especially considering she's an Ayleid rather than a Snow Elf. Thanks to a bunch of kind and talented mod authors with open asset permissions, I was able to whip up a far more suiting look for her.
  
  
Already ESL-flagged, so you don't have to worry about this mod taking up an ESP slot. If you find any bugs or other issues, do let me know so that I can fix them!
