Textures are 2k except Chest armor textures, which are 4k.
  
  
Half-res version available in Optional files (Chest, weapons and shields are 2k, everything else is 1k)

**FOMOD OPTIONS**

  

**﻿**

**CHOOSE WHAT TO INSTALL**

  
Pick and choose which vanilla retextures you want and which CC retextures you want to use.
  
  
  
  

**CUBEMAP ADDON - HEAVY IMPERIAL ARMOR**
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/oaUJLtL.jpeg)
  
This option adds cubemap reflections to the heavy imperial armor. This effect is hard to see in a screenshot, but it adds metallic-looking reflections. This option will overwrite all imperial heavy armor meshes. Patches will be necessary for any mesh replacers, including bodyslides. Permissions are open for anyone to create such patches. A patch is available for [Improved closefaced helmets](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/824)﻿
  
  
**SLEEVES AND PANTS**
  
Decide if you want to add pants and/or sleeves to any of the following sets. Patches will be necessary for bodyslides. Any bodyslide patches made for pre-2.0 version of this mod will not work and potentially crash your game. Only install patches specifically made for 2.0.0 or newer.
  
[HDT-SMP Vanilla armors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/142450)﻿ patches available in the FOMOD

[/u]
  
Decide if you would like to add pants to these 2 sets. Requires new meshes and an esl-flagged esp. The Penitus Oculatus doesn't have its own meshes, so a plugin is needed to link the correct textures.
  
  
**Lord's Mail - no sleeves or pants

Decide if you would like to add pants to this set. My meshes will overwrite whatever chest meshes you currently have for this set.

**GENERAL FALX CARIUS WEARABLE ARMOR ADDON**
  
[u]General Falx Carius' armor
  
  
**Textures only (only retextures the chest piece worn by the NPC, no plugin)**

**Optional Wearable Falx Carius' Armor addon (adds a plugin that makes the set fully unique and makes all piece lootable and wearable)**

[/u]
  
This optional addon contains an esl-flagged esp that completes the General Falx Carius set (vanilla only had him wear a custom cuirass and basic imperial for the rest). It also makes the set lootable from his corpse, adds a female version and makes the set temperable. The heartstone is an amulet, you can choose to wear it or not. This set is a heavy armor.
  
  
  
**CONSISTENCY PATCHES**
  
These are optional retextures for some of my favorite mods. All the original mods are required and while I took inspiration from the originals, none of these textures used any parts of the original textures found in these mods.

**Imperial Outcast - No Pants or sleeves

![](https://i.imgur.com/vmVjtOk.jpeg)
  
  
  
  
Retextures the Imperial outcast set from [Amidian Content Addon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35390). Shares meshes with the Light imperial set, so it will have sleeves if you selected the option for the vanilla sets. Needed an esl-flagged esp to apply the sleeves texture. If you chose the no-sleeves version, there won't be any plugins
