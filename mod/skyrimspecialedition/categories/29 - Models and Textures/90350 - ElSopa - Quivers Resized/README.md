# ElSopa - Quivers Resized

Inspired by SoulMasters quiver resize mod, I went ahead and did the same for my favorite mod author... [ElSopa](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/6960827)!
  
  
Resizes the quivers down by 10% or 25% of their original size. There is another version that adds ENB effects to the bound arrow in the misc. files, also shrunk by 10% or 25%.
  
  
Requires the [original mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65921) to function (duh). Will also require [ENB](http://enbdev.com/download_mod_tesskyrimse.html) for the optional ENB file.
  
  
Be sure to endorse ElSopa and download more of his awesome mods!
  
  
Please also consider supporting [Mur4s4me](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3126484) for their [ENB light mod,](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65070) also highly recommended, I used his lovely bound arrow ENB version.
