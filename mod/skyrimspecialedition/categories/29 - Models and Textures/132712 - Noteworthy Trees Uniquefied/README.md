# Noteworthy Trees Uniquefied

**Currently included:**
  
  
- The Nchuand-Zel tree, making it metal, because it's in dwemer ruins and all that. Uses the textures in your LO so it'll suit its surroundings.

- The random tree in college Arch-Mage Quarters. It already had a unique reference in game files so I suspect they wanted something unique here. I added a mystical, whimsical vibe to it. Includes textures, rather HQ but the tree's in a cell with 60fps guarantee so who cares.

- Can make more as long as the tree in question is unique enough to warrant such and I have some form of inspiration to do something about it. Feel free to inform me of such trees. Will consider some other variations of these two trees too, admittedly the metal sheet tree is a bit comical.
  
  
**Compatibility:**
  
  
Should be compatible with everything. If not, let me know. The models follow vanilla dimensions (roughly).
  
  
Some college mods may do something else to the tree there. Nevertheless you wont break your game with this, follow load order discipline to make the most out of your game.
  
  
The mod is modular in nature, install what you want, don't install what you don't want. Install/uninstall whenever. ESL flagged.
