I sculpted from scratch a couple meshes I found in [Northern Roads](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77530)﻿. A more realistic approach more suited for my staste, maybe others would like it too.
  
It looks more detailed but the meshes are actually way simpler, some stone meshes went from 4k triangles to 1k triangles, resulting in improved performance.
  
(yeah the game can handle a lot of geometry, but this is 2023 and most systems are pushing the hardware to it's limits, **LESS GEOMETRY IS ALWAYS BETTER**)
  
-The new floor texture uses complex parallax, works anyways if you don't use ENB.
  
-I edited the wood texture used by the wooden cridges, I darkened it and lowered the saturation.
  
-I included custom LODs but couldn't test them, delete them if you dont like.
  
There's two versions:
  
4k-2k: 4k textures for the totem/stone meshes, and 2k for ground and wooden texture.
  
2k: everything 2k.
