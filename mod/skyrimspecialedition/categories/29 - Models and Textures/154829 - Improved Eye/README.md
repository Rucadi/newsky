**Description**
  
  
An attempt to improve [Cumulative fix for Eye Meshes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71524) mod. Includes the same fixes with some of my tweaks.
  
  
This mod should work with your favorite eye texture mods as long as they use vanilla paths, such as [The Eyes of Beauty](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16185). Personally I use [Eyes Nouveaux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/131210), but only the textures (No mesh and plugin).﻿
  
  
If you want the same fix for the NPCs, you have to generate facegen with Creation Kit with this mod active in your load order.
  
Here's a tutorial on how to generate facegen for the NPC [VHR Facegen Tutorial](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/1647).
  
  
In theory, this mod ([Face Discoloration Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42441)﻿) should also distribute the mesh to NPCs at runtime, but need further test.
  
  
**Features** 
  
  

  
* Fixes the eye mesh issue underwater.
Fixes the eye mesh glowing unnaturally under shadows.
  
* Tweaks to the eye lashes transparency so they look more natural.
Remove glow from vampire eyes. There's an optional file to keep them.
  

  
**Installation**
  
  
Install with your mod manager.
  
Generate facegen with Creation Kit if you want the NPCs to have the same fix.
  
  
  
**FAQ**
  
  
Q : Why you do this?
  
A : Cause the old eye lashes were thicker than a bowl of oatmeal. Also eyes glow in the dark scares me.
