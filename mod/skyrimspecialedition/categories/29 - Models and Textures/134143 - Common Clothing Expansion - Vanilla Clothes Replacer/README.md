# Common Clothing Expansion - Vanilla Clothes Replacer
- Author: Hornclonic and H Shirlock
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/134143


**DESCRIPTION**
  
Swaps all vanilla farm clothes models and the vanilla farmer cowl with variants from [Common Clothing Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/134088)﻿. Includes male and female swaps. Should be compatible with everything, including all patches for [Common Clothing Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/134088)﻿. Model swaps will not affect new outfits added by other mods.
  
  
(Optional): I found the new clothes to be too bright when a lot of NPCs are wearing them outside together. Alternate textures with darker highlights are available in the optional files section if you think you need them.

  

**Swapped:**
  
  
FarmClothes01 -> Common Clothes Tunic/Dress4
  
  
FarmClothes02 -> Common Clothes Tunic2/Dress2
  
  
FarmClothes03 -> Common Clothes Tunic/Dress
  
  
FarmClothes04 -> Common Clother Tunic3/Dress3
  
  
FarmHat03 -> Common Clothes Hood
