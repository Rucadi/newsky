**[font=Arial][size=5][font=Lucida Sans Unicode][color=#3d85c6]﻿[/font]Description[/color]**[/font][/size]Ruins Clutter Improved started as a retexturing project, with the main goal to improve some of the ugliest objects in the dungeons of Skyrim. It improves the visual experience of catacombs and ruins by adding more detail to common clutter objects like pots, sconces, candles, doors and many other ingame materials.
  
  

Now also availble for Xbox One on [Bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net/de/mods/skyrim/mod-detail/4250246).

Installation

[/color]**[/font][/size]If you downloaded the manual version, you need to unzip and extract the archive into your Skyrim/Data directory.
  
  
If you manually install this mod over [SMIM](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/659/?) you will be prompted to overwrite some files.
  
  
If you are using [ELFX](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2424/?), you will have to overwrite some meshes (catacomb small ways and candlehorn chandeliers). You can do this safely. I tested my meshes in game with [ELFX](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2424/?) activated and there was no light flickering or other issues.
  
  
Since many things have changed compared to version 2.9. I would strongly recommend to do a clean install with the latest version to prevent problems.
