My new mesh and HD textures for **Aretino Family Heirloom**. 
  
  
This is a very simple mod that replaces the vanilla Aretino Family Heirloom (which is no different from an ordinary silver platter) with my model and unique textures. I was always surprised why many unique items in the game look the same as their standard counterparts and have no external differences except for the name? For this reason, I always sold the Aretino heirloom to merchants, since this item had no interest for me. Last night, while playing, I once again completed the Aretino quest, and received this platter as a reward. And then I wanted to change this.
  
Now this item has its own unique look and I proudly decorated my home with it. Perhaps you will like it too?
  
  

[font=Georgia]**Compatability:**[/font]

  
Should be **fully compatible** with anything except mods from other author's that modify the Aretino Family Heirloom.
  
  
**Not compatible** with mods that make any changes to the the *Aretino Family Heirloom.* Also this is not compatible with any other meshes replacers and/or retextures for vanilla **Aretino Family Heirloom**.
  
  
ESP flagged ESL, no scripts. So it absolutely safe to install/uninstall at mid-game (at any time).
  
  
I hope you will like it. Endorsement is very appreciate ?
