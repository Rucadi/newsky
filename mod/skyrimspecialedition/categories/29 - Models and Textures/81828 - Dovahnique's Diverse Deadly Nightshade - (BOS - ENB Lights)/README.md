﻿I figured it was about time I learn to make my own models instead of always hunting for free resources to use and edit. With many days of struggle and some very helpful YouTube tutorials, I bring you brand new Nightshade plants. Models made by me from scratch in Blender, textures made by me in Substance Painter and Photoshop. Five different colors swapping at random thanks to [powerofthree's](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/2148728)﻿ [Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805)﻿. Optional ENB lights that match each plant, thanks to [Rudy102](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/93362)﻿ for the fxglowENB.dds. This model is high poly, but only roughly 6x the triangles (5,246) compared to vanilla nightshade (926) and the performance impact will be unnoticeable for most.

I based the appearance of my nightshade flowers off of the Belladonna Lilly, but then wanted to mix fantasy with reality so I made the flowers big and beautiful, arranged more like garden flowers and not a bush. A plant to draw you in with it's poisonous beauty. The intensity of the ENB lights will vary depending on your chosen ENB. I use [PRT XII](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4743) with the [Next Gen Photorealistic Graphics](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74949)﻿ preset.

﻿1. Make sure you have Base Object Swapper and all of its requirements up to date. If it isn't working and you want to ask for help, please make sure you have double checked that everything is up to date before commenting ([Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805)﻿, [Address Library for SKSE Plugins](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444)﻿, [powerofthree's Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51073))
  
2. Install with your preferred mod manager,﻿ and that's it :)
  
  
 Load after anything changing the Nightshade01 ingredient (example: Skyrim 3D Trees and Plants), if you don't the only thing that will happen is that you won't see the inventory item displayed properly. Patch for [Complete Alchemy and Cooking Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19924)﻿ is available for the ingredient stats to match CACO. Load the patch after this mod and CACO, LOOT will sort this automatically. Textures are 4k by default, 2K optional file available. All plugins are ESL flagged.
