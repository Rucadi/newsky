# Val Serano Wanted Poster Replacers
- Author: Various
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/117210


This mod reworks the textures of the wanted poster in Val Serano's room to match his appearance to some of his character replacer mods. These were created by manipulating screenshots of the respective character replacers then placing them over the original textures from Axarien's mod.
  
  
Pick your favorite, install as normal, and allow to overwrite original textures.

I didn't use any assets from Krimson's video, but I tried to make the portraits reflect this quote from it: 
  
  
"My prototype for how I got into Val was that Val's eyes needed to be looking razor sharp at all times, when I did those lines -- always analyzing. His mouth was always a slight grin even when ajar [...] And then his head would always be in a submissive tilt on purpose. So he'd always tilt his head a little bit just as, like, a ruse, if you will."
