**Frankly HD Dawnguard Armor and Weapons**
  
*"Be on your guard at all times. Avoid sleep if you can... Sleep is for the weak."*
  
*"Constant vigilance!" (kidding)*
  
  
**High resolution (4k and 2k available)** retexture of **Dawnguard's armor and weapons** (the faction, not DLC). Includes all variants of the armor and shield; weapons including **crossbow**, steel bolts and the **unique rune items**. The latter have been made more unique with a glowing lava effect.
  
  
Vanilla normal maps were upscaled with a neural network software leading to much **crisper and clearer details** than one normally gets with upscaling on traditional image editing software.
  
  
**Some meshes had to be modified** for consistent shader settings and to enable enviroment mapping on some meshes that didn't have it. It is therefore **partially compatible with mesh replacers**. Specifically, this involves the weapons and some of the variants of the armor, like those that don't have pauldrons. Helmet replacers are completely compatible. That said, compatibility can be achieved very easily, there are some directions in the sticky comment.
