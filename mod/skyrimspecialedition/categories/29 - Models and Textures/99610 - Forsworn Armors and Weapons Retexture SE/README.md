This mod retextures the Forsworn armor, axe, bow, quiver, arrows, staff and sword. It also contains an optional fix for the vanilla female chest meshes (in vanilla, the feathers appear almost fully black due to heavy clipping. Most mesh replacers and bodyslides fix this issue, only use this if you use 100% vanilla female forsworn meshes), an optional esl-flagged esp to give a custom unique look to the Armor of the old gods and optional consistency retextures for [Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802)'s Eye of melka and Bloodthorn.
  
  
These new textures work with every mod that also works with vanilla Forsworn textures, such as [Heavy armory](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6308), [Animated armory](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35978), etc.

[b][u][size=4]VANILLA FEMALE MESH FIX**[/size][/u][/b]

Fixes the feathers appearing black on the vanilla female chest meshes. This happens because the mesh was modeled so it would not need to be double-sided, but still uses the double-sided flag in nifskope. Meaning the feathers facing inwards cast shadows on the feathers pointing outwards. My fix simply turns off the double-sided flag. Pretty much every mesh replacer or bodyslide conversion also fixes this issue, so this is only necessary if you are using the vanilla meshes.

ARMOR OF THE OLD GODS REPLACER
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/hhOvZNk.png)
  
  
  
In vanilla skyrim, the armor of the old gods is visually identical to the regular forsworn armor. This addon uses an esl-flagged esp to make it use custom textures. The goal of this version was to make it look like the white stag Hircine appears as, in his quest. This addon uses texture sets to apply the new textures, so it works with bodyslides or other mesh replacers that work with vanilla forsworn issues.

LOTD's Armor of the Old Gods uses custom unique display meshes. This mod simply overwrites them so they use my new textures
