# FYX - RowBoat

At the start, I left to smooth the angles more.
  
Then I saw that the UV map of the hull was distorted. I tried to fix it, but there was something wrong, I didn't know what. When I saw a real Row Boat, I understood !
  
The way the boards are placed on the Vanilla mesh is not at all realistic. So I redid almost the entire hull to be able to have a more realistic UV map. And other stuff...
  
  
It seems simple like that, but I really broke my head on this FYX :')
  
  
I kept the original shape as much as possible because otherwise the boat would have been incompatible in many places in the game. On the other hand, I plan to add new row boats one day.
