about PARALLAX
  
  
In simple words, parallax is a advancement of normalmapping,
  
though the depth-information doesn't get simply "drawn" on the surface, it rather warps 
  
the texture itself in the desired direction.
  
You can imagine the parallax-texture as kind of radar map like the NASA ones from Venus.
  
The depth effect can get triangulated out of it.
  
It is not as sophisticated as high end Tessellation and a much older technique, but still nice :)
