This is just a simple mesh replacer for the Hot Stew's included with the Creation Club Survival Mode content, allowing them to use the higher quality meshes from [SMIM](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/659)﻿
  
  
This lets the bowls have a more pleasingly rounded shape, and still retains the steaming effect of the original Hot Stew meshes.
  
  
It's stew...upgraded.
  
  
That's all!
  
  
I hope you enjoy.
