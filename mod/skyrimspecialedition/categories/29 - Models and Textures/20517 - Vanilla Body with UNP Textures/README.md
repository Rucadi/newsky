[size=2]Just a simple mod for all of you vanilla users out there, I'm not one of you but I know there's a lot of you and this took me like 3 minutes to make, so why not... 
  
LE version [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/102012)**What this mod does**[/size]
  
This mod will allow all vanilla body users to use all UNP textures, without the fear of nipples peaking out or feet looking messed up.
  
I have edited tavern outfit, forsworn armor and vampire armor to not show nipples when using UNP textures and I have included all shoe meshes that show parts of the feet.
  
  
The pictures are taken with the UNP version of [Bijin Skin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20078)
  
  
Feel free to use other feet meshes, for example zzay's [﻿FemFeet Redesigned Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32418)﻿ which will just overwrite the feet and shoe meshes here and only use the outfit meshes from this mod.
