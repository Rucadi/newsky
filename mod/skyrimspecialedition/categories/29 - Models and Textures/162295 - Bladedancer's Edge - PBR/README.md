Hi I know I just released this one a bit ago but I've decided to go back to it and revisit it. I love these armors from **[goampuja](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/52114451)**and want them to be the best quality I can make. I learned a lot in the process of making [Asura's Guard - PBR](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/163241)﻿ and wanted to bring those skills and techniques back to this one. I have remade every texture from scratch using my new workflow and I think the results are a big step up from the original that I made. 
  
  
Thanks for downloading and I appreciate an endorsement if you enjoy. 
  
  
  
**Original Install Info**What FOMOD settings you choose for the original install should not matter, these textures are using all the default settings from it. I might include some variations over time like the semi-transparent, and optional color variations but not for sure yet. Let me know if their is any demand for that but otherwise the look you see in the pictures is what you'll get in terms of coloring and transparency.
  
  
  
  
Thanks to Community Shaders/The Cistern discords for their help and guidance.
  
  
**Thanks to [goampuja](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/52114451) for the permissions to use his assets in this conversion and the original obviously. Hopefully more of his armor conversions to come.**Thanks to Polyhaven/AmbientTCG for their open source PBR materials.
