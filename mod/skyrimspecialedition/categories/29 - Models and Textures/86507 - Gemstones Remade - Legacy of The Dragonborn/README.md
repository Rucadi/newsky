**FAQ**
  
> Q: Do I need this if I have lotd v6?
>   
> A: Up to you, this has far higher quality textures than what got taken by the lotd people.﻿
>   
>   
> Q: some of the gems have the same cut as other gems.
>   
> A: there are 105 gems. I already spent more than a year slowly replacing the old models. So I reused some of the cuts. They still have different sizes, textures, and colors.
>   
>   
> Q: some of the gems don't look how I think they should look.
>   
> A: I am not a geologist.
>   
>   
> Q: these gems are mostly cut or polished.
>   
> A: yes.
>   
>   
> Q: why is there a chess piece?
>   
> A: it is an ivory chess piece. I just wanted something different from existing mammoth or horker tusks.
>   
>   
> Q: why are there gold trims on the platinum?
>   
> A: to differentiate it more from steel. Think of it as gold-pressed platinum.
>   
>   
> Q: Is this mod related to *The Gemstone Collector* or *The Gemstone Collector - Mystic Legacy*?
>   
> A: This mod uses entirely new models and textures. I had no idea *LOTD* assets were from *The Gemstone Collector*.
