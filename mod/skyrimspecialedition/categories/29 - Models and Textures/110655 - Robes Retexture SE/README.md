These are optional retextures for some of my favorite mods. All the original mods are required and while I took inspiration from the originals, none of these textures used any parts of the original textures found in these mods. 
  
  
**ARMOR AND CLOTHING EXTENSION
  
By Kryptopyr and Gamwich**
  
  
﻿While I took great inspiration from the original textures made by Gamwich, I did not use any of them in any shape or form during the making of this mod, outside of looking at them for inspiration. My goal was not to improve them, as they are already incredibly well done, but to redesign these robes to fit better with my own style. Please view these as an alternative to the original work and not an attempt at objectively "improving it".
