The original version of this mod is gone from Nexus, so I have rebuilt it from scratch and with permission I have the pleasure of offering JPSteel2's original mesh (that I have vertex alpha painted) and textures along with Rally's tweaked mesh and both light and dark variants in 2k & 4k resolutions is a super simple, easy to use FOMOD.
