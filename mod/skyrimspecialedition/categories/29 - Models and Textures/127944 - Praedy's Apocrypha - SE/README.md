* [size=3]Replaced the 1 book wall texture set with 3 different sets (1 for book piles, 1 for book walls and the last one for the towers of books), textures were made using Book covers Skyrim textures (desaturated option).
  

  
* 3D books on walls and towers now use either a generic book cover texture or one of the book covers from Book Covers Skyrim.

  
* Reduced the amount of 3D books on meshes mentioned previously to compensate for the added 3D books on the rubble / book pile meshes scattered around Apocrypha.

  
* Replaced small black book piles static meshes with book piles using the default book model, each book in these piles uses a different cover, added journals and scrolls to those piles.

  
* Remade from scratch or edited vanilla textures following patterns observed in textures seen in The Elder Scrolls Online: Necrom.

  
* The towers of books and arches have been remade to add another texture set onto them and to make the arches more round, also to reduce the book texture getting squished near the center of the arches.

  
* Hovering light model has been remade to add more tentacles and to make said tentacles look more natural, less symmetrical.

  
* Created 3 new bookshelf models (1 empty, 1 filled with low poly books and the last one with the vanilla book model which is higher poly) and placed those around Apocrypha with the goal of filling empty spaces and to hide repeating patterns such as long series of walls.

  
* Created 2 new "gate" models [1 has a locked door (cannot be opened it's purely visual) the other does not have the doors and is just a passage / doorway] both are statics used with the same goal as the bookshelves.

  
* The gates and bookshelves are based on The Elder Scrolls Online: Necrom.

  
* \_em textures with height maps are provided to add complex parallax for those interested in that.

  
* The included ESPFE plugin adds the bookshelves and gates to apocrypha along with repositioning a few vanilla things which were clipping through the environment, there are a lot of issues with apocrypha which have mostly been hidden with the very dark vanilla textures, dark vertex coloring and generally dark environment, i tried fixing some of it for anyone playing with bright ENB's.

  
* There is a leftover variant of the gate nif with openable doors for anyone interested, fyi due to the shape of the door, the opening animation isn't perfect, it clips a bit.

* [Book Covers Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/901) (Any version of BCS should work as long as the book covers texture paths have not been changed but you must have one installed or else you will have purple 3d books on the towers, if you have LOTD you don't need a version of BCS since it comes with it.)
