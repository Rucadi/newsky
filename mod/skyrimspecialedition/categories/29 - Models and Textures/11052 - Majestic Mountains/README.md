Update notes:
  
  
[font=Tahoma][size=3]If you have version 4.01 already installed then you only need to download and install the 4.02 patch in the update section.[/font]
  
  
  
Introduction:
  
[font=Tahoma]
  
The goal of this mod is a complete mountain rework. The lighting of the mountains was changed in a way to fit much better to dynamic day night cycles and the weather system of Skyrim.
  
There are several differences to other mountain retextures.
  
One of the biggest difference is the mountain texture itself. Vanilla Skyrim uses two 4k textures for mountains. But one of this textures was barely used.
  
While looking into this texture data I've decided to merge the two textures into a big one. I've adjusted the uvw data and created a fitting lod.
  
And I abused the multilayer parallax shader to get a lot of variations on a mountain.
  
This causes a very natural geologic look. I wanted to prevent the look of stacked stones as much as possible.
  
The second big difference is the moss. I've created an optional esp that assigns a projected moss material to the mountains.
  
This prevents the look of texture tiling very effectively.
  
The mod also offers a texture pack for everyone who doesn't find fitting landscape textures.
  
And finally I've managed to get really good transitions from snow covered meshes to snow covered landscape by removing the vertex colors.
  
I've created three different versions: default, Darkside and Lightside.
  
These versions should be able to cover up many different lighting, weather or texture setups. There is a big variation of installed mods in the community and I try to be as compatible as possible.[/font]
  
  
  
  
  
  
[size=5]Installation:[/size]
  
  
Please read the readme before contacting me. I've tried to include the most common problems and the fixes in it.
  
[/size][/font][/size][font=Tahoma]DynDoLod is requiered for this mod to work properly.[/font][font=Tahoma]
  
[/font][font=Tahoma]I tried to cover all other important parts of installation, troubleshooting and compatibility in the readme.
  
You'll find it in the documents section of the mod page and I put it in the installer too.

Compatibility:
  
[font=Tahoma][size=3]
  
[/font][/size][/font]

  
* [font=Tahoma]this mod isn't compatible with other mountain retextures, except retextures that were made for MM[/font]
[font=Tahoma]this mod is compatible with all major snow mods[/font]
  
* [font=Tahoma]"HD Lods" is using my mountain lod textures. You shouldn't overwrite it during the installation[/font]
[font=Tahoma]I created my own fx meshes now and removed some of the redirections within the esp files. If you get asked for overwriting meshes within water mods you should do it.[/font]
  
* [font=Tahoma]There are two meshes conflicting with ELFX. I suggest using the EFLX files.[/font]
[font=Tahoma]Majestic Mountains is using meshes with more polygons than SMIM. It is highly recommended that you overwrite the SMIM meshes. [/font]
  
* [font=Tahoma]You can use Enb mesh fixes with Majestic Mountains. If you are asked to overwrite then choose yes. I added several compatibility fallbacks in the esp and the textures.[/font]

Known Issues:
  
[/font]
  

  
* the moss and the projected snow sometimes tend to create stripes. This is an engine limitation of the projection system. I could work around this issue pretty good. But there is no way to fix it completely.

These are the important extensions and fixes that I found so far. I try to update the list as often as possible.
  
I currently didn't post any snow fix mods. Because they are not needed if you follow the instructions of the readme.
