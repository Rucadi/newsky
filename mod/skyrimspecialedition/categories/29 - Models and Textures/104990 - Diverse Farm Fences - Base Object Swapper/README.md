Hi everyone!
  
  
Skyrim has a lot of farms and a lot of fences around those farms. Surely, there isn't just one crafts-person who's making and maintaining all those fences? If not, why are they all exactly the same? This mod aims to address that by adding four different variations of the wooden fence to Skyrim.
  
  
It uses : [skyfall515](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/41181730)'s awesome [Witcher Style Fences](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93163)
  
             : [ICFur](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/61366196)'s [SMIM Woven Farm Fence](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85450)
  
             : [Kiddgimmick](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/6309911)'s [KG's Fences](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/79126)             : The version two fences from [SD's Farmhouse Fences SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38912). Huge thanks to [SDlutz](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/74882563)!
  
             : and your choice, but I recommend using [SD's Farmhouse Fences SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38912) version one.
  
  
A huge thank you to the mod authors for giving permission to use their work. Please be sure to give them some kudos!
  
  
So, how does the mod work and what's all this about 'your choice'? Using the magic that is [powerofthree](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/2148728)'s [Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805), this mod distributes four varieties of farmhouse fence to the different farmhouses around Skyrim. The 'your choice' simply refers to whatever you have installed as your choice of replacer/vanilla before this mod is installed. So, whatever you've been using for fencewoven01.nif and fencewoven02.nif won't be replaced by this mod. I recommend SD's farmhouse fences (as they're fantastic) but it's entirely up to you. 
  
  
Skyfall515's Witcher Style Fences are distributed to Falkreath and the surrounding area. 
  
ICFur's fences can be found around Riften and Rorikstead.
  
KG's fences are distributed to farms around Solitude and the surrounding area.
  
SDlutz fences are distributed around Hollyfrost, Brandy-Mug and Hlaalu farms, and around Dawnstar.
  
Your current fence will be distributed to farms around Whiterun and through Riverwood.
  
  
Future plans:
  
  
Create more variants. If I can get more permissions, I'll add more fence variations too.
  
  
Thanks for checking out the mod and, as always, happy adventuring!
