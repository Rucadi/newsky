This is an adaptation of the female Lioness Mod textures to fit male Khajiit
  
  
\*NEW\*
  
The head normalmaps have been changed. I uploaded the original SC head normalmaps (what's seen in the images) if you prefer those instead.
  
  
Redid the head sculpt because I had messed up the previous one and finally was able to fix it!
  
The new preset requires [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71876) and [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42635) for hair and I recommend [Fia's Eyes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68912) for the bigger pupil size
  
\*Fixed the sculpt into JUST a sculpt because the preset was not working properly. Import with racemenu. If there is a neck gap just add a mask to the whole head EXCEPT the neck then hit Z to undo the sculpt. Should fix it!
  
  
Patches:
  
- AWG Tweaks - HUGE shoutout to [Sassiest Assassin](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/SassiestAssassin/mods) for helping me with the feet and hand issues! I added their version using [Terre's](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Terreflare/about-me?gameId=1704) normalmaps as an optional file! Give them Kudos!
  
- Nipples - Yea it sounds silly but I was playing around with textures and thinks it looks more natural with this small added detail. Nipples courtesy of MONSTERaider 
  
- Pink nose optional file (highly recommended) - without it the original texture has some funkiness around the nose
  
- Lion Paws - adds paw pads to your hands (NEWER VERSION INCLUDED IN MAIN FILES)
  
- Khajiit Paws/Grey Pads - for those who use the mod [Khajiit Paws](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43511?tab=description). This is far from perfect. The normalmaps do not match at all so keep the jewelry part on to help cover the mismatch a little better
  
-SOS patch
  
- TRX SOS patch
  
- SAM patch - Needs to be tested
  
- Khajiit Overhaul digitgrade\plantigrade patch
  
- HIMBO SOS Better Male Patch - For any of these mods. Also Install if having issues with regular feet. Should fix it
  
- Lion Hoodies - Texture patch for Bad Dog's Hoodies. Haven't tested it so let me know if it works!
  
- Stripes - Optional stripes version! Just a recolor of Muscular Khajiit - Stripes file
  
  
  
Things to Note:
  
- The head texture used is the actual texture from the [Lioness mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48041) and so are the paw pads addon!
  
- The body texture is a modified version of [Muscular Khajiit](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/900?tab=description) textures light version.
  
- Face Normal maps from [Terre's 4K Fur textures for CoverKhajiit](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76568)
  
- This mod works for Khajiit Overhaul too.
  
- The images without the pink nose were made before I made further edits to the lion head sculpt. Those are using my [original lion head](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71292) sculpt from my previous mod.
