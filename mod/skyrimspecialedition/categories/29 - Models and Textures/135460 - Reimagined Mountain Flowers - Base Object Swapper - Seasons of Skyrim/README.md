This mod replaces blue, purple, red and yellow mountain flowers with blue lupine, periwinkle, poppy and dandelion. All the geometry of the flowers is close to reality, as I made an effort to carefully replicate their appearance.
  
  
[/font][font=Georgia]The plant textures are available in 2048 and 1024 resolutions, and the plants also use subsurface scattering maps with a 512 resolution. The meshes geometry is well-optimized, so the mod should not affect performance at all.
  
  
[/font][font=Georgia]The flowers have a snowy variant; they are placed in the snowy regions of Skyrim. The mod also supports Seasons of Skyrim.[/font]

* [size=3][font=Georgia]﻿[/font][font=Georgia]Incompatible with other mods that also replace mountain flowers.[/font]

* My mod does not edit ingredient records, so it should be compatible with any mods for alchemy overhauls and other changes.

* [font=Georgia]Just install the mod in the Data directory or use any mod manager.[/font]
[font=Georgia]You might need to adjust subsurface scattering in the ENB you're using. Open the ENB menu (Shift + Enter), and in the enbseries.ini file, find the [VEGETATION] section. Change the values of the SubSurfaceScattering parameters to whatever looks best to you - I recommend starting with a value of 0.50. Make sure the IgnoreWeatherSystem option is checked in the [VEGETATION] section, otherwise you’ll have to tweak these values separately for each weather type.
