# FYX - Fortified Whiterun Consistency

I love "[Fortified Whiterun](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40094)" of skyfall515, I can't start a game without this mod.
  
  
There's just one thing that bothers me every time I go to Whiterun, the Riften Towers
  
- So I combined Riften's towers with Whiterun's architecture and textures for better consistency.
  
- Replacement of wall, roofs and windows of the first fortified gate with versions more consistent with the architecture of Whiterun.
  
- Replaces Stockade walls with Whiterun style walls
  
  
I've seen other things that lack consistency, I'll add them in a future update.
  
  
  
> ~~If you are also using [Bells of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10495) with [Fortified Whiterun patches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40094?tab=files#:~:text=Bells%20of%20Skyrim,making%20the%20patch!), place this FYX before the Bells of Skyrim patch in your load order. Otherwise you will have a flying tower near Jorrvask~~
