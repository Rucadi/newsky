Take the paddlin' outta battlin'!

[size=5][[color=greenyellow]->](https://mods.bethesda.net/#en/workshop/skyrim/mod-detail/3029834) For XBox One[/size][/color] <-

  
A simple reshaping of the vanilla weapon meshes so that they're not so big/bulky/ugly(IMO).
  

* [size=3]The meshes have been painstakingly reshaped and fixed, NOT simply thinned/flattened uniformly.[/size]
The meshes WILL WORK WITH *ANY* re-textures (yes blood too), look at their **shape** in the images, **not** the textures!
  
* Don't take the old joke images too seriously, I made them ages ago never expecting this mod's popularity. ¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯

  
[size=5]INSTALLING[/size][left]This mod consists of REPLACEMENT MESHES ONLY: there are no [size=3]vanilla textures.[/size][/left][left]**There is no .esp file**, [size=3]so you will not find it in your load order or plugin list.[/size][/left][left]*Install* order IS important, you must overwrite other mod's files to get the new shapes.[/left][left]Use the installer - requires a mod manager - pretty much everything is optional.[/left][left]100% SAFE: installing/uninstalling or changing options mid-game will have NO effect on your savegame.[/left]
  
[size=5]OPTIONS in installer:
  
[/size]

  
* EVERYTHING! [size=3]Don't like the new scimitar? Don't select it in the istaller.[/size]

* Left sheath meshes for **dual-sheath mods** - r[size=3]equires a mod like [Ecotone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17763)﻿  - **overwrite its meshes**.[/size]
**Sheaths**: select if you want sheaths for anything that doesn't have one in vanilla, including greatswords.
  
* **aMidianBorn Skyforge** weapons: requires [aMB Skyforge mod](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/34147) [size=3] - **overwrite its meshes**.[/size]
**Runed Nord Hero Weapons**: requires [RNHW mod](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2525) [size=3][size=3] - **overwrite its meshes**.[/size][/size]
  
* **FrankFamily's Ultra HD Silver Sword**: requires [UHSS mod](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29563) [size=3][size=3] - **overwrite its meshes**.[/size][/size]
﻿**FrankFamily's HD Imperial Weapons**: requires [FHDIAaW](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20848)﻿ [size=3]- **overwrite its meshes**.[/size]
  
* Dawnbreaker: choice of either vanilla, Elven or Dwarven sheath versions, + ENB particle patch versions.
Dragon*Bling* weapons: your choice of a ruby, emerald or sapphire gem in the pommel, or vanilla gem-less.
  
* New scimitar model, choice of plainer or fancy with gem.
Glass/Stalhrim/Keening **Refraction** looks better than vanilla, or can be used for transparent weapons which requires [size=3]skysan4298's mods ([glass](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4899)﻿/[stalhrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4028)﻿) - overwrite his meshes.  Note: Skyrim's engine causes parts of the refraction to disappear when held up before particle effects like smoke. [/size]Parts of the blood may also disappear based on viewing angle with the transparent option.

[/color][/size][/color]

* **DragonBling Gemling All Standalone**: requires [Gemling Queen Jewelry](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4294)﻿'s textures. Adds [size=4]ruby, sapphire and emerald Dragonbone versions to the crafting menus[size=3][size=2] [size=3](doesn't touch the vanilla weapons, so you'll have 4 different types of[/size][/size][/size][/size][size=4][size=3][size=2][size=3] Dragonbone weapons in-game). Main file still required to change the vanilla weapon shapes).[/size][/size][/size][/size]
[size=2][size=3]**Dawnbreaker Greatsword**: added to bottom of Forrelhost dungeon, doesn't replace one-hander. Uses vanilla Dawnbreaker enchant.[/size][/size]
  
* **SkyRealism - Shiny patch**: [size=3]requires [/size][SR-S](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/48526/)[size=3] [size=3][size=3] - **overwrite its meshes**.[/size][/size] Makes armour and weapons reflective like polished metal, but not compatible with other retextures like aMidianBorn. Note: some of his textures are missing mipmaps, causing a slight lag when[/size] viewing, this causes some loadscreens like the nord in full plate or the guy in full dwarven gear to appear partially invisible.
**Daedric Reaper patch**: [size=3][size=3][size=3]requires [Daedric Reaper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4372)﻿ - overwrite its meshes.[/size][/size][/size]
  
* [size=3][size=3][size=3]**Runed Nordic Weapons patch**: requires [Runed Nordic Weapons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11559)﻿, a standalone glowing set -﻿ [/size][/size][/size][size=3][size=3][size=3][color=#fff2cc][size=3][size=3][size=3][size=3]overwrite its meshes.[/size][/size][/size][/size][/size][/size][/size][/color]

  
COMPATIBILITY
  
Compatible with everything except other MESH-replacing mods.
  

  
* ﻿[size=3]Compatible means "no conflicts", it does NOT mean that this mod will auto-reshape modded weapons![/size]
﻿If a re-texture mod includes meshes, then the new textures will usually still be used, unless the author changed the texture filenames/paths, then a patch is needed.
  
* ﻿Replacer mods that change weapons with completely new, uniquely-shaped meshes *require no patch*; just install that mod after this one to use their meshes.
Fully compatible (and reshape will work) with﻿ mods that change any weapon stats, enchants, etc using a plugin (.esp).
  
* Fully compatible with mods that add new weapons (like Immersive Weapons), even if the new weapons are variants of vanilla weapons. If those mods use for ex. a vanilla sword to make a spear, that sword-spear will NOT look like my sword unless they used my mesh as a base. I will not make patches for such weapons, ask sword-spear guy.

[/color]

  
* ﻿[size=3][color=#ffff00][size=4]you credit me (a link to this mod in your Desc is nice but I'll settle for mention in the credits),[/size][/color][/size]
[color=#fff2cc]you're not simply re-packing all or a good part of this mod (no modpacks unless the pack is a link list),[/color]
