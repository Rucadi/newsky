Vigilant DeadPile Flesh re-texture

  
New textures available in 1k / 2k and 4k for the meshes used in the cursed world and piper locations in VIGILANT.
  
The eyeballs use the same textures i had made for habd's remains so if you are using my unique skulls mod don't worry about overwriting prompts they're exactly the same.
