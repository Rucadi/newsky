[font=Verdana]I noticed this glass jar was never updated to a better model, so I did it myself.
  
  
Just a simple replacer, new model, new textures, makes the best use of ENB Complex Material and refraction fixes, it also features ENB particle light when needed.
  
  
You can use the glass jar models as a resource for your mods.[/font]

**Installation**
  
  
[font=Arial][font=Verdana]It has a FOMOD, so I recommend you install it with a mod manager.
