**Installation:**
  
Simply install the chosen variant. Both PBR and CM versions come prepatched, they should work as is. They are only meshes and textures, no plugins, safe to remove midgame. EDIT: The CM version actually requires dynamic1pxcubemap\_black.dds that comes with PG output and various CM mods. I might add optional fully vanilla meshes later.

**Technical details:**
  
Made from meshes bought from Dekogon Studios. I did a lot of editing to reduce the poly count by multiple times, for example the largest hay mound went from the original "lowpoly" 16k triangles to around 4k. All meshes use 1 or 2 trishapes and only one texture set, which could make it perform better than vanilla even with more tris. The one texture set is combined from two in the original meshes using different transparency levels. I changed the hay bale mesh to not appear machine processed, and all parts are scaled up somewhat but the hay is still thinner than in vanilla. I spent a lot of time moving the transparent pieces around to make it not feel too scruffy with the lower tris and to avoid floating and cut-off parts.
