# Particle Lights for ENB - Nordic Ruins Candles
- Author: RemmyKun
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52335
This mod contains SMIM meshes and textures.
  
[size=5]**These candles already had a slight glow... but I feel that it was too slight. So, I made this for those who want more intensity heheh**
  
Check the images for comparisons (using Silent Horizons ENB with Lensflares disabled) :D
  
  
  
  
**INSTALLATION:**
  
1) Install manually or using any mod manager.
  
2) Be sure that you have this settings in enbseries.ini file:
  
[EFFECT]
  
EnableComplexParticleLights=true
  
  
[COMPLEXPARTICLELIGHTS]
  
EnableBigRange=true
  
  
  
**REQUIREMENTS:**
  
-An ENB preset to enable the particle lights effect.
  
-I included the bones and candles' textures from SMIM; so... this mod is standalone and does NOT require SMIM.
  
  
  
**COMPATIBILITY:**
  
-NOT compatible with mods that alter the same meshes. Those would require a patch.
  
-If you use SMIM, load this mod after it and overwrite the files.
  
-Compatible with [ELFX](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2424). Just overwrite the 8 conflicting meshes with this mod.
  
-Compatible with [Lux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43158) (patch provided under optional downloads).
