This mod gives HD textures to both the bees and honeycomb. To the bees, it also employs the use of [shell texturing](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/89195/)﻿ to make it more fuzzy. As a bee should be. It *should.*
  
  
The shell texturing is used on both the bees in the jar and the bees as an ingredient. The bees in the wild use a different mesh, so they aren't as fuzzy, but they all use the HD textures.
  
  
No esp's. The textures are 1024x1024.
