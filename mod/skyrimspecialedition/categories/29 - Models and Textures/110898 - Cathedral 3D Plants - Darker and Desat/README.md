Darker and Desaturated textures for most available Cathedral 3D Plants. Originally created with VR in mind, 
  
  
but suitable for SE too, if the plants appear too bright or saturated in your game. 
  
  
Made this for my own game, but i thought some of you might want to have it as well.
  
  
It only includes the diffuse textures, so it will require the original mods.
  
  
  
What´s included
  
  
- Clover
  
- Deathbell (i turned the brown leaves to green)
  
- Lavender
  
- Mountain Flower 
  
- Nightshade
  
- Snow Berries (Green and Variegated version)
  
- Stonecrop
  
- Sword Fern
  
- Thistle
  
- Tundra Cotton
  
- Tundra Shrubs
  
  
It also includes the snowy versions of Snowberries and Mountainflowers which i had created for the original mods 
  
  
  
The Dragons Tongue is not inlcuded, because i made my own texture replacer for this plant.
