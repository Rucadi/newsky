**Description**
  

  
* Skyrim uses camera-attached particle effects for fog in many places.
However, this effect can be overwhelming in certain places or with certain ENB configurations, making it difficult to see.
  
* Some example of locations with overwhelming camera-attached fog effect:
    
  [list]
[Yngol Barrow](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Yngol_Barrow)
  
* [Nchuand-Zel](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Nchuand-Zel)

[\*]This mod reduces the transparency of camera-attached fog particle effects by 2/3.
  
[\*]I kept 1/3 of the effect to retain some of the original intended atmosphere of the dungeons.
  
[\*]How annoying the original issue is and how much effect this mod has depends on your enb configuration.
  
[\*]The following nifs are edited by this mod:
  

* /meshes/effects/fxcameraattachblowingfog.nif
/meshes/effects/fxcameraattachfog.nif
  
* /meshes/effects/fxcameraattachgroundfog.nif
/meshes/effects/fxcameraattachturbulentfog.nif
  
* /meshes/effects/fxcameraattachwispyfog.nif

[\*]This mod only edits camera-attached particle effects for fog. For other types of fog, please search for other mods.
  
[\*]This is just a port of my Oldrim mod [No More Blinding Fog](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/61680)﻿ that I made in 2015
  

* I have been using this a few years, but I was too lazy and/or forgot to port it
