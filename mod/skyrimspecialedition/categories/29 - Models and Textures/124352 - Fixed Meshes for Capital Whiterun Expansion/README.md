[Capital Whiterun Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37982)﻿ by Surjamte is a very creative and expansive mod!

It does, however, have several issues with it's custom meshes...bad or missing collision, bad UVs, missing faces, misaligned parts, etc.
  
  
I fixed as many of these issues that I could find.  I may add a few more meshes and/or tweaks, but here they are for now.
  
  
Enjoy!

Mod Features:
  
I included an esl-flagged plugin that just disables a few collision boxes that are no longer needed since the meshes have collision.  Definitely not required, but nice if u want to hear sounds upon mesh impact.  Just delete it if you don't want it.[/font][font=Times New Roman]
