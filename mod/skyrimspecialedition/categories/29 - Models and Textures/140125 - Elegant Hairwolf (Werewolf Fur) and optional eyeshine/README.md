Adds some shell fur to the wonderful mod, [Elegant Werewolf Replacer by Wolflady500.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93336) Provided as is with Timber Dark+Terror as the only color/model option; if you want to make your own shell retextures or other edits, be my guest!
  
  
I also included a version with "[Eyeshine](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyeshine)" aka looks like they are glowing, but only if there is a light source to reflect.
  
  
  
Check out [Pelage - Werebeasts by SkySinclaire](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/163265?) if you want a similar effect on vanilla werewolves and or werebears﻿.
