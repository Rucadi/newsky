**Description**
  
  
PBR (Physically Based Rendering) is an approach for materials and rendering that creates more accurate and predictable results than vanilla rendering techniques, and works very well with dynamic lighting conditions (like time-of-day).
  
  
This addon will ensures that materials like metal, wood, and fabric behave consistently under different lighting conditions. Improving the textures with reflectiveness, roughness, metallic shade, and parallax. I've also applied fuzz for fabric and furs so they have proper colored specular.
