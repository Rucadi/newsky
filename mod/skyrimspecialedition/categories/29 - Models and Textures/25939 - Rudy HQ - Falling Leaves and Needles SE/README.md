**This is some kind of a everlasting WIP project. At least until I get bored by this game ;)**

**Straight from the Heart Quality overhaul of in-game falling (and windy) leaves and needles effects. Comes in two variants, for an ENB users and for a Vanilla game.
  
HQ textures and tweaked particles.
  
Decreased glowing for the Vanilla version.
  
If you use ENB, the brightness of the leaves can be controlled in the [PARTICLE] section**
  
  
  
**How it looks in action, you can see here:**

The leaves texture is 1K (4K png files are available in miscellaneous section).
  
  
  
  
**Performance impact - unknown. The particles in the game are semi-transparent and have no depth, so if you use a DoF effect from ENB, they can be blurred, sometimes.**
  
  
**See the images section for a more details :)**
  
  
  
  
**Installation:**
  
  
Install it with a Mod Manager. Overwrite the meshes from Particle Patch.
  
  
Like all particle effects in the game, this one also depends on the parameter in SkyrimPrefs.ini:
  
  
[Particles]
  
iMaxDesired =
  
  
set it to some reasonable value - 6000 or 7500.
  
  
  
  
**For the best visuals use ENB.**
