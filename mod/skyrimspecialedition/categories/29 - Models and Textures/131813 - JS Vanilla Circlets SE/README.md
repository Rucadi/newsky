**FAQ:**
  
  
1) Will this conflict with some other mod?
  
• As it is a new model, it is incompatible with any other mod that edits vanilla circlet meshes or textures. It is also incompatible with any mod that edits vanilla circlet records. This is because additional records were added to fix Orc & Elven clipping. If using USSEP, let this mod win any conflicts.
  
  
**Tell me about any patches that need to be made. I'm not a mind reader!**
  
2) What about Circlet of the Whatever from some other authors mod?
  
• Let me know about it and I'll possibly try to add it as a patch
  
  
3) What about JS Armored Circlets?
  
• It has no connection to this mod. It will be getting a graphical overhaul though in the near future.
  
  
4) I've got an idea for other variations!
  
• Post it and let me know, I'll see what I can do!
  
  
5) What are you using for your NPC's?
  
• High Poly Head, Reverie, Beards, Brows, Eyes Nouveax and Tempered Skins
