Having issues with bright UNIMMERSIVE trails and dust from dart traps? This should fix that by 1. removing the 'projectile trails' themselves (similar to weapon and arrow trails) and 2. reducing the glow of the dust trails reducing emissive multipliers and adding darker dust trails. Hopefully I got it all, but as usual I don't know what I'm doing when fiddling with these things in Nifskope. The issue seems most pronounced with ENBs.
