How are they made?
  
The smoke textures are made using Blender and then rendered in order to create a very realistic smoke texture.
  
  
Why is this mod (Beta)?
  
Well simply because I am going to be a full version of this mod with 16x different textures and 3 levels of turbulence meaning 48x image textures. However, this is going to take a while show I thought I would share with you this mod until then.
