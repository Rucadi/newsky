Added a patch for [Better Atronach Forge Offering Box](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/132887) by WSkeever, this patch includes textures from my troll skull mod and will use whatever daedric textures you have for the gauntlet sigil holder. See screenshots. If using this version then there are no other mod requirements.
  
  
Install order for the WSkeever patch : 1. Install either 4k Atronach Forge or the optional 2K Atronach Forge.
  
                                                                 2. Install WSkeevers mod.
  
                                                                 3. Install the patch in optional files for WSkeevers mod overwriting anything when asked.
  
  
New 4K ( or 2K ) texture for the atronach forge with changes made to the mesh for appearance purposes. I never really liked the skull and horns and seeing there is a dwemer cabinet as the offering box, i thought i would remove them and replace them with some dwemer items, particurlarly as JSkyrim has made excellent replacers for dwemer clutter. I also altered the texture path of the stone edging to use the ratway wall matching the surroundings. Was a simple thing to do but i never actually have had anything alter this myself so that's why i did this.
