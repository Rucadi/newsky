These are double-sided meshes updated in tandem with [Majestic Mountains](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11052) (MM) and [Majestic Mountains Complex Material](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/87547) (MMCM), since MM ships with single-sided meshes, and not all MMCM meshes are double sided. This is for use with mods that make use of the double-sided flag to either block light (e.g., [EVLaS](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63725)) or to render something different on either side of the mesh. Theoretically, double-sided meshes cost more in terms of performance, but this difference is insignificant on most modern PCs with respect to this mod.
  
  
There is noting special about this mod. It is the currently-available MM meshes with the double-sided flag set where applicable. Simply install it ≥ one priority or higher than MM and allow other mods to override this mod --if they enhance MM further and have double-sided meshes.
  
  
**Example Mod Installation Priority** (NOT plugin priority)
  
  
The following assumes all mods provide meshes as loose files. BSAs load in order of plugin priority and will never 'win' in SSE against loose-file counterparts.
