The next ["Cathedral Asset Remake"](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/images/201463) or CAR release I'm working on is planters, vases, and baskets. Like usual, it's expanded from just Cathedral Plants to additional assets like baskets and barrels of food, so here's another model optimization. A big credit for this goes to [iimlenny](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/171799673), who originally converted [MinFeng's 4k Tomato](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/tomato-d228b1557fb047329a9ff4e97a2d2121) to [Skyrim SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99094). They don't have open permissions on their mod, so I re-converted MinFeng's model myself and did some additional optimization on it. I'm not sure about the ettiquette of uploading another version of a model already converted by someone else, but... *optimization (TM)*.
  
  
This tomato isn't actually all that high poly at all. It has about double the faces of vanilla, but is not even half the size of [Static Mesh Improvement Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/659). If you want a good looking tomato with virtually no performance impact, this is the tomato for you!
  
  
NOTE: Unlike my other NTH models, this model isn't based on the vanilla one, and therefore isn't compatible with vanilla retextures.

A question/potential future update:
  
Should I add the little stem and leaves from the SMIM model to MinFeng's model? I like the look, but the original is much closer to vanilla. But SMIM is so widely used that maybe it would blend better on people's setups, once CAR is released?
