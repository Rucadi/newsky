**Useful Elder Scrolls HD - SE**

  
  
**Modified version of [maximluppov's](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3457257) Useful Elder Scrolls to make it use my model and textures with the same animations etc.****I'm uploading this on it's own mod page to make sure to respect the Original mod author's permissions, please go endorse the [original mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/40117) if you like it :D
  
  
(I've patched the meshes and edited the plugin to remove the unnecessary texture sets since i have the color variations for the blood and sun elder scrolls setup differently which makes those records redundant.
  
There are 2 additional multi-parallax textures for the blood and sun scroll gems.)
  
  
[Elder Scroll HD - SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51082) is required, install it first then this mod and let this mod overwrite anything it asks.**
  
Model and texture replacer for the elder scroll.
  
Textures are available in 4K/2K and 1K.
  
The model has animated spinning parts, with a slightly different animation for when Serana or someone else is carrying an elder scroll.
  
[size=4]The gems use multi-layer parallax and have a pulsating glow effect along with an animated FX.

**=>original mod description:**
  
  
Never thought why such a powerful ancient relic is so useless on practice? I mean it's a game series named "Elders Scrolls", but not a single game from the series gives you the opportunity to actually use those mysterious artifacts. Even Serana wears one, but for some reason you can't. But not with this mod!
  
Give some practical use to your Elder Scrolls. Wear them! Enjoy their new cool look and beneficial magical bonuses.
  
Wear one by yourself, give other two to your followers! Get bored from them? Sell them!
  
  
Changes to the vanilla scrolls (book items):
  
1. Weight is set to 5 instead of 20.
  
2. No longer a "quest items", thus they actually have weight.
  
3. Price is set to 6000 for each scroll.
  
4. Texture was enhanced and made 3 different gems colors for each of the 3 scrolls.
  
5. After you'll use your scrolls in crafting wearable versions they will no longer be a quest items even if this mod will be uninstalled. This is a side effect, but I see nothing harmful in this.
  
  
Q: How to use this?
  
A: Go to the tanning rack and attach a strap to your scroll. All you need is a leather straps and an Elder Scroll or course. If you are using [Frostfall](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/11163) then you can do that in any place you like with a help of portable tanning rack.
  
  
Q: Great! I've used my Elder Scroll to craft wearable one and now I can't proceed by quest. Thanks a lot, pal!
  
A: Not a problem I say! Go to the tanning rack and cut off the strap. Get your quest item back. Attack strap back, if you wish, after your quest is done.
  
  
Q: After my death and reload of last savegame my scroll is floating in the air or just not appear on me. What should I do?
  
A: Just re-equip it or reload your savegame clearly (exit to the main menu 1st). This is in-game glitch. I can do nothing about that.
  
  
Q: I can't attach a strap to my scroll. It's complaining about the luck of components. What should I do?
  
A: Report to me with the name of the scroll (Dragon, Blood or Sun). And note if you donated the scroll to Urag gro-Shub during your gameplay.
  
  
Q: This is mod is so cool! I like it!
  
A: Endorse it then! ;)
  
  
Q: This is BS! Not going to use this!
  
A: Well... do not use it then.
