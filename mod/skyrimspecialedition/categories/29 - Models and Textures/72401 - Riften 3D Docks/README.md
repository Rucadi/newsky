Not much to say. The goal of this mod is to change the current, horrible [size=3]low poly Riften's Dock meshes into higher poly actually round meshes.[/size]

All textures are compatible as long as they use vanilla paths (that means every mod that is on nexus at the moment probably). If you are wondering about the difference between this mod and [Skyrim 3D Docks and Boardwalks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28781) then you will be pleased to know our mods actually have different goals. I still recommend continuing to use his mod for Solitude meshes as they are really beautiful (if you like this mod just make it overwrites Skyrim 3D Docks). I've used that mod that myself for years. I made this because that mod forces people to use just that texture or ones specifically for that mod as it does not play well with darker textures whereas this allows you to use vanilla or your favorite dock textures to create consistency throughout your game.

The mod only includes meshes, so install it however you prefer (mod manager or manually).
