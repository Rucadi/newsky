Replaces the god-awful vanilla gleamblossom plantwith something more higher poly, and closer to the ingredient model. 
  
  
Comes in two versions, one with vanilla glow, and the other with ENB lights. Compatible with texture replacers, such as Forgotten Plants Retextured.
  
  
Vanilla gleamblossom is about 5.5k polys, this version is about 9k. There may be a performance hit on lower end machines, but it's unlikely since you don't encounter them very often in large numbers.
  
  
This also replaces the 3D Trees and Plants mod's gleamblossom (which swaps it for a totally different and non-animated model), if you have that installed.
