**[size=5]Xelzaz' Telvanni Spellsword Armor 2K Retexture

[/size]
  
  
What this mod does:**
  
Changes Xelzaz' armor and hood textures with an AI-upscaled and more detailed version. The original files were only 1k with the hood being 512x512 px in resolution. My edits are all 2K. I left the normal maps mostly unchanged for now.
  
  
The changes are rather subtle since I just made this for personal use, but I like them, and the author of Xelzaz - BluePwnsU - gave me permission to upload.
  
  
Newest update improves and fixes all the compression artifacts and miscolorings. See comparison picture.Since this is just textures, you can safely enable and disable this mod at any point.**Requirements:**You obviously need [Xelzaz](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62893) for this to work.You ***don't*** need the original armor that Xelzaz uses - [Telvanni Spellsword Armor by Alexmancer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15830) - but if you really want to, you can override their textures with mine so you can use them on the spellsword armor.**![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1090366182458130533/1095400992872349848/telvannicomparison.png)
