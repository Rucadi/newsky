**FAQ:**
  
  
1) Why does the lexicon use the vanilla model?
  
• The splitting animation is too annoying to put that much time into remaking, plus it's all tied to behaviors so it's easy to mess up without direct nifskope feedback.
  
  
2) The Lexicon texture is re-used in some other models, like the Aetherium Shards, why not use it?
  
• This texture was made specifically for the lexicons to fake rounded edges and while it does work on items like the Aetherial Shards, in areas it is wrong would need to be tailored specifically.
