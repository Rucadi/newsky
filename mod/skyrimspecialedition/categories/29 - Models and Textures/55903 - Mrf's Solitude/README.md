= Introduction =
  
I just went into this retexture with this idea of making solitude more like the capital.
  
Also allows for architectural diversity.
  
 So in many places I replaced the unique decals.
  
 I used clockwork meshes to replace the blue palace and college interiors to make these two areas extremely luxurious.
  
 Although the exterior is still a bit shabby, the interior is not.
  
Why college, because the college is most artistic and close to the blue palace and I think the architecture looks good.
  
Just modified part of the internal model, external model textures modified part.
  
So it matches with other external overhauls.
  
  
  
= Mod order =
  
  
Load Mrf's Solitude Exteriors after the following mods:
  
  
Particle Patch for ENB
  
Unofficial Material Fix
  
SMIM - Static Mesh Improvement Mod
  
Assorted Mesh Fixes - Parallax 
  
  
  
The Unique Interior replaces meshes with the help of Base Object Swapper.
  
Therefore load order shouldn't matter.
  
  
= Feedback suggestions =
  
  
Some of the postings I don't think are done properly, you can point them out and I will update them.
  
Please give me a post if there are any problems so I can update it.
  
I have a lot of time to learn at the moment so I don't have that much time to test.
  
So this solitude retexture I did off and on for a month.
