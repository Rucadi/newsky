An on going process to improve the models of the game with more polygons , UV edits or just replace them all together. SMIM was the inspiration and the lack of similar mods led me to make this.

The reason i ask people to overwrite the above mods it's because i keep the best qualities of each mod and combine them with mien aka "best of both worlds" Example: I improved the wall baskets shape and smim improves the hanging feathers of them, so i kept my mesh with the new uvs and transfered smim's new feathers to mien. All of the "conflicting" meshes are like that, keeping the shader properties of ELFX while keeping my mesh. I just wanted to clear that up cause i saw some misunderstandings regarding the reasons i ask people to overwrite them and it certainly isn't because i think my meshes are "superior".

Reupload, fixed polygon holes in some of the latest objects special thanks to Drigger for finding them. Candle mesh temporary disabled until i figure out what's wrong with it.
  
  
v2.0
  
New static mushroom meshes that can be found in farmhouses , ruins , dungeons and more, the ones that can be harvested are not done yet because they are a bit more complicated but they will be done in the next version.
  
  
v1.9
  
Reupload, fixed wrong file path for the dragon head mount in Whiterun castle.
  
  
v1.8
  
New meshes for all dragon bones found as ingredients and clutter throughout the world, that also includes the mounted dragon head in Whiterun castle above the throne. I am not sure if that includes the dragon skeleton that appears after you kill a dragon.
  
New meshes for the rings found on nordic posts, see pictures.
  
  
v1.5
  
Fixed wrong file path for Meridia's statue.
  
New meshes for burned corpses, not all of them done because they needed more work then i was expecting. Because these meshes repeat quite a bit the polygons are not too excessive.
  
  
v1.0
  
The candle mesh is WIP and doesn't replace all candle meshes yet. Also the candle mesh is the only object in this pack that doesn't use excessive polygons. Only a few points and UV edits.
  
  
  
**- FAQ -**
  
  
- What is the performance hit?
  
Minimal\None reported yet, decent cpu is more important here.
  
  
- Your meshes are terrible!
  
They are better than vanilla and that's all i wanted.
  
  
- Why is the polygon count so high?
  
Because the engine can take it, and it's also the easiest way to make the objects smooth and or realistic.
  
  
- Oldrim updated version please?
  
I don't mod things i don't play, join us in SSE.
  
  
- Can i give you suggestions?
  
Always! Suggestions and constructive feedback is always welcome and needed.
