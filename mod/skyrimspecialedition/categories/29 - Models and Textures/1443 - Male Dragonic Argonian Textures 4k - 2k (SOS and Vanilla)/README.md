[font=Courier New]Notes about the mod[/font]
  
SOS Regular and Vanilla (additional infomation below in the compatibility issues section)
  
Seams has been mostly fixed (Feet aren't 100% seamless)
  
Comes with custom specular maps, should be a very subtle shine (remove them if you don't want any shine at all)
  
4k body/head/hands and 2k body and 1k head/hands choices for resolution
  
   
I always saw how Argonians didn't really have much of a choice when it
  
comes to varied textures. So I decided to make my own and well, this was
  
the result. By no means am I a professional texture artist. I'm pretty
  
much some dude that has a lot of spare time, aside from work.

* [size=4]Schlongs of Skyrim REGULAR: Should work fine[/size]
[size=4]Vanilla: Should work fine aside from possible seam issues on the feet (also vanilla feet meshes are pretty much ugly)[/size]
  
* **[size=4]Vanilla bodies with Better feet:** Using SOS textures should be ok but I'm unsure. Haven't tested it yet.[/size]
[size=4]**Better Males:** Penis UV maps aren't fully textured but textures should show up decently[/size]
  
* **SOS Lite:** UV maps will not show up properly for schlong (textures were made with SOS Full version in mind).
[size=4]**Shape Atlas for Men (SAM):** Penis UV maps aren't fully textured but it should show up on the body correctly.[/size]

[font=Courier New]FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions)[/font]
  
   
Q. Are you making a vanilla version?
  
   
A. ~~No.~~Yes   
   
   
Q. Are you going to texture Better Males penises?
  
   
A. No. Technically I have one textured already but I didn't get too far with it. There's only one UV map in the diffuse map that I "sorta textured" but it wasn't very much. I believe it was one of the uncut meshes. (which is probably still in the diffuse map.)
  
   
   
   
Q. I have a seam when I'm naked, at the base of the penis. Will you fix it.
  
   
A. I would but I've had a lot of issues trying to import SOS's penis mesh into Blender (which is what I use to fix seams), so I eventually gave up on fixing it and tried the best of my ability to make it look decent.
  
   
   
   
Q. Is there a female version?
  
   
A. Yes there is. http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1442?
