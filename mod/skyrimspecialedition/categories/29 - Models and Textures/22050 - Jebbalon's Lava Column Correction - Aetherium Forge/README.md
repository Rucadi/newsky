Lava Column Corrected 
  
  
The SSE version for some reason did not convert this mesh from LE to SSE very well.
  
  
Now with my fiddling it looks much better!
  
  
I used the Lava Column mesh in [my Room mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7712) and noticed right away that it didn't look at all like I remembered it from the Skyrim Legendary Edition. In [nifSkope](http://www.niftools.org/) the mesh looks correct and I could not figure out why in game it looked so odd. I researched the meshes and [nifSkope](http://www.niftools.org/) and [NifOptimizer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4089) (didn't help for this) asked around a bit but couldn't find solution - so I started fiddling.
  
  
I cannot tell you the exact steps taken to improve this mesh. I literally just fiddled with settings till I found what worked. Images above show one setting that did change the mesh in nifskope to look like what I was seeing in game. The Enable Testing checkbox above the Alpha Test Function. I think I ended up changing the values there to get the look.
  
  
If you look closely at the image from [UESP page for the Aetherium Forge](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Aetherium_Forge)﻿ you can see that it looks correct in LE skyrim that image is from 2012-13. Image from my room mod looks a bit different because I am using a lower portion of the column than what is visible at the Aetherium Forge, it's more the middle of the column.
  
  
There are two layers to the mesh. The inner has somewhat darker colors and the outside is supposed to have the transparent 'holes' in order to see the inner layer. The Alpha on that outer layer I think is what needed the changes.
  
  
MODDERS - Please feel free to include this mesh with your mods that make use of the Lava column.
  
  
Any questions or if someone has better solution let me know in comments.
