SpoilerHaving a dense IRL schedule and lack of will for now, I'll try to keep up but at a slower pace. Stay tuned and patient; if I said that I'll get to it, I hopefully will. Sorry if I had anyone waiting.
  
  
?**COMPATIBILITY**
  
  
❌[Diverse Werewolf Collection SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7009) (DWC)
  
❌Any werewolf or werebear remodel unless a patch is provided here.
  
❌Any mod that specifically changes an NPC's werewolf or werebear model via a plugin would prevent this mod to function on that NPC.
  
✅Overhauls covering mechanics and gameplay.
  
✅This will not turn your whatever Aela replacer into invisible. The one seen in the GIF is from [Serket](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98602).
  
✅Mods acknowledged to be compatible or made inbuilt so: (⛔Beware, may contain spoilers):Spoiler[Wicked Werewolves](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31757);
  
[Tales of Skyrim - Berserkyr](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/103559); feral werebear keeps its mesh added by that mod.
  
[Werewolf Spirits](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78734);
  
[The Beast Within](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/91239);
  
[Werewolves Among Us](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/104380);
  
[Madmen - A Forsworn Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98579);
  
[Forsworn Skinchangers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34900);
  
[Authentic Sinding](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33517); Sinding's werewolf keeps its mesh added by that mod.
  
[Caranthir Tower Reborn SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4269); encountered werewolf keeps its mesh added by that mod.
  
[Wyrmstooth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45565); world encounters.
  
[Beyond Skyrim - Bruma SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10917); world encounters.
  
[Racial Skin Variance - SPID](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81668); I know, you wouldn't expect that. But that mod assigns a new skin record for werebears, which would interfere with the random NPC distribution if I haven't taken precautions.
  
[Extended Encounters](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44810);
  
[Immersive World Encounters](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18330);
  
[JS Emissive Eyes SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60108); as a user reported.
