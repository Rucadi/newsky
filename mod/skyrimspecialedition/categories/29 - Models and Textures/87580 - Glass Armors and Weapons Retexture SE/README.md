This mod retextures the Glass armor set, shield and weapons, Chillrend, CC Glass Crossbow and CC Glass staff. Also contains optional retextures Amidianborn's content addon's  Thalmor glass armor and Vvanderfell Glass armor and for Oblivion artifacts Pack's quicksilver boots, LOTD's Glass bow of the stag pince and Grimsever (blade only), Wyrmstooth - Craftable Brimstone armor and weapons and Elsopa's glass quiver. 
  
  
This mod also overwrites the glass armor meshes to fix the mismatched cubemaps and shader setting between pieces. These mismatched cubemaps and settings make it almost impossible to match all armor pieces together. Trying to reduce this issue by tweaking your textures is only a patch on this issue, which is why update 2.0 finally makes all armor pieces and weapons use the same cubemap (gold\_ore\_e.dds for the gold version, Shinybright\_e.dds for the thalmor and vvardenfell versions) and the same environment multiplier. 
  
  
The textures for the Glass sets are based on [Cabal120's aMidianBorn Book of Silence](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35382)﻿. I used their normal maps as a base to create my retexture. 
  
  
I have tried to patch as many popular mods as I can. If I missed anything, please let me know in the comments or feel free to create the patch yourself and publish it on nexus (will provide instructions on how to create these mesh patches lower on this page. it is very simple to do).

If using [Amidianborn content addon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35390) or [amidianborn armor variants lite](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45160), will use the gold textures on the glass armor and retexture the thalmor glass and vvardenfell glass armors and shields added by those mods
  
  
**CATHEDRAL ARMORY**
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/3NhQLfT.png)
  
  
Textures only, requires [Cathedral armory](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20199)'s meshes. I personally do not recommend this version as the weapons do not match (cathedral armory doesn't cover them)
  
  
  
  
**AMIDIANBORN CONTENT ADDON CUBEMAP CHANGE ESP-FE**
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/vuJUOhM.png)
  
  
The latest update of amidianborn content addon changed the cubemap used on the vvardenfell and thalmor glass armors. While this change looks good on their original textures, I personally preferred the old shinybright cubemap when used with my textures. This option uses an esl-flagged esp to revert the texture sets' cubemaps to the old shinybright\_e cubemap texture. since it only changes texture sets, it should not cause any incompatibilities with other patches. (both before and after use my retextures. without this espfe, the vvardenfell set looks darker and the thalmor set looks more purple).
  
  
The LITE version of the addon does not need this.

The lastest version of [amidianborn content addon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35390) added thalmor glass and vvardenfell glass weapons. This option will apply my gold textures to the glass weapons and my thalmor and vvardenfell textures to their respective weapons.

**ARMOR MESH PATCHES**Because I modify the armor meshes to make them match (in vanilla, some pieces use the gold cubemap, some use the shinybright cubemap and some the opal cubemap). These mismatched cubemaps make it extremely hard to have a coherent look between all pieces. I tried to cover as many mods as possible, please let me know if I missed anything or feel free to create your own patches and publish them.
  
If using bodyslides, select the correct patches, load my mod after your bodyslides and regen them.

**WEAPONS MESH PATCHES**
  
  
The gold version of the weapons don't need much patching. I simply fixed the ground meshes for the battleaxe and mace having a different cubemap than the versions you hold. The Thalmor Glass and Vvardenfell glass versions need more patching as I needed to change their cubemaps to make them match the armors.

These are optional retextures for some of my favorite mods. All the original mods are required and while I took inspiration from the originals, none of these textures used any parts of the original textures found in these mods.

**MESH PATCHING TUTORIAL**
  
  
Here is an explanation on the mesh changes I did. Please feel free to use these instructions to create your own patches, if I missed any.
  
  
**GOLD ARMOR MESHES**For gold armor meshes, you simply need to change the cubemap to textures\cubemaps\Ore\_Gold\_e.dds and set both Environment Map Scale and Specular Strength to 1.0
  

**VVARDENFELL AND THALMOR GLASS ARMOR MESHES**

Set the cubemap to textures\cubemaps\shinybright\_e.dds and set both Environment Map Scale and Specular Strength to 1.0 (same as gold)
  
  
**GOLD WEAPONS**the vanilla settings are fine. simply make sure the cubemap is textures\cubemaps\Ore\_Gold\_e.dds and the environment scale is at 0.55
  
  

**VVARDENFELL AND THALMOR GLASS WEAPONS**Set the cubemaps to textures\cubemaps\shinybright\_e.dds and the specular color of the metal parts to #79a06c
