Includes highly detailed meshes and corresponding textures to replace all Skyrim's small and medium size rocks and rock piles.
  
  
All the replacer models are carefully optimized for gaming.
  
  
This mod uses 3 textures , 4096 x 4096 px each and their normal maps also in 2048 x 2048 px resolution.
  
  
The .esp plugin is mandatory for the regional texture sets of the rockpile ground covers to work properly.
  
  
  
Hope you enjoy.
  
  
SPECIFICS
  
- The meshes replaced by this mod would be rockM01 - 04 , rockpileM01 - 03 , rockS01 - 03 , rockpileS01 - 04 and their wet versions.
  
- The rock meshes have new matching collisions.
  
- The rock pile meshes use the original bethesda's collision boxes. You may notice some offset when walking over those.
  
- All the meshes are sculpted (to the point of that being possible) to be of similar sizes as the vanilla ones. There wont be any clipping anywhere.

FAQ
  
**- Will this mod come with an FPS penalty?**
  
Probably not. The meshes are carefully optimized (polycount varies between 400 and 2500 vertices) and only 3 textures are used for the whole pack. On top of that, one texture set by bethesda to cover the ground mesh of the medium rockpiles (rocks01.dds) will not be used at all.
  
  
**- Why the large rocks and rockpiles are left out?**
  
Getting old.
  
  
**- Can i have different textures/normal maps?**
  
No. These models are materialized from real rocks and their textures and normal maps are baked from their high poly.
  
  
**- Will this be of a match with my mountain textures?**
  
Depends. An oldrim style rocks/mountain texture set like Noble Skyrim's will not match. A better one, like Majestic Mountains, will match perfectly fine.
