This is a continuation of my previous similar mod, *Embers HD*, and really a love letter to all who have used and enjoyed Embers HD along the years. This mod started as an improved version of *Embers HD* but after some initial prototyping it remained in a limbo for a long time due to the other commitments and lack of motivation. However, we recently passed 10,000 endorsements for *Embers HD* and I felt like it's my turn to give something back to you. So here it is finally, the envisioned next version of *Embers HD*, and I hope you will enjoy it.
  
  
I'm uploading this one as a separate mod because it's pretty different to *Embers HD* especially in regards to aesthetics, and keeping this thing separate makes it much more to manage both mods but also for you to switch between each. In other words, *Embers XD* is a replacement of *Embers HD* and it needs to be uninstalled prior to installing this. Not compatible with any other mods that modify fire sources either, I'm afraid.
  
  
A Lite version with half a resolution (mostly 2K) textures is provided for those who want to save bandwidth or system resources (VRAM).
  
  
For even more conservative VRAM usage 1K version is provided, as well.
  
  
No scripts used so safe to install, safe to uninstall.
  
  
As always, ENBSeries is highly recommended.
  
  
[Diverse Campfires - Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/109731) by [FrankBlack](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/146320) is a perfect companion mod to go with Embers XD. It's an immersive mod that adds over thirty variants of the campfires you find around Skyrim, all by leveraging the magic of Base Object Swapper for hassle free integration into your load order.

**Installation Notes**
  
  
This mod uses particles for the flame effects as well as particle lights so please ensure the following parameter is set as follows in SkyrimPrefs.ini:
  
  

```
[Particles]
  
iMaxDesired=10000
```

  
All flame effects of Embers XD should be continuous, and a telltale sign of running out of particles is flame particles disappearing intermittently or completely for fire sources. If increasing iMaxDesired doesn't help (that may happen if you're using other particle heavy mods) you can try to use the optimized installation option since it will reduce the amount of particles with some loss of visual quality. Embers HD, Inferno and vanilla style flames also need less particles.
  
  
Complex Particle Lights offered by the recent versions of ENBSeries are fully supported by Embers XD.
  
  
I recommend enabling

```
EnableBigRange
```

(in enbseries.ini) as follows:
  
  

```
[COMPLEXPARTICLELIGHTS]
  
EnableBigRange=true
```

  
  
**Frequently Asked Questions**
  
  
**How to make the flames more or less intense and adjust flame color?**
  
  
Increasing the

```
intensity
```

related parameters in the

```
[FIRE]
```

category of enbseries.ini will make the flames more intense, while reducing them will have an opposite effect. The

```
curve
```

parameters work like gamma control. Increasing the curve tends to make the flames more red and concentrated, while decreasing will make the flames more yellow. Be aware that increasing the curve also easily results in the flames blowing out especially with high amount of bloom. For reference, here's how mine are set at the moment:
  
  

```
[FIRE]
  
IgnoreWeatherSystem=true
  
IntensityDawn=1.0
  
IntensitySunrise=1.0
  
IntensityDay=1.0
  
IntensitySunset=1.0
  
IntensityDusk=1.0
  
IntensityNight=1.0
  
IntensityInteriorDay=1.5
  
IntensityInteriorNight=1.5
  
CurveDawn=1.0
  
CurveSunrise=1.0
  
CurveDay=1.0
  
CurveSunset=1.0
  
CurveDusk=1.0
  
CurveNight=1.0
  
CurveInteriorDay=1.0
  
CurveInteriorNight=1.0
```

  
  
**Embers look overly bright or dull. How to adjust the intensity of the glow?**
  
  
Adjust the intensity and curve parameters in the

```
[WINDOWLIGHT]
```

category. Like with flames, increasing the

```
intensity
```

related parameters will make the embers brighter, while reducing them will have an opposite effect. Increasing and decreasing the

```
curve
```

parameters will give the glow more or less a red tint. For reference, here's how mine are set at the moment:
  
  

```
[WINDOWLIGHT]
  
IgnoreWeatherSystem=true
  
IntensityDawn=4.0
  
IntensitySunrise=4.0
  
IntensityDay=4.0
  
IntensitySunset=4.0
  
IntensityDusk=4.0
  
IntensityNight=4.0
  
IntensityInteriorDay=2.0
  
IntensityInteriorNight=2.0
  
CurveDawn=1.0
  
CurveSunrise=1.0
  
CurveDay=1.0
  
CurveSunset=1.0
  
CurveDusk=1.0
  
CurveNight=1.0
  
CurveInteriorDay=1.0
  
CurveInteriorNight=1.0
```

  
  
**How to increase or decrease the intensity of the light cast by the fire sources?**
  
  
Increase or decrease

```
intensity
```

parameters in the

```
[COMPLEXPARTICLELIGHTS]
```

category.
  
  
**How do I reduce the glow from the braziers?**
  
  
Decrease

```
intensity
```

parameters in the

```
[LIGHTSPRITE]
```

category.
  
  
The installer also has customization options for reducing the glow intensity or disabling it completely.
  
  
**How should I set

```
[COMPLEXPARTICLELIGHT]
```

parameters?**
  
  
There's not right or wrong but for reference, here's how mine are set now:
  
  

```
[COMPLEXPARTICLELIGHTS]
  
IgnoreWeatherSystem=true
  
EnableBigRange=true
  
EnableShadow=true
  
ShadowQuality=0
  
IntensityDawn=1.0
  
IntensitySunrise=1.0
  
IntensityDay=1.0
  
IntensitySunset=1.0
  
IntensityDusk=1.0
  
IntensityNight=1.0
  
IntensityInteriorDay=2.0
  
IntensityInteriorNight=2.0
  
CurveDawn=1.0
  
CurveSunrise=1.0
  
CurveDay=1.0
  
CurveSunset=1.0
  
CurveDusk=1.0
  
CurveNight=1.0
  
CurveInteriorDay=1.4
  
CurveInteriorNight=1.4
```

  
  
Increasing the particle light curve will give the light a more red shade which can often seem more realistic for a wood fire.
  
  
**How can I improve performance?**
  
  
First, try reducing

```
ShadowQuality
```

(or even set

```
EnableShadow
```

to false) and set

```
EnableNormalMappingShadows
```

to false under

```
[COMPLEXPARTICLELIGHT]
```

. The latter in particular is not something you will notice unless you start pixel peeping and it can hit framerate significantly especially when looking at fires up close.

```
EnableBigRange
```

is another setting that will impact framerate but setting it to false it will cause particle lights after some distance being culled which does not look nice as it will result in the particle lights popping in the view. If nothing else helps you can try the "Optimized" customization option available in the installer but note that it will also reduce the quality of the effects somewhat.
