**\*NEW\***Alternate toned down version, for those that don't want their Morthal swamps looking like a bush rave. This version has very dim ENB lights (optional file for no ENB lights is available) new leaves and more natural colors. Still glow mapped, but no funky design on this one. 3 colors only in this version.

﻿Higher poly fungal pods, still not the best shape possible but they're supposed to be gross anyway. Glow maps, optional ENB lights, 8 different variations distributed with a 12.5% random chance using po3's [Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805)﻿. Thank you as always to [VanNuys22](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/49788111)﻿ for showing me tricks I never knew and scouring the internet for free PNG's of leaves with me. **If you feel the ENB lights are too bright, you can grab the optional file that removes the ENB glow and keeps the glow maps. The results are much more subtle but still funky.**

Should be compatible with everything as long as the fungal pods aren't being swapped by another BOS mod, or the EditorID of FloraSwampFungalPod01 isn't being changed by another mod. [Complete Alchemy and Cooking Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19924)﻿ patch available, it's for the ingredient since it has to be replaced through the ESP (which is ESL flagged) and makes the ingredient stats match CACO if you have it. Load after anything changing fungal pods so that the ingredient displays properly in inventory. 
  
I am using [PRT XII](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4743)﻿ with the [Next-Gen Photorealistic Graphics](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74949)﻿ preset, along with NAT Weather and [ELFX](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2424)﻿. This could look drastically different in your lighting set up.
