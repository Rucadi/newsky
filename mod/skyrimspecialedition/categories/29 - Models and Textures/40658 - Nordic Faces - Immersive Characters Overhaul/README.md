# Nordic Faces - Immersive Characters Overhaul
- Author: The Community and deletepch
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

Inspired by [Cathedral Player and NPC Overhaul - HMB II](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24174), I want to make a character overhaul that preserve the vanilla aesthetic with modern textures and models. Thanks to many talented modders in the community, there are lots of high quality and open-sourced assets exist. I hand-picked and choose the best available one to achieve a realistic, eye-pleasing and consistent visual to enhance my Skyrim experience.
  
**Nordic Faces** can be used as a complete package of character overhaul, or serve as a solid base which you can add your favorite skins or NPC mod on top of it. The mod contains ***no plugins***, only textures, meshes and FaceGen files are included to ensure high compatibility with other NPC mods.
  
  
  
**Features**
  

  
* High quality and lore-friendly textures for Faces, Body, Hairs, Beards, Brows, Eye, Scars, Warpaints and Makeup.
Better hands, feet and body models. No neck-seam or clippings with vanilla clothes and armors. 
  
* Improve all playable races including human, mer and beastfolk. As well as vampire, snow elf, children and old people.
Tweaked some NPC appearance to look more eye-pleasing and less ridiculous. 
  
* Realistic, vanilla-flavored and consistent visual and aesthetic.
**Plugin-less** installation and high compatibility with other mods that edit NPC records. **No black face problem**.
