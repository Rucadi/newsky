Vanilla Amulet **textures** 4x Ai Upscale (and some manual after edit to the results), diffuse and normal map textures.
  
  
Original 256 x 256 px, this mod 1024 x 1024 px textures.
  
Might sound low, only 1k, but Amulets are small objects, even the originals were only 256px. Also the normal maps are 4x now too, which will give more detailed "depth" too.
  
  
  
Added Enviromental Mask textures (\_m.dds) that were missing (Cubemaps and Dynamic cubemaps use these if assigned to models) from vanilla game.
  
Enviromental Mask textures won't have any effect unless the models are made to use them (vanilla for some reason only uses these for couple of amulets by default). So it depends what models you have installed in-game, if they will use these or not.
  
  
They are based on vanilla diffuse texture.
  
  
*There is optional download with only the Enviromental mask textures.*
  
  
Couple amulets already had 1k textures, so I did not include those. For example dlc1 vampire amulet.
  
  
Not much else to say, should keep vanilla aesthetic intact.
