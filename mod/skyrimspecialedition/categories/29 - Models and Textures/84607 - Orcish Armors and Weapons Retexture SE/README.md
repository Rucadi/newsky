This mod retextures the Orcish armor, shields, weapons, CC Orcish Plate, CC Orcish Scaled armor CC Orcish bolts, CC Orcish Crossbow and CC Headman's axe. This mod also includes optional consistency retextures for  [NordwarUA's Race Armor Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34585)'s orcish armors , [Oblivion Artifacts'](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10644)helm of ferocity and Also includes a patch for [Cathedral Armory](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20199)﻿
  
  
  
This mod also includes optional cubemap addons for the orcish armors. In vanilla, all orcish weapons use cubemap reflections, but none of the armors do (including the CC ones). These options overwrite the armor meshes to apply the same cubemap as the weapons, making them match better.
  
  
Fomod lets you pick and choose what you want. 
  
  
Textures are 2k except Chest armor textures, which are 4k.
  
  
Half-res version available in Optional files (2k chests, shields and weapons, 1k everything else)
  
Low-res version is also available in optional files (1k chest, shields and weapons, 512 everything else)
  
  
  
**﻿FOMOD OPTIONS**
  
  
  
**Choose what to install**
  
  
Choose which textures to install and if you want to install textures-only or my Cubemap addon versions. Cubemaps are used to create metallic-looking reflections. Most metallic armors and weapons in Skyrim use them. While orcish weapons use cubemaps, Orcish armors do not. The cubemap addons will overwrite all your meshes. The fomod will provide meshes for popular bodyslides and mods. Please see "patch tutorial" further down this mod page, to learn how to create your own patches for these cubemap addons. It is quite simple and quick to do.

Cubemap Addon**

The cubemap addon is highly recommended. It will make the iron armor look shinier and more metallic. It is a lot more noticeable in movement

If you install any of the bodyslide patches, it is very important that you re-generate your bodyslide outputs.

**CONSISTENCY PATCHES**
  
  
Consistency patches are optional retextures of modded armors, clothes and/or weapons I like. The goal of these is to make these items match my retextures. I do not ever claim that my versions are objectively better, all authors who's work I cover are extremely talented people! The original mods are always a hard requirement.
