Too high poly? Like the original vanilla shape? Good news for you! [Kiddgimmick](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/6309911)﻿ has created a low poly mesh replacer, available [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81784)﻿ :)

High Poly Dark Elf Lanterns, diversified with BOS. Original mesh from [Dark Elf Lantern ENB Light - Animated Glow](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63176)﻿ by [wSkeever](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/7064860), I made it high poly to be a nice circle as a quick thing for my friend, then got carried away with making it something bigger. Added 8 different textures to be swapped with a 12.5% chance randomly using [po3's](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/2148728)﻿ [Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805). Version compatible with [Nocturnal Moths](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68288)﻿ by [jple](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3360836) is available thanks to [VanNuys22](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/49788111)﻿.
  
  
If you do not like some of the lantern patterns I've made, you can open the **0DVDiverseDarkElfLanterns\_SWAP.ini** and edit the percentages for the lanterns you don't like to 0% so they never show up. Make sure your edits are consistent between all models if you don't wish to see that particular lantern again.

**~ Compatibility ~**
  
 Should be compatible with everything other than mods replacing the same thing. Compatible with Nocturnal Moths when using the version of this mod made to work with it (Thanks to VanNuys22). Compatible with mods like Dawn of Skyrim that add Dark Elf Lanterns. As long as the EditorID's of the lanterns are not changed, and there isn't another mod's SWAP.ini trying to change the lantern as well the swap will work.
