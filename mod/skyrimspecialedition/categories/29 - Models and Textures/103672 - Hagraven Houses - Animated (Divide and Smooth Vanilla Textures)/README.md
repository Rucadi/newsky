This is a supporting mod for [Hagraven Houses - Animated](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/101952) by [StoneSpiralGaming](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/95141903)
  
It allows the vanilla wood textures patch in [Subdivide and Smooth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77912) to carry over to the animated version
  
Original Mod is still required, load below both
  
  
**This is a pure mesh edit, no textures were modified**
