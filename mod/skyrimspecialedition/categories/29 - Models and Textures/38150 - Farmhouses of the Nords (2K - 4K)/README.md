Skyrim's Scandinavian influence can be seen throughout the game, and the aesthetic of the Nords are heavily inspired by viking's and many other Norse styles seen throughout ancient Scandinavia. So why is it that the many Farmhouses seen throughout the province of Skyrim appear closer to that of an English Medieval style? This mod offers a complete texture overhaul for all farmhouses throughout Skyrim, as well as an LOD atlas for those willing to regen their LODs. Gone are the Cyrodiilic looking villages, and old English farm towns. Now when you stroll through your nearest settlement, you'll be greeted with with dark cobbled stones, rough sickly planks, and worn dirty thatch rooftops, all inspired by real Nordic styles, fit for a province that is the homeland to Nords.

Naturally, this will be incompatible with anything else that retextures the same
  
things. Be sure to give this mod priority, or overwrite existing files
  
if you prefer its textures to something else in your load order that may
  
 conflict.
