**Disclaimer :**I do not recommend using mods such as BENDR as i've seen evidence of it creating "details" where there shouldn't be, as well as making the specular maps completely black in some cases.If you are using the textures provided by BENDR or something similar for this mod, do not expect things to look identical or better than what you see in the screenshots on the mod page.Any issues that arise from using bendr textures for this mod are on you, i will not be fixing anything related to it.Normal maps cranked to 11 with extra, random "details" and missing (black) specular does not equal improved.My mods have open permissions so other Mod Authors can create new, additional content, but things like this feel more like an insult than anything else...
