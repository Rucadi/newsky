Fot the Watchtower, I started from the same observation as for my previous FYX for the fake windows, I still found a lot of things to fix, then I extended the work to the ramparts who also needed help.
  
  
  
**File (A)** - Vanilla meshes with less bugs -
  
- Repairs a lot of holes (faces that were missing, reversed or misplaced)
  
- Open windows for the Watchtower
  
- Fix some UV
  
- Fix UV around all Windows
  
- Now natively compatible with [LUX Orbis](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56095) and other light mods
  
- Changed the floor at the bottom of the towers which was inconsistent with the place. It is replaced by wooden planks, also changes the sound of the Dirt => Wood collision to be coherent.
  
  
**File (B)** *If you already have mods that completely change this area, or you find the new addition useless, go to version **(A)***
  
- Fix same as **(A)** file, but with access to the side ramparts
  
- Add two patch for this file, for **NO eFPS users** and for **eFPS users**

> *- If you are using **eFPS**, it is advisable to use the patch for version **(A)** and **(B)** because it fixes an original bug through the ramparts tower window.
>   
> - Also useful if you don't use this FYX*

  
  
Enjoy !
