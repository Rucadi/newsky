CONSITENCY PATCHES
  
  
Consistency patches are optional retextures of modded armors, clothes and/or weapons I like. The goal of these is to make these items match my retextures. I do not ever claim that my versions are objectively better, all authors who's work I cover are extremely talented people! The original mods are always a hard requirement.
