# HFs - BS Bruma Food

I have answered many times in the past that I don't like and don't want to make food for Skyrim when users asked me to make new food models. It's true. I really don't like doing it.
  
However, I am currently working on my new mod for **"Beyond Skyrim - Bruma SE"** mod (it's not food related) and I have to test my models in-game (in Bruma) every day at different stages of the work. Because of this, I see this ugly food all the time and my eyes "bleed".
  
I really love "Beyond Skyrim - Bruma SE" mod, it's a wonderful mod and its team did a great job. However, "Beyond Skyrim - Bruma SE" mod is many years old and its models and textures are very outdated as of 2024. That's why I decided to change a few food elements that seemed the most ugly to me.
  
This mod contains only three of my new models **for "Beyond Skyrim - Bruma SE" mod**, namely: ***beefpasty.nif***, ***orange.nif*** and ***ricecooked.nif.***Only meshes and textures, no ESP. Safe to install/unistall at any time.
  
  
I hope you will like it. Endorsement is appreciated ?
