**[REQUIREMENTS]
  
[BOS](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805)** for the 'Full Rag Diversification'and the 'Hold' version of the mod.
  
[AnimObject Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/75167) if you want to use the corresponding 'ObjAnim Addon'.
  
  
**[DESCRIPTION]**
  
As you decide this is just a texture replacer for the folded rag or you get some more color/pattern variants due to the power of Base Object Swapper.
  
All textures are in 2k and I don't plan on making any bigger/smaller version of it - anybody is free to do this.
  
  
The optional file should work in conjunction with the main file, please report if something doesn't work.
  
  
  
**[COMPATIBILITY]**Should be compatible with everything else as long as it doesn't edit the Rag01.nif or it's corresponding textures.
  
  
  
**[ToDo]**Nothing for the time being.
