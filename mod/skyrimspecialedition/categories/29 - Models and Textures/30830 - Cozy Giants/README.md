**Overview:**
  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
Cozy Giants is a model replacer for the Giants you see roaming within the game, Giants are usually found half naked and don't tend to look like they care for the cold weather.
  
  
This mod changes that!
  
  
Giants will now wear a mashup of skaal and fur armor, this will give the impression that they too become cold due to the harsh climates of Skyrim!
  
Within the installer you will find 4 available options that you can choose from, these will replace the different variants of the Giants found around the world. You can mix and match them to your liking or if you would like to have them all I have added a Leveled List plugin.
  
  
  
**Requirements:**
  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
Naturally you will need to have the **Dragonborn DLC** installed due to the textures being used from the Skaal clothing, if you  decide to download the mod without Dragonborn installed you will find purple/missing textures on the Giants clothing.
  
  
  
**[b]Incompatibility/Mod Requests**:[/b]
  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
The mod will work with any texture mods that you have installed for fur, skaal and Giant meshes.
  
The mod will not work with any mesh replacers for the giants themselves. 
  
  
If you have an Incompatibility issue or Mod Request to share please **DO NOT** put these in the **"BUGS"** or **"POSTS"** tabs otherwise your comment/post will be deleted. If you would like to report an Incompatibility issue or request a Mod to be supported please post these in the **"FORUM"** tab under **"MOD SUPPORT/REQUESTS".**
  
  
If you decide to post an Incompatibility, could you please post constructively and analyse the issue. Please describe the issue with examples rather than a simple "this is incompatible with xx". This will help me define the issue and proceed to create a patch fast and efficiently.

  
  
**Installation Instructions:**---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  

**AUTOMATIC:****(Recommended)**
  
If you have a mod manager that supports FOMod scripted installers such as Vortex or Mod Organizer, download the Main File by using the "Download with Manager" button located under the Main file. Once downloaded you can begin installing the mod, you will be greeted with an installer containing options that you will select based on personal preference.
  
**MANUAL: (Not Recommended)**

Download the Main file using the "Download Manually" hyperlink located next to the "Download with Manager" button. Once downloaded open the file with an archive extractor such as 7zip or winrar, open up the "Giant" folder and extract the contents to the data folder where "SkyrimSE.exe" and "SkyrimSELauncher.exe" are located. Do the same with the "Giant1" and/or "Giant2" folders.
