Q&A﻿
  
What new ?
  
I remake the whole mod with 80% less polygone and made it more organic !
  
  
What do i do if i don't want the esp ?
  
Select the no esp option when you install the mod !﻿
  
  
Why not upload it on the old page ?
  
Because it's a rework, so made it from scratch﻿ !
  
  
The your meshes look more clean what happen ?[/color]
  
I learn retopology !
  
  
Does it requires ENB ?
  
Yes only for the particle light !''EnableComplexParticleLights" turned on in the Effects section (ENB UI) and "EnableBigRange"in the [COMPLEXPARTICLELIGHTS]
  
section.
  
  
What happen if i don't have ENB ?
  
You won't see particle light !﻿
  
  
Where do i find Chaurus King Staff ?
  
In Shimmermist Grotto you need to find and kill ''The Chaurus King'' to obtaine the staff !﻿
  
  
Are you sane ?
  
Yes i'm just bored and weird !
