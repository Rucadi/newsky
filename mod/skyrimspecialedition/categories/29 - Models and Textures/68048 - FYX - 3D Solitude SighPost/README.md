Reworked Solitude SighPost and BannerPost meshes.
  
These are meshes often used in many mods like JK's Skyrim, Fortified Whiterun... because they are practical meshes as a support base for constructions.
  
  
- Ropes in HightPoly version.
  
- 3D HighPoly chains and support
  
- 3D nails
  
- Adds Cubemap on the iron parts.
  
  
Use SMIM Textures, so you must have it for everything to display correctly.
  
  
Enjoy !
