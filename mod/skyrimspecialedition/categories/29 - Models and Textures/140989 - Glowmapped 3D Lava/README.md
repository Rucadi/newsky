- New lava texture - I think it looks nice, less yellow, more orange
  
- Removed the weird buggy ass bubbles - No more beach balls phasing in and out of existence
  
- Smoothed the lava model - The flow is now more subtle with less jagged edges
  
- Gave lava a glow map - Now it emits light nicely
  
- Gave lava a normal map - Now it appears to have a little depth
  
- Gave lava a refraction layer - Now it shimmers air around it making it look real hot
  
- Redid the lava waterfall thing - I think it now looks like it was intended?
  
- 4k texture spread to a larger area - Less pixelating with less tiling while still being an interesting looking texture
  
  
That's just about it fellas.
  
  
Random fact of the day:
  
In the Aetherium forge both sides of the lava pool have a gate you can technically swim to and get to safety. The gate then leads over to a series of small tunnels that take you up to the forge room, near the ceiling, where you can drop back down. I'm not sure why the devs added such tunnels since they shouldn't really be able to be accessed, but it explains why the forge room has weird gates near the ceiling you can't go in from.
