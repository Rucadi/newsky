# LOD Model Library for DynDOLOD

I made matching LOD models for a few mods that use altered vanilla assets or replace vanilla meshes with ones that use different textures. This is required in order for the LOD model to more closely resemble the full model and minimize visible transitions when the cell loads in. You can see examples of the differences in the gallery. All of the new lod models have been adapted from the free-to-use lod models provided in [DynDOLOD Resources SE 3](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52897) by sheson.
  
  
These are just meshes and will use your own textures. The screenshots in the gallery feature mainly Skyland textures.
  
  
**Requirements:**
  
A LOD generation with xLODGen or DynDOLOD is required, otherwise these won't do anything. These were developed and tested with [DynDOLOD 3 Alpha](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68518).
  
  
**Installation:**
  
The FOMOD installs most of the files automatically, and they are used in LODs if the relevant mods are detected during generation. This is similar to how DynDOLOD Resources provides multiple LOD files for different mods.
  
A new LOD generation is required for the new models to be applied.
