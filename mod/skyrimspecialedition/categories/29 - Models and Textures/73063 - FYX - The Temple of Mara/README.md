For a temple, I think the Vanilla mesh is too simple.
  
I wanted to add some details to embellish it, then I took the opportunity to fix some things.
  
  
- Fix Uv's
  
- Fix the Flying beam
  
- Fix some parts of the mesh
  
- Add details and ornaments to the entrance
  
- Add MultiLayer Parallax on the Jewel
  
- Add ENB Ligth Windows file (There is light inside, why can't we see it outside as there are windows?) 
  
- **10/2023** "**NO Ornament**" Version added !
  
  
Enjoy !
