Ok first thing first, You are only getting cleaned version for now. The reason is that it took forever to clean the textures is because of how big the textures were and how many I had to cleaned. Like some textures, I had to wait 20 minutes for it to finish cleaning 1 texture so times that by possible 60 4k textures I had to clean.
  
  
I might to a 2k version in the future but won't be for a long time and since the textures are pretty high in quality already there is no reason to rush in and make multiple enhanced textures of it.
  
  
This mod comes with a BSA version so you know what to do if you have been using my cleaned textures.
  
  
Major thanks again to Antistar for letting me upload this and having donation points enabled.
  
  
  
For over 6 months I have been cleaning textures of mods I use because of Kartoffel's information stating that cleaned and properly compressed Skyrim textures uses less memory loading it in, so it means more FPS in Skyrim which I need because this gaming pc is old and need new parts sometime.
  
  
Did over 20 mods and growing though most of them are personal use so had the greatest thought of asking the mod authors who created the mods if I can upload the cleaned textures from their mods here for those who want more detail and more FPS. Ironically got permission from quite a bit of modders so expect lot of Cleaned textures from me!
  
  
  
My way is slightly different from Kartoffel's cleaning and upscaling way. They use models/files to make the textures higher in quality which changes the original texture slightly. What I do is clean and upscale the texture with the normal upscale model so it retains the original texture but is slightly smoother yet a tad bit higher quality.
  
  
Love Kartoffel's work but me using tons of different models and choosing from thousands of different textures to use it on is a bit too much for me.
  
  
Because I do it this way I can do the texturing process faster.
  
  
To use this mod of course you need [Clockwork (SSE)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4155)﻿
  
Ps this goes great with Ancient Dwemer metal but make sure to get the SSE Dwemer Patch that covers the  rest of Dwemer stuff and the patch that covers some Clockwork Textures  here  [Ancient Dwemer Metal - patches for SMIM Dawnguard Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38845)﻿ 
  
Not required but is one of the most used mods to cover Dwemer metals.
