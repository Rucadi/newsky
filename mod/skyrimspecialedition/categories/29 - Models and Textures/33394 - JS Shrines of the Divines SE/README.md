**FAQ:**
  
  
1) What ENB do you use?
  
• A modified version of Aeon ENB. No, it's not being released! It's too messy!
  
  
2) Why are your normal maps uncompressed?
  
• This is for the best possible quality. It also gives the user the option to compress them if they wish and saves me from having to upload multiple versions.
  
  
2) Hurr durr can you save in this format plz?
  
• No!
