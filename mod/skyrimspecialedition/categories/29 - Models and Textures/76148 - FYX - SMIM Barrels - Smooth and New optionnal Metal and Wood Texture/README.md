> ***First of all, if you already have mods that improve the barrels, this little FYX will not help you.

> So if you have it, no need to download it unless you want to try it.
>   
> It's safe to install and uninstall anyway.***

  
Every time I pass these barrels, I get OCD, I find the angles too sharp, and each time I say to myself "One day you will be FYXED!"
  
It was time. :')
  
  
- Smooth the SMIM Barrel01.nif and ropes of Barrel02.nif
  
- Fix the UV's so that the top lines up with the body of the barrel01
  
- Add Environment Mapping
  
- Add new optionnal textures
  
  
Enjoy !
  
  
The barrel01 is animated.
