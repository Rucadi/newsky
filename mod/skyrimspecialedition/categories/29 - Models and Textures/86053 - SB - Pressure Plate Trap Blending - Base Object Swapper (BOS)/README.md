[font=Trebuchet MS]**Slightly Better Series - Pressure Plate Trap**Fixing vanilla annoyances - one at a time[/font]

  
  
  
  
[font=Times New Roman]Features
  
[/font]By default pressure traps in Skyrim use standalone texture from textures/traps folder. Because of that, many popular retextures often miss it and end result is hideous low-res blob in a middle of your perfect texture setup.
  
  
Well, no more. See screens for comparisions.
  
  
[font=Times New Roman]Compatibility
  
[/font]Compatible with every retexture, might look weird with some of them tho. Will conflict with anything that touches those meshes, but not in any critical way:
  

  
* meshes\traps\pressureplate\trapstonepressureplate01.nif
meshes\traps\pressureplate\trapstonepressureplate02.nif
  

  
But I have yet to find a mod, that touches them.
