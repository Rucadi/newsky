# Seamless Cubemaps
- Author: Moizoos
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

Overview
  
My main goal is to reduce seams that are caused by AI upscaling cubemaps, which you can see in the comparison images. Additionally, I smoothed out the textures and tried to remove any artifacts then compressed them in BC7 and created mipmaps.
  
  
  
Installation
  
Install these textures like you would any other mod. This mod is intended to be used as a base or resource. I recommend overwriting it with any custom textures like the ones from [Alternate Cubemaps](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65336) and/or [Custom Cubemaps (and Metal Tutorial)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58817).
  
  
  
Feedback
  
If there are any vanilla cubemaps I have missed please let me know, and I will add them to the mod.
  
If you have any suggestion to improve this mod please let me know, and I will take it into consideration.
