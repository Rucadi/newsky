I love [Quaint Raven Rock](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20851)﻿ and all its added features. One of them consists of adding the statues of the Reclamations in front of Raven Rock Temple. My mod tweaks a few things about that addition to make it a bit smoother, while using the new statue models by Mandragorasprouts. More details can be read below.
  
**FEATURES**

  
* The original mod sinks Boethah's whole shrine base into the ground to hide it. This also means it would use resources even if you don't see it.
In this mod, I made a copy of [Mandragorasprouts](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/40383990)'s [Boethiah statue](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59499?tab=description)﻿﻿, without the shrine base, to properly place her at the same height as Azura.
  
* Likewise with [Azura](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66776?tab=description)﻿, a copy was made to adjust her height properly, and to make the dynamic ash decals on her a bit more detailed.
Removed the rocks and scaffoldings next to Azura in favor of an actual [Mephala statue](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63585). A few clutters around were also removed to reflect the finished state of the construction.
  

  
**INSTALLATION** 

  
* Install all the requirements first.
Install this mod with your preferred mod manager﻿﻿﻿.
  

**KNOWN ISSUES**

  
* Boethiah's statue has no collision, and nothing will be done about it.
Azura's collision box isn't super accurate.
  

  
**COMPATBILITY**
  

  
* The Boethiah mesh I added is the same one found in my other mod [HERE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62833). The order shouldn't matter.
Due to the way I replaced Boethiah with a custom mesh, ***it is not directly compatible*** with any other replacers. You can still use your own replacer, but the statue found in front of the Temple won't use your model.
