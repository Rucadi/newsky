**High-poly glacier meshes with high-poly collision, HD textures, and high-poly seamless LOD, featuring dramatic, deep, refractive, colorful backlighting.**
  
  
First and foremost, huge thanks to **gravos8890 / gochargers2156** for **Skyrim Remastered Glaciers**, which was the starting point for this mod.

  
  
**OVERVIEW**
  
  
"Another glacier mod??" - Ah sh\*t, here we go again! I had a very specific look in mind that I wanted for my game, and after showing a few folks, they asked me to release it, so here we are!
  
  
There are a lot of great glacier mods out there so if you're happy with what you've got don't let me distract you. That said, I'm quite happy with how these turned out, and are exactly what I wanted in my game for over a decade.
  
  
I've always loved the [crystalline, translucent, deep blue, refractive glaciers](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/156970/156970-1755338523-1240196745.jpg) in nature, and wanted to bring that into my Skyrim.
  
  
Please have a look at the video showcase to see the glaciers up close, during different times-of-day, and a demonstration of the new LOD.

*(If a picture is worth a thousand words, is a 2 minute 60fps video worth 7.2 million??)*

**FEATURES**
  
  
This mod builds upon Skyrim Remastered Glaciers as a base, adding and expanding the following features:
  
  

  
* High poly glacier meshes with full shader settings overhaul
New high-poly collision for more accurate traversal & climbing mods
  
* A focus on dramatic backlighting that reacts strongly to sunlight, giving them refractive, translucent depth
Full set of HD textures and normal maps, including backlighting maps
  
* High poly glacier LOD meshes and seamless glacier LOD textures; You will have difficulty visualizing the difference! (see images / video)
LOD meshes can't have multi-layer parallax, so I made custom glacier LOD textures that mimic the effect, adding to the seamlessness between LOD/full.
  
* Built-in support for DLC glaciers
**Easy installation and setup.  Drop-in, run DynDOLOD, done.  No rules or additional work needed.**
  

  
**Please note that this mod focuses on glaciers and glacier chunks only! Frozen lakes, icicles, ice floes, animated icebergs, etc. are not part of this mod.**Also note that you may get different intensities based on your ENB preset and the weather; The stronger the sunlight, the stronger the backlight effect.
  
  
**INSTALLATION**
  
  
Install and go! While DynDOLOD is NOT required, it is highly recommended that you re-run DynDOLOD to regenerate LOD. No extra DynDOLOD setup or rules are required, just make sure that this mod overwrites \textures\LOD\glacierslablod.dds.
  
  
The plugin now includes fixes for the Dragonborn / Dawnguard glaciers.  If you're using a Better Dynamic Snow / Simplicity of Snow mod, let those overwrite this plugin.
  
  
If you'd like more white/clear glaciers, there is an optional file with desaturated textures.  Install the main file, and overwrite with the optional textures.
  
  
**Because this mod only focuses on glaciers, it's recommended to use your favorite ice mod along with this. Just let this take higher priority to get the glacier goodness.**
  
  
This mod has no requirements. ENB is not required, but the backlighting will be far more dramatic with it.
  
  
**COMPATIBILITY / REQUIREMENTS**
  
  
No requirements other than the base game.
  
  
As mentioned prior, this focuses on glaciers only, so it can be used with other mods like Icy Mesh Remaster, etc. Just give this mod priority to get the glaciers but keep the rest of the ice from the other mods.
  
  
This does not include any snow textures or materials, so whatever landscape textures you're using will work just fine.
  
  
Community Shaders disables the vanilla backlighting this mod leans heavily on, so you may not get the intended look when using CS. If that feature is introduced in CS I will likely make a patch.
  
  
**F.A.Q.**
  
  
**Q: Does this work with other ice and snow mods?**
  
**A:** This only covers glaciers, so yes, will still need a mod for icicles, frozen lakes, snow, etc. Simply let this override your other mods.
  
  
**Q: Why should I use this instead of other glacier mods?**
  
**A:** Honestly, if you're happy with your current glacier mod, just keep using it. Lots of great ones out there. I'm not selling anything here or looking to supplant other mods, just sharing my personal take on them!
  
  
**Q: What ENB / weather are you using?**
  
**A:** It's a WIP weather + ENB I'm working on ?
  
  
**Q: What snow mods do you recommend with this?**
  
**A:** I don't currently have any recommendations (my snow is all custom), but there are lots of great snow mods out there now. I do highly suggest Better Dynamic Snow or Simplicity of Snow to make the projected snow use your actual snow textures instead of looking like paint.
  
  
**Q: Did you know penguins have a gland above their eye that converts saltwater into freshwater?**
  
**A:** Acktshually, they have a specialized gland called the supraorbital gland located above their eyes that filters excess salt from their bloodstream.
