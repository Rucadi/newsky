# Cuyi's Campfire Backpacks

This mod replaces the fur backpacks added by Campfire with newly made custom meshes and textures (2K).
  
It also fixes the extremely inefficient collision of the original backpacks.
  
The new backpacks make use of cubemaps and require a plugin to enable them on the black and white variants. It's ESL-flagged so it won't count against the plugin limit though.
  
  
This should be compatible with mods like [Campfire HD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24511)﻿ - the backpacks use custom texture paths and won't conflict.
  
If you're also using [Campfire - Backpack's Patch for Medieval Torch and Axe](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44558) make sure my meshes overwrite them.
  
  
Also I'm aware that these aren't *technically* fur backpacks but i just wanted a clean looking replacer so most of the fur had to go. There's still a little trim left on the top though :)
