[size=6]Khajiit Has Tents**
  
  
This mod replaces the Khajiit caravan tents with proper Elsweyr tents like the ones found in Elder Scrolls Online. This will replace the large tent and the smaller tent found at all of the Khajiit caravan locations. The tents are also decorated, perfect for a traveling merchant.

**Install**:
  
Install with your mod manager of choice and put in the "City Overhauls" section of your load order. **Place after city overhauls and new locations. If the khajiit if falling through the floor, then your load order is wrong.**
  
  
**Install Order:**
  
Tree/Grass/Flora Mods
  
Grass Patch Mods
  
New Cities/Locations
  
City/Location Overhaul <--- Put "Khajiit Has Tents" here after other city overhaul mods
  
"Khajiit Has Tents" Patches
  
  
Only use patches from this mod page. Patches from others may either do more harm than good or are are not needed. If you have a proper load order, you won't have any issues.
  
  
  
**Installing The Patch:**
  
Install Immersive Citizens before city overhauls or new location mods and then KHT and then the KHT patch after all of those mods.
  
  
**Compatibility**:
  

  
* Not compatible with any other mods that replace the tents or add decorations and clutter around caravan camp sites.
This mod adjusts the navmesh, so place accordingly in your load order.
  
* This mod does not touch any npc. It swaps tents and updates navmesh to function with the larger raised tent and ramp.

  
**PERMS!**
  
So, if you want to use these tents in your mod, all you have to do is simply direct users of your mod to the "Resource" version of the mod on this page. So you can do whatever you want as long as Khajiit Has Tents - Resources is a hard requirement. Much like how overlay and eye mods are required for NPCs.
