# Higher Poly Vanilla Burnt Corpses
- Author: Pieter82
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

This high poly mesh replacer covers all 'burnt corpse' models as well as all 'bandit pole' models that include burnt corpses or heads. All meshes retain their vanilla texture paths making them compatible with any vanilla texture replacer.
  
  
I have done my best to improve some of the clipping found in the vanilla corpse meshes. For the 'bandit pole' models I have removed the 2D cards with the red roots from the severed head models. I have also added additional geometry detail to the poles and have redone the pole texture UV's to eliminate some texture stretching present in the vanilla meshes.   
  
  
Optional patches are also available for [Skeleton Replacer HD](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52845) covering 'banditpole07' (the only conflict between the two mods). The 'Less Shiny' optional file is for consistency with [Less Shiny Bloody Bones - Skeleton Replacer HD](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68097). Use only one optional patch file and give it priority / have it overwrite both the Main File and Skeleton Replacer HD. 
  
  
Compatibility:
  
This mod replaces only the mesh files, no plugin/ESP included. No textures are included in the download, your own load order will determine the actual textures used. In my screenshots I'm making use of[Burnt Corpses 4k Retexture- Mihail's Shards of Immersion](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89747)﻿ for the burnt corpses.
  
  
Installation:
  
Use your preferred mod manager to install as per normal.
  
Overwrite if prompted / give my mod priority.
