# Vanilla Forest Logs Pruned

This mod removes the 2D dead branches form the forest log meshes.
  
The 2D branches of the "living" trees do not bother me as they are usually far enough away from the character not to be noticed. But the 2D branches of the fallen tree logs tend to stand out as you traverse the landscape and get up close to them.
  
  
As requested, I have added a version where the lichen/moss has been removed from the stumps for a cleaner look.
  
  
Optional File is to remove the 2D branches from the vanilla aspen logs and stumps for consistency with the main file.
