# FYX - 3D Shack Kit Walls
- Author: Yuril
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

Replaces 2D Skack boards with 3D boards.
  
Use SMIM mesh base
  
  
I made the choice to use the texture of the Riften boards because:
  
- Impossible to make a clean UV's with the vanilla texture.
  
- Some texture mods do not respect the placement of vanilla boards.
  
- Riften boards have several shades of color, which gives a pleasant appearance.
  
  
enjoy !
