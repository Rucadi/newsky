We started this project with the [Diabolic Soul Gems](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/102206) mod.
  
  
At first, our aim was to simply change the soul gems in Skyrim with slightly more thematic ones that were looking more "horrifying" than simple plastic-looking stones.
  
  
After receiving some great feedback in the comments, we decided to expand this idea even further. (Yes, we read all comments).
  
WHY NOT make empty and filled soul gems look different? The filled gems have a freaking SOUL in them, after all - yet in the game both look exactly the same.

Skyrim offers only a single option for filled or empty soul gems. No longer. With this series, you'll eventually have different models for filled and empty soul gems, starting with Lesser Soul Gems.
  
  
Here is a comparison:

This mod not only changes the models and textures but also includes a small plugin that let's the game choose the required model and texture depending on the situation.

What about the other soul gems? 
  
  
All soul gems will be transformed into this format and the end result will also be posted as a single mod, again, on Nexus mods. The reason why I am uploading these gems one by one is simple: The entire project is not finished yet. This takes a very long time. Also, we are collecting your feedbacks along the way too.
  
  
**Installation**Just use your favourite mod manager and don't forget to enable the mod / activate the plugin.
  
You can also install manually. Drag and drop to your data folder.
  
  
**Next In Line**My goal is to finish all soul gem models one by one and then release the full all-in-one version soon enough. 
  
Also, we aim to change the textures / model of the inner soul model since sometimes it creates flickering for some reason we could not figure out yet.
