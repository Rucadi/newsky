**About:**
  
  
Are you tired of all rugs looking perfectly straight and flat? Want a more immersive experience with rugs that look unkempt? Well look no further! 
  
This mod replaces nearly 300 rug references with brand new, disrupted meshes. This is not a straight up model replacer. Not all rugs are affected, only the ones that make sense!
  
  
• Adds 50+ new rug mesh variants (4 total variants per rug including default)
  
• Conflict-free ESL Plugin
  
  
**Interactive version:** 
  
• All common rugs will now have a chance to be messy and can be fixed by the Player by interacting with the center of the rug. The rug will randomly become unkempt again after 1 day but may take as long as 2 in-game weeks to get messy again. If a rug has already been fixed, it won't be interactive until it has become messy again.
  
  
• Unkempt rugs can also trip the Player & other NPC's. The percentage chance amongst other options are configurable in the included MCM Menu.

• [Detailed Rugs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9030) or [RUGNAROK](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5436) (For textures & compatibility)

**Note:** This mod was made for compatibility with the above two texture mods & any other rug mod that uses the same meshes. Vanilla meshes may not be compatible.

**Known Issues / FAQ:**
  
  
1) In some areas my feet clip through the new rugs, can this be fixed?
  
• This unfortunately is a trade-off and the height of rug variants was purposely squashed to prevent further clipping. Custom collision will be made later on if the mod is well received.
  
  
2) Some of the rugs look less rigid and more cloth-like?
  
• This was a byproduct of the previous point and while it couldn't be totally avoided, I wanted a more lively appearance.
  
  
3) I noticed that areas such as Dragonsreach, Inns & Sovngarde don't have unkempt rugs?
  
• These are some of the areas that I felt don't make sense to have unkempt rugs. Palaces & Inns have workers that would keep things clean, whereas Sovngarde should be immaculate.
  
  
4) Why isn't there an LE version?
  
• LE doesn't have Base Object Swapper and would be a compatibility nightmare. A script based version might be made later on.
  
  
5) You missed this other type of rug that's not in the common folder!
  
• Let me know and I'll see about adding it as an update.
