You may have seen my [Periwinkle Deathbells](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77922)﻿ recently, or maybe not! But some people encouraged me to try using BOS to get more colors into the game. I bring you 10 unique Deathbell variations, each color distributed with a 10% random chance. I have put these on a new mod page, since they aren't all Periwinkle anymore and this is a very different mod now. ENB Light and non-ENB Light versions available.

**Please make certain your [Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805) ﻿is up to date or my mod will not work.****For ENB Lights to work please ensure that "EnableComplexParticleLights=true" in effects section of enbseries.ini and "EnableBigRange=true" in complex particle lights section.**
  
My pictures are all taken using [PRT XII](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4743)﻿ with the [Next Gen Graphics](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74949)﻿ add on and NAT Weather. Results may vary in other lighting environments. Please share your pictures! :)
  
  
**~ Installation ~**
  
1. Make sure you have the most up to date version of Base Object Swapper
  
2. Install this, pick your options in the FOMOD
  
3. Load after anything changing the "deathBell" ingredient, CACO patch available in FOMOD. If you don't load after, then the ingredient won't match the plant but the plants themselves will still work. Purely an appearance thing for the **inventory** item.

**~ Compatibility ~**
  
Should be compatible with everything except for mods replacing the same thing. Load after mods like Skyrim 3D Trees that contain a Deathbell ingredient to prevent the ingredient from not showing properly. CACO patch available for those that need the ingredient to match CACO stats. Other than this, if a patch is needed let me know and I might make one. If a patch does not exist you can still use this mod and let the one conflicting with it win, you will just have mismatched Deathbell **inventory** appearance but nothing game breaking.

With the ENB Light version all plants have light color that matches them.
