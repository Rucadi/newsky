There still have been some blocky wood posts in Riften - now they are rounded
  
Mathy fixes a few(docks), some other mod others, but the lower canals were still missing afaik.
  
  
- no esp/esl
  
- Works with any textures, contains just a few meshes
  
  
If Lux or other mods ask, just override them or load this one later, didn't see any problems with running Lux myself
  
Performance seems fine, tried a less poly version, but it still looked bad
  
If your Riften runs at 9 fps this mod is not for you of course.
  
Wood textures used in the screens are not from me afaik
