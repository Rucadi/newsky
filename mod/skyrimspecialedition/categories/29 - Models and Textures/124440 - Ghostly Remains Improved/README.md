It always bothered me how the "ghostly remains" are bright blue and glowing from a distance. Sure, they needed to look "ghostly" but also the other ghost shaders in the game looked horrendous. The latter has been addressed multiple times. Personally, I use the "[Spookier Ghosts](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86190)" shader, but there are other mods as well.
  
  
For some reason, the "ghostly remains" were never touched. Maybe the reason was because they are not affected by whatever shaders you have installed, since all their visuals are defined within the mesh and its vertexes and harder to change? Or maybe I simply did not find any mod that did, and now I wasted half a day.
  
  
But anyway, here is my personal version, maybe you like it.
  
In the pictures you can see the comparison between the blue vanilla version and this mod.
  
  
This is a simple mesh replacer and which will not conflict with any other mod (unless it also edits the "ghostly remains").
  
It includes the "[Floating Ash Pile Fix' solution by wSkeever](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63434), i.e. it will react to gravity and fall properly to the ground (usually). Special thanks to wSkeever!
  
If you have both mods installed, use wSkeever's mod first, and then overwrite it with this one, as it only changes the ghostly remains.
  
  
  
Enjoy.
  
  
If you have an ENB or Reshader installed this may look different in your game; try it out.
  
Can be added or removed any time during gameplay.
