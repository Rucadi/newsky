HERMAEUS MORA
  
My HD version by Xtudo**

**Description**
  
My HD version for the Daedric Prince of Knowledge and Memory. Especially his multiple eyes.
  
See comparison screenshots, but the difference is better spotted in-game.
  
  
**I made it for my game and now I'm sharing it, I hope you like it.**
