# FYX - 3D Stockades - Walls and Gate

I spent a lot of time reworking the posts so that they didn't all look the same and to improve the immersion in the game.
  
There were several versions, I had to restart several times but the result is worth it I think.
  
  
- Replace the octagonal glued posts with smooth and unglued posts.
  
- Replaces the gate and walls to go with the style of the 1st 3D Stockades party.
  
 - Smoothes the structure of the stockades.
  
- Fixed some UVs.
  
  
Enjoy !
