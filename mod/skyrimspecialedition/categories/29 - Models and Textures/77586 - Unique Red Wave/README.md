# Unique Red Wave

This mod is quite simple, once I noticed the duplicated Dainty Sload, I wanted to deal with it, so made a replacement mesh, set up some textures as red and used Base Object Swapper to place the new model. LOD models are included, they will require a regeneration of LOD to show up, but since the LOD mesh is effectively the same as other large boats, seen at LOD distance you might find it isn't worth the time to regenerate for.
  
  
This mod contains no edits to the world, the plugin only contains the static mesh record for BOS to swap to. As long as a mod does not delete the Red Wave, it will be compatible without any need for a patch.
  
  
Plugin is flagged as ESL and ESM.
  
  
Aside from the two red retextured parts, the ship will use whichever ship textures you happen to be using.
  
  
**Requires Base Object Swapper**
