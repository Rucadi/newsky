**Q&A**
  
  
**Q: I have a question.**
  
A: Read the description thoroughly before posting a comment. I am happy to help you with anything not mentioned here.
  
  
**Q: What about Bleeding Crown mushrooms?**
  
A: Nothing really fit what I wanted. Might add it in the future.
  
  
**Q: Why is there an optional glowing Namira's Rot?**
  
A: Because Jack o' Lantern mushrooms have a faint green bioluminescence. 
  
  
**Q: That isn't a Jack o' Lantern mushroom.**
  
A: I just guessed.
  
  
**Q: Just how high poly? Will this impact performance?**
  
A: Really depends on your rig. Namira's Rot meshes have the highest number of vertices, but all of them are comparable to other high poly mushroom mods I've seen. The smallest of these has **942 vertices (972 triangles)** and the highest has **6712 vertices (10944 triangles)**. The vanilla meshes are 426 to 1492 triangles (487-1966 vertices). The "half size" files are **942 vertices (972 triangles)** to **4631 vertices (6930 triangles)**.
  
  
**Q: Does this do anything else?**
  
A: No.
  
  
**Q: Can I add this to an existing game? Can I remove it from an existing game?**
  
A: Yes.
