**As a wine lover, I couldn't miss these models and I wasn't the only one who didn't like the old ones :) So this mod is also for my friends who wanted a change too.
  
  
Update: Argonian Bloodwine and Surilie Brothers Wine from Hearthfire DLC
  
                 Firebrand wine including new crate on request
