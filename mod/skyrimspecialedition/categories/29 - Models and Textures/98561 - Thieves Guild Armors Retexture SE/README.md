This mod retextures the Thieves guild armor, Guild master's armor, Linwe's armor / Blackguard armor, Karliah's armor, the vampire hood worn by Serana and the brown cowl worn by NPCs in the thieves guild. Also contains optional retextures for the Imperial and dark brotherhood bandoliers and pouches from [Bandolier - Bags and Pouches Classic](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2417) and an optional custom replacer for [Oblivion Artifacts Pack SE'](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10644)s Alvante's armor. This set is normally a copy of the Blackguard armor, but this option uses an esl-flagged esp to give it a unique look.

Why is the vampire hood here? Because it shares the same meshes and normal maps as the thieves guild hood. So you need the thieves guild textures installed for it to look as it should.

Uses an esl-flagged esp to give Oblivion Artifacts Pack SE's Alvante's armor a custom look. The meshes are based on vanilla meshes. They will need patches to work correctly with bodyslides like CBBE, 3BA, HIMBO, etc. If you are able to make said patches, please feel free to post them on nexus. No need to ask for my permission first.
