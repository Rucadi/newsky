FEATURES[/b]
  
  
[font=Georgia]-Almost all of the metal in dwemer and markarth architecture is overhauled. This includes dwemer pipes, facades, partitions, doors, decorative structures, and much more. 4K or 2K options.
  
-The pipes are fully integrated with Dwemer Pipeworks Reworked, which adds moving parts, animations and glow to many pipe features.
  
-A patch for improved Dwemer Glass is also available and HIGHLY recommended![/font]
  
  
**HARD REQUIREMENTS**[font=Georgia]-Dwemer Pipeworks Reworked + optional ENB Light Meshes
  
-ENB Particle Patch[/font]
  
  
**RECOMMENDED MODS**[font=Georgia]-Skyland Markarth. However I personally prefer the older version from Skyland AIO, as the stone textures are cleaner.
  
-FranklyHD Markarth. Replaces textures only from markarth structures, doesn't touch dungeons. tbh if you don't have this mod what are you doing
  
[/font][font=Georgia]-Improved Dwemer Glass. HARD requirement if you install the patch.
  
-Glorious Doors of Skyrim. That mod covers large dwemer doors so I didn't touch them.
  
-ENB Dwemer Lanterns. Just let that mod overwrite everything since I didn't retexture the lanterns, but I forgot to take the vanilla lantern meshes out of my mod files... \*nervous laughter\*[/font]
  
  
**FAQ**
  
  
[font=Georgia]**\*\*insert comment here about how it's unrealistic or not lore-friendly\*\***
  
-I don't care. I made the textures because I like a clean, golden look for my dwemer features. If you don't like it feel free to not install. and if you comment about it, I'll ignore you ;)
  
  
**Is it compatible with \*\*insert dwemer retexture mod here\*\*?**
  
-Of course :) I highly recommend using this mod along with Skyland Dwemer Ruins and FranklyHD's Markarth for the dwemer stone textures, but this mod overwrites most of the dwemer metal textures.

[font=Georgia]**Is it compatible with mods that use/add dwemer features?**
  
[/font][font=Georgia]-It's compatible with any mod that only uses vanilla meshes. An example of this is JK's interior/exterior overhauls.[/font][font=Georgia]For mods that add custom-made dwemer meshes that don't exist in the vanilla game, like a lot of trainwhiz mods, a patch will be needed. I will most likely accept your patch request :)
  
[/font]
  
[font=Georgia]**Are you going to add dwemer armor, weapons, etc?**
  
[/font][font=Georgia]-Yes! My plan is to work on matching golden textures for the dwemer armor, weapons and other objects :)
  
  
[/font][font=Georgia]**What about an LE version?**[/font][font=Georgia]-Sorry, I won't make an LE version... I only play on SE. But if someone wants to port it to LE themselves, feel free!
  
[/font][font=Georgia]
  
[/font][font=Georgia]**Where's my 1K version?!**[/font][font=Georgia]-Sorry about your potato PC but textures covering such large objects look bad in 1K...
  
[/font][font=Georgia]
  
[/font][font=Georgia]**Can I make changes/patches for your mod myself, and upload it onto nexus?**[/font][font=Georgia]-Of course you can, just make sure to give credit for whatever you use
