This mod retextures the Ancient Nord armor, Ancient Nord Weapons, Nord Hero Weapons, Helm of Yngol, Draugr's armor, Hulking draugrs' armor and CC Fishing's Ancient Nord weapons and Nord hero weapons. I also added an optional mesh replacer to add pants and/or cubemaps to the Ancient Nord armor.
  
Also contains optional retextures for many mods such as Haugbui, Ancient Nord Armoury EXTREME AE, Ahzidal's enchanted armor, D.E.A.D, The dragon cult, Legacy of the dragonborn, Yngol armor SSE, Skyrim Immersive Creatures SE, Nordic wanderer armor and Elsopa's quivers redone.
  
  
I do not touch the Draugr NPCs themselves, only their armor. So it is compatible with any Draugr Retexture / replacer﻿
  
  
The textures for the Ancient Nord armor are based on [Cabal120's aMidianBorn Book of Silence](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35382)﻿. I used their normal maps as a base to create my retexture. Everything else is based on vanilla textures.
  
  
Works with every mod that also works with vanilla textures, such as Heavy armory and animated armory. If you see any major stretching or dark spots when using a mesh replacer, please let me know by linking the mod in the comments and posting a picture of the bugged area (please spoiler the picture to not take too much space) and I will see if I can fix it.
  
  
Fomod lets you pick and choose what you want. 
  
  
Textures are 2k except Chest armor textures, which are 4k.
  
  
Half-res version available in Optional files (Chest, weapons and shield are 2k, everything else is 1k)
  
  
**FOMOD OPTIONS**
  
  
**BASE INSTALL**
  
  
Choose which of these you want to install
  
  
  
**ANCIENT NORD ARMOR**
  
For the ancient nord armor, you will have the choice between textures only, cubemap addons (metallic reflections) and/or pants.
  
  
**Textures Only

**DRAUGR'S ARMOR**
  
These only affect the armor textures, not the draugrs' bodies. Which means this is compatible with any draugr replacers

**HELM OF YNGOL**
  
Comes in two options. "Ancient nordic" which matches the ancient nord armor or "Ebony" which makes it match with my ebony armor textures. Giving this helmet a more unique look. Pick your favorite option (does not affect the item's stats, only visuals)

**CONSISTENCY PATCHES**
  
  
  
Consistency patches are optional retextures of modded armors, clothes and/or weapons I like. The goal of these is to make these items match my retextures. I do not ever claim that my versions are objectively better, all authors who's work I cover are extremely talented people! The original mods are always a hard requirement.

**AHZIDAL'S ENCHANTED ARMOR**
  
By MANHUNTER69
  
[Link](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97845)Retextures' Ahzidal's enchanted armor. Comes in two variants: Ancient nordic (closer to the vanilla design, uses the ancient nord armor textures for the metal parts) and Ahzidal version, which makes the metal match with my retexture of Ahzidal's mask. Pick your favorite option. Should work with Legacy of the dragonborn's version of this set, but I have not tested it.

**OUTDATED CONSISTENCY PATCHES**
  
These consistency patches have not been updated in the 2.0.0 udpate of this retexture, as I no longer use these mods. The files are still available but I will offer no support for them.
