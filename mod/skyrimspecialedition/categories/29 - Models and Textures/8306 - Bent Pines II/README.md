**FAQ**
  
*Want less trees, better performance, or is a tree in the wrong location - interfering with a mod etc.?* 
  
  
Then go in to the console, click the tree, enter ***disable**.* This will remove the tree from that location. Save your game afterwards.This can be used on everything except for grasses/ground flora. This is also useful when you want to take that epic screenshot, but something is ruining the view for you ;)
  
  
*Don't like the scale?*
  
Go into the console, click the tree, enter ***setscale 0.8*** (or similar values), this will change the scale of the 3D mesh (but not the scale of the collsion box). Default scale is ***1***. Save the game afterwards.
