These mushrooms were created from the vanilla textures using trained artificially-intelligent upscale-models. They also had some manual quality adjustments such as restoring vanilla colors with an overlay to reduce color-noise. 
  
  
Regarding compatibility, these textures use the vanilla mushroom normal maps, so if you have mushroom normal maps from other mods that you are overwriting with Cathedral, you'll want to disable them.

There are two primary philosophies when it comes to modding, Parlor and Cathedral, originally coined by the former modder, [Wrye](http://wryemusings.com/Cathedral%20vs.%20Parlor.html).
  
  
> In the ***Parlor*** view, we consider mods as privately owned works of art displayed in a modder's parlor. We invite others to come appreciate our work. We directly receive compliments and endorsements, encouraging us to produce further work.

  
> In the ***Cathedral*** ***Concept***, we consider modding a joint effort. We share our work with each other to foster further mod development, to keep the community alive, and to contribute in the construction of mods of monumental scale. Individually, our contributions may be small and not worth doing for themselves, but by each person contributing something, we construct something larger and more worthwhile than any of us could do on our own.
