 ﻿? DESCRIPTION
  
  
The only standing remodel of Eversnow, at this very space-time being! (I think, sorry if I've missed!) This is my first mesh made with Blender from scratch. May have some flaws, but I'm pretty content with the output.
  
  
Textures and meshes are optimised using [CAO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23316).
  
  
Patches available for [UAPNG](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97674) & [EAS](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42602). I would recommend UAPNG, since it is both faster and takes effect after actually drinking the beverage instead of instantly when used unlike EAS. Refer to the **[b][color=#ff0000]Compatibility**[/color][/b] and**[b][color=#ff0000]Requirements**[/color][/b] sections down below, as they contain vital notices for intended use.

 ﻿?️ COMPATIBILITY
  
  
Main file is compatible with anything except other Eversnow remodels (duh).
  
  
EAS patch is compatible with and requires [Gourmet EAS Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98185). You are already expected to possess that mod if you have Gourmet & EAS installed.
  
  
UAPNG patch is
  
[/font]

  
* [font=Georgia]compatible with Gourmet EAS Patch. Do not need to do anything on your own to have that mod and my UAPNG patch installed together. UAPNG takes priority over EAS.[/font]
[font=Georgia]incompatible with any mod that edits UAPNG's INI file "UAPNG.ini". I do not know any mod that does that, but it's easy to check and make these compatible. See the spoiler below how to.[/font]
  

[font=Georgia]SpoilerFind original UAPNG mod in your mod manager, and see if its INI file conflicts with any other mod. If it does, find that mod's edited INI and place this line into it below [AllowedPotions] line (without quotation marks):
  
  
"MAG\_DrugsEversnow"
  
  
Afterwards, let that mod's INI (that you edited) win any conflicts including mine.
  
  
The point of editing UAPNG's INI is about whitelisting Eversnow to have it animated.
  
  
Safe to switch between EAS & UAPNG mid game.
