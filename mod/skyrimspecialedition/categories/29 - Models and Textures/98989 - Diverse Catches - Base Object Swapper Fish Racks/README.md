# Diverse Catches - Base Object Swapper Fish Racks

So, you've been hunting and fishing in these parts for years, huh? But you never catch anything more than a couple of salmon? I can walk a foot into the water and grab more fish than I could eat, so what's going on here?
  
  
Storytime... (Feel free to skip this bit.)
  
  
Okay, so this mod came about because of a mesh in the game that I absolutely hate: the fishingpolecollection01.nif. What could be nicer than a collection of fishing rods? So recreational...so scenic...so WTF are they standing in? Are they meant to be pots? Pipes? Some metal cup? Whoever stood a fishing rod in a cup for storage? I hate it, and every time I see it, it takes me out of the game. I decided I would get rid of it, but what could I replace it with? What might be on the river bank that could more realistically have fishing poles balanced on it? And Diverse Catches was born. Okay, that's the end of my odd little tale; now, onto the mod...
  
  
(Skip to here...)
  
Details...
  
  
This mod adds twelve more variants of the fishrack01.nif to the game. Each rack has a varied catch or a little story to tell. Some hauls are better than others, and they change on cell loads, so it'll feel more like someone's adding and removing the fish as they catch more or sell them. It doesn't interfere with the placement of the salmon01 and salmon02 nifs, so you'll still be able to harvest those catches as in the vanilla game. The diverse catches are just props and don't add more harvestable ingredients. Take a look at the image gallery for an idea of what to expect.
  
  
Each variant was put together using resources from [mathy79](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/12770808)'s awesome repository and [kelretu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3624945)'s excellent modder's resource pack. If you dig the mod, please give some kudos to the asset creators. Thanks, Mathy and Kelretu!! 
  
  
So, what's in the mod?
  
  
1.) There's an esl flagged esp that adds the new records for the different fishracks, along with the models and textures.
  
  
2.) There's an optional download that replaces the salmon01 and salmon02 meshes so that they are tied to the racks with rope and not nailed to them. They are harvestable in a Wiseman303 fixes way, too. See the gallery for a bit more info on that.
  
  
3.) There's also an optional download that replaces the god-awful nif (I hate you, fishingpolecollection01!) with a single fishing pole. You might find it in a boat or on the bank, and it gets rid of that pot/cup/pipe weirdness altogether. Of course, the fishing pole collection may not bother you at all. I get it; I'm strange :) And so this part of the mod is entirely optional.
  
  
That's about it. Some of the racks are more complex and may affect your FPS. I've tried to limit this by combining as many branches in the nifs as possible. The textures in the mod are 2k.
  
  
As always, thanks for checking out the mod! Enjoy!
