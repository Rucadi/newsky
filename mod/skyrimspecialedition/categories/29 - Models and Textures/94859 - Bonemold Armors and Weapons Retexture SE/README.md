This mod retextures the Bonemold Armor, Bonemold Reinforced Armor, Bonemold Guard Armor, Bonemold Shield, CC Curios' Bonemold bolts and contains an optional retexture for [Beyond Skyrim Morrowind - Bonemold Weapon Pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66906)﻿'s Weapons, quiver and shields
  
  
This mod contains textures only. Meaning it is compatible with every mod that works with vanilla Bonemold textures.
  
  
The Bonemold Armors and shield textures are based on Cabal's [Amidianborn book of silence SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35382)﻿. I used their textures as a base to create mine.
