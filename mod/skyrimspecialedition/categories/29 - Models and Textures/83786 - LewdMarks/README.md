All marks are redrawn from scratch based on references found on the web (anime/manga/arts/photo).
  
Textures are in two options, normal and "halo", created for the [BHUNP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31126) & [CBBE 3BA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30174)
  
SVG files are also published as a resource for moders, you can use them for any of your own mods.
  
  
To get a glow effect, use two corresponding textures (non-glow and glow), set two layers and adjust a desired color, transparency, glow
  
strength, etc..
