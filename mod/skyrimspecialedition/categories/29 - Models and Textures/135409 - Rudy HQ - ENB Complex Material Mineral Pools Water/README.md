Just a small enhancement. ENB Complex Material for Mineral Pools Water. Compatible with [**Water for ENB**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37061).
  
  
Adds reflections to these meshes through ENB Dynamic Cube Maps. Two color versions to choose from.
  
  
**BLUE - should be compatible with "Water for ENB - Patch - Blue Volcanic Water"**

**TEAL - should be compatible with pure "Water for ENB"**

**Reminder:**
  

  
  
Meshes have modified shaders, don't overwrite them.
  
  
Textures have unique names, so there should be no compatibility problems.
  
  
I changed the animation of the "waves" a bit, hopefully for the better.
  
  
Don't expect everything to be reflected in Dynamic Cubemaps. Outdoors the sky and LoD are reflected, indoors pretty much everything except transparent things, so special effects like fire etc. are not reflected.
  
  
In “enbseries.ini” you must have these effects enabled:
  
  
EnableComplexParallax=true
  
EnableComplexMaterial=true
  
EnableDynamicCubemap=true
  
  

  
  
Remember that this modification requires the use of ENB to work properly.
