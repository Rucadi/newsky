[font=Georgia]Very simple mod, I couldn't really find a Shadowmark retexture that suited me, so I worked on these and thought others might like the option to use them.
  
Textures are a bit darker than vanilla and not glossy because that made no sense to me. They should be more secret than that, townspeople shouldn't be finding them so easily.
  
Texture size is 512, vanilla was 256. I didn't see the point of going higher than 512 for something so small. It would be using up your performance for literally nothing. I honestly didn't run around to find every mark in game to take a picture of it, but they are all retextured.
  
  
[/font][font=Georgia]These should not be giving anyone a performance impact, but if anyone would like it I can upload the vanilla resolution size of 256. Just let me know :)
  
  
[/font][font=Georgia]Happy Modding Everyone!
