Have you ever wondered why Whiterun's architecture looks like swiss emmental cheese and is full of holes?
  
If yes then you're in the right place as this mod fixes (quite some of) it.
  
No more rain going straight into Ysolda's house. No more useless entrance cover for the guards. No more tripping in the gaps of the dragon bridge.
  
This fixes various architecture points like roofs, bridges and others in Whiterun, so it isn't filled with holes anymore. Also fixes some uv errors and glow map issues [font=Arial]of these meshes[/font].
  
No textures included, see recommended mods (I use mostly CleverCharff's with some textures of Skyland).
