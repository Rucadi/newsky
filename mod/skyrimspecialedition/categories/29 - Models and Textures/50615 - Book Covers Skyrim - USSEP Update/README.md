A simple update to forward USSEP changes to Book Covers Skyrim. Changes mainly include book text and object bounds, as well as a handful of changes to value and pick up sounds. The naming conventions of Book Covers Skyrim is unchanged, the only changes made to names are a couple of notes which only differed in capitalisation. Works by replacing the original .esp from BCS.
  
  
For v1.2 I redid the whole thing from scratch since it's been four years and I figured it was best to take a fresh look at it. As with previous versions I haven't forwarded cell changes from USSEP, me from 2021 claims BCS makes it's own changes to correct certain books being placed upside down. I'll choose to trust him.
  
  
For what it's worth TES VI may as well be released by the time I update this again, so I'll reassure you that if USSEP makes further changes (and nobody else makes an update) you can continue using this. It carries the bulk of changes made since 2017 and your game isn't going to explode just because one or two typos aren't forwarded. I also want to thank everyone that has used this little patch over the years, I'm glad to have helped. (Also I'm pretty sure you can't get it anymore but the success of this mod at the time got me access to lifetime Nexus premium, so that's pretty cool, thanks again.)
