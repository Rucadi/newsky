**Description**
  

  
* Vanilla rope bridges don't make sense:
    
  [list]
Ropes do not connect to each other.
  
* Top ropes do nothing except act as a really slack railing.

[\*]This mod fixes these issues and more:
  

  
* Ropes are connected to each other like real life rope bridges.
Top ropes now have a structural reason to exist.

**FAQ**
  
> Q: What is the recommended "load order"?
>   
> A: Whatever files win "conflicts" will appear in game. Since you're downloading this mod, I am guessing you want this mod to show up in game, so logically, you should let this mod override [Stockades of Skyrim 3D](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43227)﻿ and [Static Mesh Improvement Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/659)﻿. If you downloaded a texture mod that replaces SMIM textures, I am guessing you want that to show up in game as well, so logically, you should let those textures override the default SMIM textures from this mod. But I am just guessing. it is your game, and you do what you want.
