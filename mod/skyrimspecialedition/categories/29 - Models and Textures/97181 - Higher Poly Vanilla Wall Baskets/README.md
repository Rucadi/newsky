# Higher Poly Vanilla Wall Baskets

I created these higher poly meshes for my other mod [Wall Basket Variants](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97184) and thought I might as well post these as a standalone replacer.
  
SMIM replaces the 2D feathers of the vanilla baskets with proper 3D ones but does not change the baskets itself. So I used SMIM as a starting point and then smoothed out the round baskets and five sided sticks that the feathers hang from.
  
  
Static Mesh Improvement Mod (SMIM) is a hard requirement else you will not have the feather textures and these will be purple in your game. Load my mod after SMIM (overwrite the SMIM meshes)
  
  
Compatibility:
  
This mod replaces only the mesh files, no plugin/ESP included. No textures are included in the download, your own load order will determine the actual textures used.
  
  
Installation:
  
Use your preferred mod manager to install as per normal.
  
Overwrite when prompted / give my mod priority.
