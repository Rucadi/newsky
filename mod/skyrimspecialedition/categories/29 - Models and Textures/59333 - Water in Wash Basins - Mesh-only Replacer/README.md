# Water in Wash Basins - Mesh-only Replacer

After seeing [Water in Wells by wSkeever](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57268?tab=description), I thought it would be nice to see a similar feature for wash basins found in many houses in Skyrim. Since wSkeever's mod resources have lenient permissions, I wanted to give it a shot by using their mesh\textures on the wash basin mesh, and this is the result.

FEATURES
  
  

  
* Simple mesh replacer, so no ESP needed
Compatible with any retextures of the vanilla mesh
  
* Transparent water; it may almost be invisible in some angles, but that's by design to make it look like "calm" water without it being 100% static

  
INSTALLATION 
  
  

  
* Install with your preferred mod manager. If you're using [Water in Wells by wSkeever](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57268?tab=description), my mod contains some of their textures, so you can let either mod overwrite each other (preferably theirs, in case they update them).
[Check out this patch for a higher quality model!](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77505?tab=description) Install their mod after installing mine first (required to have the textures).
  

  
COMPATIBILITY
  
  

  
* Not compatible with mods that change the wash basin mesh.
If you prefer a mod that adds real Skyrim water into the wash basins, [please check this mod!](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/122211)﻿
  
  
* May cause minor conflict with mods that manually place water within wash basins in the world (e.g. [JK's Temple of Kynareth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56737)), but it's easily patched.﻿
[Fancy Washbasin Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57582?tab=description)﻿ has a patch for this
  
* Probably not compatible with [Interactive Wash Basins](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56039?tab=description).
