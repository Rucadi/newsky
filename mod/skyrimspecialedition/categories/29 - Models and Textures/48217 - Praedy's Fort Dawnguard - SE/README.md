* There's 3 different versions, v1 is the same as the original but with updated diffuses, v2 as less damages and v3 has new textures, pick whichever one you like, V3 being the "official / recommended" option.
Includes new banner textures and unique door textures which will only be used for fort dawnguard instead of also being used by the college of winterhold (The vanilla Fort Dawnguard uses the same doors the college does).
  
* Plugins are available in ESP and ESPFE formats, they're required for banner and door changes.

**DISCLAIMER :**I do not recommend using mods such as BENDR as i've seen evidence of it creating "details" where there shouldn't be, as well as making the specular maps completely black in some cases.If you are using the textures provided by BENDR or something similar for this mod, do not expect things to look identical or better than what you see in the screenshots on the mod page.Any issues that arise from using bendr textures for this mod are on you, i will not be fixing anything related to it.Normal maps cranked to 11 with extra, random "details" and missing (black) specular does not equal improved.My mods have open permissions so other Mod Authors can create new, additional content, but things like this feel more like an insult than anything else...
