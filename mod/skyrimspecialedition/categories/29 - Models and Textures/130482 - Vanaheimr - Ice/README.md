Required
  
  
[Vanaheimr - Marsh](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/121602)﻿ for consistent texture blending.
  
  
[IMR](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73381)
  
  
Installation :
  
  
  
Download the version you prefer (4k, 2k) and install it using your preferred mod manager. ( Load after IMR ( and Vanaheimr - Marsh if you use it. )).
  
  
  
If you are not using Vanaheimr - Snow, you may encounter issues with the *glaciercaveentrance*.
  
To fix this problem, simply create a *Statics* folder inside your *Landscape* folder (*Textures/Landscape/Statics*) and copy-paste the *snow01* texture into it.
  
For proper blending, make sure the texture does not have an alpha channel (or if it does, it should be fully white).
  
You can also use the *projecteddiffuse* texture (*Textures/Effects*), which should be the same as *snow01* but without an alpha channel.
