Hi everyone!
  
  
This wasn't the mod I was meant to be working on :D but it's something that's bugged me for a long time and so I decided to attempt to tackle it. The dust beams in Skyrim use two textures to give the effect of dust passing through a beam of light. There's a dust texture and (for some reason) a cloud texture. The cloud texture is animated to give the appearance of dust motes caught in light. The problem is, that it doesn't look anything like dust. In order to fix this, I've created two new dust textures which I've then applied to the mesh. Now, when you look into a beam of dust, it'll actually have dust moving through it.
  
  
Now, this is the kind of mod where your mileage may vary depending on your setup. I use Rudy ENB for Cathedral Weather alongside Lux. The mod will work with any ENB or CS preset (or vanilla) but may appear lighter or darker depending on your setup. As the mod is a mesh and texture replacer you can install it, test it out, and safely uninstall if if you don't like it without any ill-effects for your save.
  
  
Installation:
  
  
1) (Optional but recommended) install [Glorious Gradients](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/79583).
  
1b) Install this mod with Vortex or MO2 and overwrite if/when prompted. Enjoy!
  
  
This mod can be used with another dust texture such as [TB's Improved Dust Particles](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39003). Install that mod first and then this one second. Obviously your results will vary from the images in the gallery.
