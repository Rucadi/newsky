**ARMORS OF THE CRUSADER**

My goal for these sets was to make them match my recent update of my [Silver Armors and Weapons Retexture](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89109). I thought the bright metal and more vibrant gold on the crusader set would help with the "Divine" aspect of these sets. And I wanted both versions to match, unlike vanilla divine crusaders, where the reforged set is darker than the base crusader set.

CONSISTENCY PATCHES
  
  
Consistency patches are optional retextures of modded armors, clothes and/or weapons I like. The goal of these is to make these items match my retextures. I do not ever claim that my versions are objectively better, all authors who's work I cover are extremely talented people! The original mods are always a hard requirement.
