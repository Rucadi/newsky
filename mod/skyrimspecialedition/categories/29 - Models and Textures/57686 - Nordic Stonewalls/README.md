New custom stonewalls with 3d geometry, three different versions.
  
  
The most common stonewalls are included, for example those seen in Riverwood.
  
  
As per usual, any suggestions are also very welcome.
  
  
**PERFORMANCE**
  
For Version 1.x, each stonewall object is roughly equal to one to two trees while the Version 2.x & 3.x objects are heavier in geometry since the stonewalls are composed of individual rocks. That said, there are usually only a handful of these objects in any given location so while there's definitely more geometry than in vanilla you probably won't see much difference in actual framerate due to these.
  
  
All versions include options for 4K textures for high details and 2K textures for reduced memory consumption.
  
  
Version 2.x & 3.x by default uses your mountain texture for stonewalls so they will be in the same resolution as those and use no additional memory.
  
  
Version 2.x & 3.x also include my custom Nordic stonewall textures (shown in most of the images) in both 2K and 4K resolution.
  
  
**COMPATIBILITY**Version 1.x maintains the proportions of the vanilla assets so these should work (and tile) exactly the same as the vanilla ones.
  
  
Version 2.x stonewalls are shorter than vanilla and will cause issues with mods that place stuff on top of the stonewalls. Base Object Swapper is being used to lift the stonewalls up in appropriate locations without cell changes so that they are as tall as possible. Currently there are hundreds of instances already included but more are being added when I come across them. Please also feel free to report any issues you spot.
  
  
Version 3.x stonewalls match the vanilla stonewall proportions so they should work the same as the vanilla ones without any patches.
  
  
Version 1.x installer contains an option for Majestic Mountains style stonewall texture so they will match the look of Majestic Mountains if you use that.
  
  
**PATCHES**To my knowledge, only version 2.x needs patching and there a few patches included in the installer:
  
[JK's Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6289)
  
[JK's White Phial](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47713)
  
[Lux Via](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63588)
  
  
The patches for JK's Skyrim ja Lux Via use Base Object Swapper so no plugins needed and no cell changes.
  
  
Additionally, [inscenique](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/103598648) has created a [patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/105906?tab=description) for their great [Harvest Ivy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/103053) mod.
  
  
Any ivy modifications using vanilla UV mapping and referencing vanilla textures will work. Others will require patching.
  
  
**PARALLAX**
  
Version 1.x & 2.x provide an installer option to use parallax for the stones. It's not a massive difference by any stretch of imagination but it does help the moss to stick out.
  
  
Version 3.x only uses parallax - if chosen during installation - for the small stretches of terrain accompanying some the objects.
  
  
**TEXTURES**
  
It's possible to replace the textures with your own if you want to match the stonewalls to some other asset. A typical tiling texture will work perfectly fine.
  
  
The textures are as follows:
  
  
**VERSION 1.x**
  
  
Boulders
  
textures/mx/stonewall01\_c.dds
  
textures/mx/stonewall01\_n.dds
