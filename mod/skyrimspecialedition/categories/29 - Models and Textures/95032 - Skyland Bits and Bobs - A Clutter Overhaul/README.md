**1.91 Update**[/size]

  
* Added textures for dead animal wooden base that was missing from other animal wooden base textures.
 Included more 1k textures instead of 512 for better fidelity. 
  

  
**Install:**
  
Install with your mod manager of choice. Place above other clutter texture mods and below SMIM or just use this one mod.
  
For best experience, use with Skyland AIO. Some clutter pieces use architectural textures and you may see mixed textures if you use a mod other than Skyland AIO or the individual Skyland mods.
  
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
If placed above lighting mods, you may not see the lantern textures. Either hide the lighting mod lantern textures, place this below lighting mods, or simply just use the lighting mod textures for lanterns.
  
  
Works perfectly with SMIM. And is highly suggested to use. Place below other mods that texture similar items.
  
  
Can be used the RCI although you may not see some textures due to RCI meshes and new file paths. I prefer to use without RCI.
  
  
**Messed Up Snow Chests**If you have snow chests that do not look quite right, you're not using SMIM. Skyrim has a texture set in the base game that overwrites some textures causing an issue. The fix can be found here, even if you're not running SMIM with my mod: [Snow Chest Fixed - SMIM Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/105928?tab=files)
  
  
**Special Thanks**
  
To everyone in my Discord and who joined live during the streams creating this mod. Your input and testing has been amazing. Thank you!
  
  
**FAQ:**
  
Q: Are these included in Skyland AIO?
  
A: No. Skyland AIO is already too huge and it's focus and vision is landscape and architecture overhaul.
  
  
Q: Are some of these textures the same as in other Skyland mods like blacksmith and furniture?
  
A: Yup. Same textures. You can get those as individual mods or you can use this mod for all your clutter needs.
  
  
Q: Is this mod compatible with other mods that offer new meshes and/or textures for clutter?
  
A: Yes, you can put this mod above those so you'll see them in your game. If you place this mod below other clutter mods, you may have purple meshes or remapped meshes and the texture will show up weird. Other than that, this mod is compatible with everything else.
