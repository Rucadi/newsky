# Elegant Werewolf Replacer with Player Only and Randomized Options

Elegant Werewolf Overhaul was deleted due to CinnaMewRoll's building stress over it and modding in general. No, I will not hand out copies of it (mostly because I don't have it anyway), but information on this mod page will remain because I know people will still have copies and such.
  
Note that you MUST use version 1.1 in the Misc Files of my mod here for it to work for the time being.
  
  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
Hello all! Finally got a new mod out, and of course it's werewolf related haha. But this time, it's something pretty fresh.
  
  
With the meshes and textures originally made by the author of the Game of Thrones dragons, KaienHash, and posted with his permission, I bring you our Elegant Werewolves! Made to appear more as a real wild wolf and less like a monster, this replacer is created from complete scratch, with 3D haircards to make it feel more dynamic and majestic.
  
And thanks to the help of other mod authors and the efforts of myself, we have improved and polished textures as of 7/19/2024!
  
All body textures have been cleaned and tweaked by XilaMonstrr, but original credits of their creation remain! Which include CinnaMewRoll and LilyValley.
  
  
**The replacer comes in many color choices, and all textures are of the following resolution at default, aiming for a balance between quality detail and performance.**
  
Body/head textures: 4K
  
Eyes, Mouth and Fur: 2K
  
Claws: 1K
  
**Optionally, you can pick the half res main file instead, in which the textures are the following:** 
  
Body/head textures: 2K
  
Eyes, Mouth and Fur: 1K
  
Claws: 512/512
  
  
By default, this mod replaces all werewolves, but there is an optional ESP included that will make this change player-only, allowing it to work alongside Moonlight Tales and Diverse Werewolves Collection.
  
Eventually the goal will be to have enough different types of Elegant Werewolves to straight up replace Moonlight Tales and Diverse Werewolves' skins. But for now, they can merely co-exist, and the player will be the only Elegant Werewolf. 
  
  
The installer is a FOMOD, allowing you to pick your fur pattern (33), eye color (28), mesh shape (4) and more! This is why, as a side effect, the download is so large. This is also why there is the 'Trimmed' version. Download this instead if you want a smaller download and are okay with fewer options!
  
  
Trimmed has 10 patterns (down from 33), 10 eye colors (down from 28), and only the choice between XilaMonstrr's Normalmaps or the Default. Everything else is the same.
  
  
Below I'll describe the different body choices, because I can't show everything in images. Including the long promised 'tasteful' female model is finally here! I am terribly sorry that it took me so long to do this, but hopefully it is worth the wait.
  
  
**Default:** This is the base option, though different from the old 1.1 version. This is the best balance between elegance and intimidation IMO, and is my personal favorite.
  
  
**Soft:** This is basically the old 1.1 version with a softer, less intimidating expression and facial structure. But still keeping the upgrades of 1.5, including longer claws, improved mouth and the like.
  
  
**Female:** The changes from 'Default' are subtle, but intentionally so. The chest, of course, has been lightly modified for a more feminine figure, and various aspects of her has been smoothed, narrowed and softened, without making her overly slim. In nature, it is very difficult to tell between a male and a female wolf, and while we're dealing with werewolves here, I still wanted to retain that and not make her look weak or sexualized.
  
  
**Terror:** This is my attempt at a frightening, monstrous version of the Elegant Werewolf. Sort of breaking the purpose of the mod, but due to so many negative comments about it, I wanted to at least attempt to provide a scarier option, so here it is. Teeth were enlarged and gnarled, eyebrows were made more prominent, the snout shortened, ears reshaped and other subtle tweaks.
  
  
Also, I want to do a quick rundown on some of the optional files, and the difference between Standalone and Player only.
  
  
**Standalone:** This includes an ESL-flagged ESP that redirects the base werewolf model to the chosen Elegant Werewolf mesh, for compatibility. Originally, this was thought to make the player unique, but this is only the case if you're using things like DWC (which you should choose this Standalone option if you are using that mod).
  
This option is good if you find Elegant Werewolf conflicting with some of your existing werewolf mods, like NPC replacers and such.
  
  
**Player Only:** The true, actual player only option. This includes an ESP, flagged as an ESL, that redirects the player's model to a new copy, leaving NPCs alone. This option is NOT compatible with custom races or [Aetherius](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26686) however. (Possibly other mods that edit the races are also not capable, but I will test this.)
  
  
Now, for the **Optional Files** section... Which, by the way, all require at least one version of the main file
  
  
**Base Replacer:** This is a simplified, tweaked replacer that overwrites the vanilla mesh, and has a tweaked texture path from the main mod. What's the purpose of this? Well, it's for users of the Player Only option, but may still want some variant of Elegant Werewolves to replace NPCs. This version is very cut down, with only 6 pattern and eye color choices, and lacking the female mesh option since most NPC werewolves are canonly male.
  
So, for example, you can install the main mod and be a White Female werewolf with Red Eyes via the Player Only option. Then you can download this and make NPCs into Black Default werewolves with Gold eyes.
  
I plan to expand this in the future, when I have more time.
  
  
And in this Optional FIles section is a **Patches and Addons** download. This includes the following, and is to be expanded in the future.
  
  
**Elegant Lobo:** Straightforward patch, really. But this gives the companion Lobo (base mod required) an Elegant werewolf model. It's the terror model to be specific, with a modified Rock Timber texture to include his muzzle scar.
  
  
**Elegant La Femme Lycana Patch:** This is a simple one too, but basically it's a patch for the La Femme Lycana mod, to use my mod's female model instead. You need the original mod still, and then just allow this to overwrite it.
  
  
**Randomized Elegant Werewolves:** This is a more experimental file, using the mod [Model Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/136461) (which is required for this addon) to create randomized NPC werewolves, sort of as a mini DWC for people NOT using that mod. Do note however that unless you are using the Player Only option in the main file, then you will also be randomized!
  
I have no idea if this is capable with DWC, but I imagine if you're using that, you'd likely be better off with it. And do note that this mod will randomize the appearance of werewolf NPCs like Farkas and Sinding in his werewolf form (unless you have a mod that gives them a unique model).
  
Currently, it has 10 possible combos, stemming from the 'Trimmed' version of this mod, and all are using the Default mesh. I may expand this if people end up liking it haha.
  
  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
This update has been a long time coming, and I still have more planned in due time, but for now I will likely go on break again save for any bugfixing. Which reminds me, if you do encounter a bug, please tell me! This mod has essentially been repackaged from it's old 1.1 version, so mistakes are possible!
  
  
And as a disclaimer for the screenshots, many of the 'promo' ones were taken with my ReShade on, but screenshots meant to be identifiers for colors have my ReShade shut off for a more accurate showing of the patterns/colors.
  
All screenshots do have Community Shaders enabled however (except a few recent ones from a mostly vanilla game cause I haven't remodded my game yet.)
  
  
**Questions and Answers:**
  
  
Q: Will you make XYZ color?
  
A: Maybe, give me details and I can either try to do it myself, or see if Kaien would be up for the task.
  
  
Q: Is this capable with DWC?
  
A: Yes, just pick the standalone ESP at the end of the installer.
  
  
Q: Can you make that ESP into an ESL?
  
A: As of update 1.7, it is now ESL flagged!
  
  
Q: Okay what about Growl? Is this capable with that?
  
A: It should be capable with just about every werewolf mod out there! 
  
  
Q: Including Moonlight Tales?
  
A: Yup! Just disable the appearance system.
  
  
Q: What about werewolf skeleton replacers? Will this work with those?
  
A: They should work fine!
  
  
Q: How about capability with NSFW werewolf mods or MFA?
  
A: Sadly no, as that will require a lot more advanced work than I am capable of, and I rather not add NSFW to these models.
  
  
Q: If I were to make a new texture or mesh edit, will you add it to the mod?
  
A: Yes! I'd be happy to! Feel free to PM me about it.
  
  
Q: Why are you posting this mod instead of KaienHash?
  
A: Because I funded the work (and then further improved it from the original), and in his words: "Treat it like a car. It's yours, I'm just the manufacturer."
  
  
Q: Why are they so dumb/goofy/'furry' looking?
  
A: I wanted them to look like natural wolves, not a hideous monster. If you don't like it, there are alternatives. Toxic and nonconstructive comments will be reported.
  
  
Q: Why is the main 4K file so BIG?!
  
A: There's a lot of options, with 33 patterns alone making up for the bulk of the size. Try the 2K or the Trimmed version for a smaller file size.
  
  
Q: What options are in the Trimmed version?
  
A: For patterns, that is Black, Brown, Grey, White, and the four LilyValley versions, plus Timber and Dark Timber. For eye colors, they are Aurora, Blue, Brown, Emerald, Gold, Green, Orange, Purple, Red, and Sapphire.
  
  
Q: So wait, I thought CinnaMewRoll made the Elegant Werewolf, from the Overhaul!
  
A: They did great work in making the facial animations and has helped provide a good deal of stuff to this mod. But no, in the end, this is the original mod. Me and KaienHash are the original creators, we worked on this together.
  
  
Q: What happened to EWO? Why is it gone?
  
A: See top of this mod description. But TLDR: It was stressing CinnaMewRoll out.
  
  
Q: Will you make a fluffworks patch?
  
A: No sadly, as shell texturing hurts my eyes too much to look at. However, someone did make their own patch, as found here: [Hairwolf](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/140125)
  
  
**Some quick notes for users of Elegant Werewolf Overhaul!**
  
  
You MUST use version 1.1 of my mod for EWO or you WILL have issues! You can find it under the Misc of my files.
  
  
If you don't mind Rock Timber + Yellow eyes for the player/base werewolf, feel free to download my optional, much smaller file for Elegant Werewolf Overhaul users, so they don't have to download the big main file. 
  
AKA my main file is only required for Elegant Werewolf Overhaul if you want all the color options to choose from for yourself.
  
  
Please do not report problems about stretching ears and such on my mod page if you are using Elegant Werewolf Overhaul. It's not my doing and there's nothing I can do about it. Follow the author's instructions on that mod page to help prevent it.
  
  
Do not use my standalone ESP file in my main mod if you are using Elegant Werewolf Overhaul. It's not needed since that mod actually uses Elegant Werewolves for Diverse Werewolves Collection. Mine's a band-aid, EWO actually solves the problem.
  
  
If you don't like Rock Timber + Yellow eyes, download the main file or replace the smaller file's base textures with some from EWO.
  
  
If you still have missing texture problems with my optional file, let me know and I'll see what I forgot.
  
  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
**Future Plans:**
  
More textures/patterns
  
Make a full replacer for DWC/Moonlight Tales.
  
Make an option to give unique NPCs their own models (like Farkas, Sinding, Aela and such)
  
  
**Credits:** KaienHash for the model and the silver, ginger and sand timber textures, which I used to create the other colors. He also made the ice and fern eyes, which I edited to make the rest of the base colors. [LilyValley807](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/26189464) for any texture with Valley in the name or any she is credited to (a good number of the eyes), as well as updating the model and polishing it up a little bit, and providing a new optional set of normal maps and adding an environment map for the eyes.
  
Credit to XilaMonstrr for polishing up the body textures, cleaning up compression artifacts, and telling me how to add a glowmap to the werewolf eyes.
  
And credit to CinnaMewRoll for the improved mouth mesh and textures!
