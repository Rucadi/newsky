Bethesda really did a great job with the designs of Skyrim's dragons, creating a cast of iconic and memorable creatures. 
  
The various retexture mods like [HD Reworked Dragons Collection 4K](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36038#), [RUSTIC DRAGONS](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37700) or [Iconic's Dragon Retexture](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/101712) go a long way in bringing the models up to par with modern assets, but the meshes remain at a relatively low polygon count for such large assets. So I decided to create higher polygon meshes to compliment ﻿the high resolution textures.
  
  
I have reworked the vanilla meshes into higher poly meshes, covering all the base game and DLC dragons. All meshes retain vanilla texture paths, so they are compatible with all vanilla dragon retextures. 
  
If you would like to complete your higher poly dragon overhaul you can also consider my other mod: [Higher Poly Vanilla Dragon Skeleton and Bone Clutter](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/94508)
  
  
Technical Information and Performance:
  
The higher poly meshes increases the polygon count of all vanilla dragons by 3-4 times that of the vanilla meshes. Thus the triangle count increases from an average of around 17,000 tringles (vanilla) to around 58,000 (higher poly). As a point of refence, the average triangle count of the popular Game Of Thrones dragon mod are around 248,000.
  
  
Regarding performance impact: I have not run any in depth tests, but I did not notice any major impact during normal game play. I believe the higher poly meshes' polygon count is still reasonable and should have a minimal impact on any relatively modern machine.   
  
  
Compatibility:
  
This mod replaces only the mesh files, no plugin/ESP included. No textures are included in the download, your own load order will determine the actual textures used.
  
My mod is also compatible with [Immersive Dragons](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18957?tab=description) (highly recommended). Let my mod overwrite Immersive Dragons.
  
It has also been reported to be compatible with [Immersive Dragons Resized](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38190?tab=description&BH=0), [Diverse Dragons Collection](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/695) and [Infinite Dragon Variants](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74983?tab=description)﻿ in the comments (not tested by myself, though).
  
[Majestic Dragons](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120239) is compatible as well.
  
  
In the Optional Files section you will find a patch for the exellent [Edmond's ALDUIN THE WORLD-EATER (Ultra HD Dragon Retexture)](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/88135) by [EdmondNoir](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/36563980). I would like to thank [Titanbass1](http://www.nexusmods.com/users/32373690) and [DrMonops](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/17251819?tab=user+files) for creating and sharing this patch. Overwrite / give priority to the patch over both Higher Poly Vanilla Dragons and Alduin The World-Eater.
  
  
Installation:
  
Use your preferred mod manager to install as per normal.
  
Overwrite if prompted / give my mod priority.
