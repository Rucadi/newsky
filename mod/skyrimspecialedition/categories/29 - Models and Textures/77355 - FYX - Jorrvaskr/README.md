The USSEP mesh corrects a lot of things already but has created new faults.
  
So I tried to fix that.
  
  
- Fix some UV's 
  
- Fix tangent space 
  
- Add Vertex alpha and smooth the stone ring
  
- smooth some wood parts
  
- Fix vertex conection
  
- Adds an ornamental detail to the back of Jorrvaskr
  
- Fix the vertex color of the carved wood parts.
  
- Fix the floating chimney beams and add wood curve also at right
  
- No ESP
  
  
Safe to install / uninstall anytime.
  
Must be compatible with everything.
  
  
Enjoy !
