This mod retextures the Leather armor, Fur armor, Hide armor and shield, Studded armor, Scaled and Scaled Horn armor, CC Leather Scout armor, CC netch leather armors and shields, CC Backpacks and covers the custom textures for the CC Hide and fur brawler's fists (leather and scaled brawler's fists do not use any custom textures). Optional mesh replacer to add pants or pants and sleeves to all these armors. Also contains optional retextures for [Legacy of the dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802)﻿'s Boots of the apostle, Predator's Grace, Gloves of the pugilist, Morvath's boots, Running man's folly and Tumbler Bane gloves, [Oblivion Artifacts Pack SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10644)﻿'s Boots of the swift merchant, [NordwarUA](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/NordwarUA)﻿'s/[Sentinel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/100985)﻿'s Hide, hide studded, padded, nordic padded, leather lamellar, nordic leather and rugged leather armors and Atomec's [Rough leather armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23725)﻿. 
  
  
The textures for the fur armor are based on [Cabal120's aMidianBorn Book of Silence](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35382)﻿. I used their normal maps as a base to create my retexture. 
  
All other textures in this mod are based on vanilla normal maps, since the 2.0 update.
  
  
Works with every mod that also works with vanilla textures, such as Armor variants expansion. 
  
  
Fomod lets you pick and choose what you want. 
  
  
  
**Main file**: chest textures are 4k, everything else is 2k
  
**Half-res file**: Chest, Backpacks and shield are 2k, everything else is 1k
  
**Low-res file**: Half-res file: Chest, Backpacks and shield are 1k, everything else is 512

**MESH REPLACERS**Pick and choose between these optional mesh replacers that will add pants, pants and sleeves or gloves to many items. You can pick between meshes based on vanilla or [HDT-SMP Vanilla armors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/142450)﻿. You will need a patch to work correctly with non-vanilla bodies (open permission for this. If you do a patch, please let me know and I will link it here)

**CONSISTENCY PATCHES**
  
  
Consistency patches are optional retextures of modded armors, clothes and/or weapons I like. The goal of these is to make these items match my retextures. I do not ever claim that my versions are objectively better, all authors who's work I cover are extremely talented people! The original mods are always a hard requirement.
  
  
**NORDWAR UA / SENTINEL**By [NordwarUA](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/NordwarUA?gameId=1704)﻿
  
  
As of this moment, these textures are not yet included into sentinel. If you use Sentinel and wish to use my versions of these textures, install these options and load my mod after Sentinel. If/when these textures are integrated into a future update of Sentinel, I will update this message.
  
  
I have tested these with Realistic Armors and Sentinel - an equipment overhaul. Should work with any other mods using these assets, as long as the author did not change the file paths
