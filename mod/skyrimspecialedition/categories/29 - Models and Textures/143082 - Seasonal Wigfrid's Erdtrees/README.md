DESCRIPTION
  
*Traverse the Ulvenwald* is one of my favorite tree mods, and my choice for a seasonal setup, however it does not include a gildergreen replacer. The lovely *Wigfrid's Erdtrees and Gildergreen* fits naturally with Ulvenwald, but does not have a seasonal version, so this is where this mod comes in!
  
  
A massive thank you to Wigfrid for creating so many wonderful tree mods and giving me the permissions to upload this!
  
  
FEATURES 
  
Seasonal swaps for both the Gildergreen replacer as well as the standalone Erdtrees
  
Compatibility patch to make those 2 modules work together (specifically the V2 version)
  
Optional non-emissive variants of the trees
  
Replacer version that does not require Seasons
  
  
INSTALLATION
  
If you want both the Erdtrees in the Rift as well as the Gildergreen/Eldergleam replacers then you need to do the following:
  
  
1. Install Ulvenwald Series - Erdtree GG Replacer
  
2. Install Ulvenwald Series - V2 - Erdtrees of Skyrim (make sure it overwrites the previous file)
  
3. Install this mod and select the Compatibility Patch in the FOMOD
