[left]﻿I didn't quite dig the mead models in Vanilla, so I decided to create new ones, Modeled them in Blender. Had a bit of a tussle with
  
that glass shader stuff. Still wrapping my head around the basics of .nif and the Creation Kit. Soon, I'll toss in my own Cubemaps, once I
  
figure out how to make them Work in Nifskope, LOL.
  
  
The models might look different depending on your setup. I took the shots using Pi-Cho ENB + Azurite Weathers.
  
  
Animated version In optional Files
  
  
Esp flagged as Esl
  
  
**Future Plans:**
  
  

  
* ~~Mead with Juniper Berry~~

  
* ~~Argonian Ale~~
~~Cubemaps for shiny Glass~~
  
* ~~Empty Mead Bottle~~
~~Empty Ale Bottle~~
  
* ~~Dragon's Breath Mead~~
~~Ashfire Mead~~
  
* ~~Aminated Version ... (Maybe)~~

  
Compatibility
  
  
Survival Mode (AE) Compatibility Patch in Optional Files
  
  
Probably incompatible with mods that change bottle values.
  
  
The mod is complete, unless something bad happens (I hope not).
