**Missives - Unique Missive Boards**

  
  
This mod adds 4 unique missive boards to Falkreath, Dawnstar, Morthal and Winterhold. Each board is based on their respective COTN overhaul, though it does not need any COTN mods installed! They all work on their own and you can pick and choose which boards you want in your game!
  
  
FOMOD includes option for [Missives - Notes Retexture](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46201) meshes!
  
  
Now includes a variant of the Morthal board to match the textures from [Redbag's Morthal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34530)!
  
  
Also includes optional plugins to move some objects so they don't clip with the new boards! (All files in the downloads are ESL flagged!)
  
  
I tried my best with these meshes, I am very much a dummy still when it comes to meshes lol.
  
  
Requires [Missives](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17576) (duh)
  
  
Should work without any additional patches with any missives patches that move the missive board to different location!
