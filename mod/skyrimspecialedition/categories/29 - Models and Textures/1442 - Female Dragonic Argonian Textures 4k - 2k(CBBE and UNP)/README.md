[font=Courier New]Notes about the mod[/font]   
   
CBBE and UNP
  
Seams has been mostly fixed (Feet aren't 100% seamless)
  
Specular maps hasn't been changed from Vanilla. I'll probably change that later
  
4k body/head/hands and 2k body and 1k head/hands choices for resolution
  
   
I always saw how Argonians didn't really have much of a choice when it comes to varied textures. So I decided to make my own and well, this was the result. By no means am I a professional texture artist. I'm pretty much some dude that has a lot of spare time, aside from work.
  
   
   

**If you want to use my textures in a mod of yours as a reference or base,
  
feel free to do so. But make sure to contact and credit me if you use my work.**

[font=Courier New]FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions)[/font]   
   
Q. “Are you making a male version”
  
   
A. The male version has been made already.
  
*http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1443/?*   
   
   
Q. “My Textures have gaping seams, why is that?”
  
   
A. Wrong body. I made these textures specifically for CBBE and UNP. If you have gaping seams around the waist/butt then you are using the wrong body for the texture mod. The only seams might be occurring on the feet, which I’ll fix later.
  
   
   
   
Q. “What ENB are you using?”
  
   
A. A tweaked version of Kountervibe.
  
   
   
   
Q. “Will you make a version with nipples?”
  
   
A. I could? I didn’t really see the point of it while I was making the textures.
  
 ***EDIT: Clearing this up since people seem to be confused in the comments section.
  
   
I never said I was NOT going to make them.
  
I never said I thought they were unimmersive.
  
All I said is that I didn't see a point while I was making the textures, meaning I wasn't really thinking about it.
  
   
I CAN make the textures for it but if people want to keep complaining that I don't have them then go ahead and make them yourself.***
