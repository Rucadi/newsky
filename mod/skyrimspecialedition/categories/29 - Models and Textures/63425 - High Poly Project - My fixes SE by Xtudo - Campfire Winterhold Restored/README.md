High Poly Project - My fixes SE-AE
  
by Xtudo**
  
**Description**
  
**Some fixes I did for my Skyrim for the awesome (must have!) High Poly Project mod by LucidAPs.**
  
  

  
* Fixed the bloody, ashen and snowy chopping blocks.
Snow texture for the snowy firewoods.
  
* Vanilla and Campfire options.
2K optimized optional textures.
  
* Sharpened the firewoods normal map textures (looks a bit more real now).
The original "HPP - FirewoodSnow.esp" and "HPP - FirewoodSnow Campfire.esp" files aren't required anymore.
  
* ﻿﻿Horn Candle Table texture seam fix. Less saturated candle horns, with less shinny metal supports. Added candles' wicks.
Dawnguard DLC Blood Barrels patch.
  
* Meal Barrels - Proper normal maps fix and optimized textures patch.
HPP version for the Firebrand Wine and Spice Wine models (thanks to MischiefBrew0). Now with my improved cork texture version.
  
* Patch for the Poisoned Apples added by the Creation Rare Curios.
Fixes and tweaks for the hay, with 2K HD textures.
  
* Fixes and tweaks for the Riften 3D Leaves.
Fixes to the mammoth skulls.
  
* Added the missing animated chopped wood texture.
Added the missing chopped wood being carried for NPCs.
  
* Several fixes to the Raw Beed, collision, normal maps and lighting.
Works for both SE and AE.
  
* All plugins are ESL.
**Candles fixes - Smoking Candles NOT included in the AIO version.** Install this one too if you use it.
  
* **JK's Whiterun Outskirts - Apples** patch.
