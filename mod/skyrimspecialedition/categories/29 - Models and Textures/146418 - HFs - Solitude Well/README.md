# HFs - Solitude Well

This mod adds several decorative elements to Solitude's well, such as metal trellis, signs and a weathervane. I also completely replaced the roof of the well with my new model.
  
As for the base part of the well, it remains unchanged (vanilla), so it will be fully compatible with any retexture mod from your modlist.

[font=Georgia]**UPDATE 1.1**[/font]

  
ESL plugin that adds ivy to the well. This does not contain any meshes or textures, vanilla ivy is added by default. So it is **fully compatible** with any ivy replacer and/or retexture you use. No compatibility patches are needed for ivy mods from other authors. Just install and enjoy. ?

[font=Georgia]**Compatability:**[/font]

  
Should be **fully compatible** with any retextures mods.
  
  
**Not compatible**with mods that make any changes to the the swell.nif, included in this mod, even if it is a simple name or folder structure change. Not compatible with any other meshes replacers for **Solitude Well** (*swell.nif*).
  
  
Mesh and textures only, no ESP. So it absolutely safe to install/uninstall at mid-game (at any time).
  
  
I hope you will like it. Endorsement is very appreciate ?
