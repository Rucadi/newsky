Well, I'm just a texture apprentice. I love the roads of the North and have always made several versions of textures for my own use. However, I decided to publish this version. Landscape textures are a bit more complex to adjust the details, especially since I'm still a beginner. But I hope you like it. I intend to improve my work over time.
  
  
OBS:Friends, these are my first landscape textures. So remember, I'm a beginner!
