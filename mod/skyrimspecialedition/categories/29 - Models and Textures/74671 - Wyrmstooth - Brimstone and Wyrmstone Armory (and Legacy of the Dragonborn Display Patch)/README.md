**This is an updated version of  [Wyrmstooth - Tweaks and Enhancements SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56939)﻿ by AndrealphusVIII, as well as a new Legacy of the Dragonborn display patch! 
  
  
Since this is such a drastic overhaul, we decided to just co-author a new mod release  :)
  
  
Included are new unique models and textures for Brimstone armor (male and female) and weapons, with native support for WACCF, CCOR, Survival Mode, and Frostfall, as well as an optional MLU patch!  (those mods are not required). 
  
  
This mod also retains the work done by AndrealphusVIII****to add all the Brimstone and Wyrmstone Ore Veins back into the Wyrmstooth world, as well as adding some Brimstone and Wyrmstone armor and weapons to high-level Wyrmstooth leveled lists and bosses.**
