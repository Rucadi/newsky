This retexture covers all armors and weapons found in the free Creation Club addon: Saints and Seducers.
  
  
**WHAT IS INCLUDED?**
  
  
This retexture will cover all armors and weapons from this CC and include consistency retextures for many items added in the excellent mod: [Extended Cut Saints and Seducers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72772) by the ECSS Dev Group. I have also added patches for [Amber Refossilised](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51529) by Jelidity and [Believable weapons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37737) by Jg1.
  
  
  
  
**FOMOD OPTIONS**
  
  
Fomod lets you pick and choose what you want. 
  
  
Chest textures are 4k, everything else is 2k
  
  
Half-res version available in Optional files (chests are 2k, everything else 1k)
  
  
Low-res version also available in Optional Files (chests are 1k, everything else is 1k)
  
  
  
**BASE INSTALL**
  
  
**ARMORS**
  
  
Either install everything or pick and choose exactly what you want.
  
  
  
**AMBER ARMOR**
  
  
**Vanilla version**

Use this texture if you do not use amber refossilised. It will work with any bodyslide conversions without the need for patches.
  
  
**Amber Refossilised version**
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/W7YJd6W.jpeg)
  
[Amber refossilised](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51529)﻿ by jelidity adds an effect where the amber looks semi-transparent. It is difficult to see the difference in a screenshot, but is obvious in-game, especially when moving. I personally really like this effect and recommend using this mod. Load my retexture after Amber refossilised

WEAPONS
  
  
Either install everything or pick and choose exactly what you want. Each weapon set will let you pick between vanilla meshes and [believable weapons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37737) meshes. Amber weapons also have a patch for [amber refossilised](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51529)

SWORD OF JYGGALAG[/size]**
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/uRIB1nh.jpeg)
  
Retextures the sword of Jyggalag and adds a multi-layer parallax effect to make it match with Vicn's [Vigilant SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11849) greymarch items when using my [Vigilant Retexture.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45735)

[/left]**﻿CONSISTENCY PATCHES**
  
These are optional retextures for some of my favorite mods. All the original mods are required and while I took inspiration from the originals, none of these textures used any parts of the original textures found in these mods.

Dylora's Helmet
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/geXjLdu.jpeg)
  
  
This helmet does not use its own custom textures. It is the regular dark seducer helmet with a decal on top, hence why there is no option for it in my FOMOD. It is pictured here just to show what it looks like if you do install my dark seducer textures
