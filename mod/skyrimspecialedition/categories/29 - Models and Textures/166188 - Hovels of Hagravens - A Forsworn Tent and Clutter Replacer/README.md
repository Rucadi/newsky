# Hovels of Hagravens - A Forsworn Tent and Clutter Replacer
- Author: sothasimp

- Pluck eyeballs and sever skeever heads in the comfort of your humble hag hovel, stitched from the skins of your adversaries and weatherproofed to boot
  
  
- Shield secret rituals from the prying eyes of the Silver-Bloods with matching leather fences stretched, treated and authentically tattered for that rustic forsworn vibe
  
  
- Slit the throats of your sacrificial goats over hag-approved artisanal stone bowls engraved with eldritch incantations that may or may not translate to "Sothasimp wuz here"
  
  
TL;DR it's a replacer for hagraven/forsworn tents, fences, pointy sticks and blood bowls. Pairs well with [Better Hagraven Clutter](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/104704) by [FrankBlack](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/146320); mesh fixes from [Subdivide and Smooth - Hagraven](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77912) are already incorporated with permission from the inimitable [markuskarttunen1](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/7739953), I encourage you to throw an endorsement/kudos their way as well.
  
  
LMK if there are any incompatibilities or patches necessary and I will add them when I have time.
