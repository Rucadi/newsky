# Scaffolding Over Sovngarde - Collision Overhaul - Corrective Kinetics

Every time I pass thru that goddamn sovengarde bridge my character sort of jitters between the bones and it's awful especially on 1st person. I redid the collision and made it way more simple so you can just walk across like its made of finest asphalt.
  
  
**Pros:**
  
- You can pass through the bridge without getting stuck here or have your character jitter up half a meter there.
  
- Added collisions on some parts that didn't already have them.
  
- The collision still mimics the geometry of the bridge, just not as rigorously as vanilla.
  
  
**Cons:**- Your characters feet either hover above or sink in to the bones. This also happens on the vanilla model, but less so and the expense of making the walking simulation awful.
  
  
**Neutral points:**
  
- There's also a bit more leeway on the shorter bones so you don't accidentally get yeeted in to nether because you took a dump while your character was afking at a 3 degree slope and slowly rolled their way over the edge. This is actually a pro now that I think of it.
  
- FPS difference is negligible on the normal version. High poly version actually has a ridiculous amount of tris (141k) so that will have a hit. Sovengarde isn't a very GPU taxing place tho.
  
- High poly version also available since I am a 20 year old SMOOOOTHER and literally can't use blender without subdivision-smoothing whatever I'm working on.
  
  
**Install:**
  
- Whenever, wherever. Doesn't matter.
