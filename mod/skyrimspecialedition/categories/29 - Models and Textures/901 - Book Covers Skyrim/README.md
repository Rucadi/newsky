Book Covers Skyrim is a high quality retexture of all the readable books, journals, and notes in vanilla Skyrim and all three DLC. It gives each book and journal its own unique cover and adds many additional paper styles to the notes. Spell Tomes are included in the mod with optimised meshes and a replacement texture for each school. All spells of a given school share the same texture. The Treasure Maps have all been hand drawn and the rubbing of the Dragonstone is included too.
  
  
To help distinguish skill books from other books, they have had a star added to the spine of the book.

You don't need ask me for permission to use the contents of this mod for any reason. You have it.
  
  
You can add to, subtract from, alter, enhance, embellish, patch, improve to your hearts content. This is meant to be a starting point for others to improve on, not an end all be all mod. I only request ONE thing in return...
  
  
1) You acknowledge the work I've done, and the work of those that I have credited. Rome was not built in a day and neither are mods. We all stand on the shoulders of those who came before us. Give credit where it is due.
  
  
  
**BOOK COVERS SKYRIM - PHOTOSHOP SOURCE RELEASED**
  
  
I have been asked to provide access to the Photoshop source files for the Book Covers Skyrim textures so that a non-English language version of the textures for the mod can be created. I wanted to make this announcement to say that I give consent for the Photoshop source files to be used to prepare either non-English language versions of the covers, alternative covers, differently desaturated covers or even covers for entirely new books providing appropriate credit is given.
  
  
If you read about the [Cathedral View](http://wryemusings.com/Cathedral%20vs.%20Parlor.html) of modding, you will understand that at some point a modder has to let go of their mod and give permission for others to take the mod into places they cannot. With this in mind, I have uploaded the PSD files for the entire Book Covers Skyrim mod - Books, Journals and Notes. The whole lot. As an added extra I have included such fonts that were marked as Free but I would advise you to go to websites such as dafont.com and see what else they have that takes your fancy. There will be some Commercial fonts used for which you will have to find substitutes.
  
  
If you are thinking of producing non-English versions of the textures I would like to make you aware of the scale of the undertaking.
  
  
There are around 420 Books, 120 Journals and about 100 Notes. While many (about 75%) of the Books have the text as separate editable layers, the remainder do not. They will tend to be flat textures inherited from Book Jackets Oblivion and will require careful editing to make them convincing.
  
  
As well as the textures themselves, you would have to prepare new normal maps as well. The normal maps contain height and shininess information that is affected by the writing on the cover.
  
  
The Books and Journals have 1024x512 DXT1 textures for the Inventory and World views and 1024x512 DXT5 normal for the Inventory and 512x256 DTX5 normals for the World. The Notes have 1024x1024 DXT1 textures for the Inventory, 512x512 DXT1 textures for the World, 512x512 DXT5 normals for the Inventory and 256x256 DXT5 normals for the World.
  
  
Remember you will have to produce desaturated textures too. I used a -50 desaturation adjustment for the mod.
