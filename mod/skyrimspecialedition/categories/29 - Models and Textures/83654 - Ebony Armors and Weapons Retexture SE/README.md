This mod retextures the Ebony armor set, shield and weapons, CC Ebony Plate armor, CC Ebony Crossbow and CC Ebony staff. Also contains optional retextures Amidianborn's content addon's  Gilded and silvered ebony armors and weapons, Oblivion artifacts Pack's Armor of Amelion Brussef, Knight of Chorrol Armor, shield and sword and the hands of the atrocnach, LOTD's honorblade of chorrol, NordwarUA's Ebony armor and weapons and Elsopa's ebony quiver. 
  
  
All items come in 3 color options: Black & silver, Black & gold and silver and white.
  
  
This mod also overwrites the Ebony Weapon meshes to give them the same cubemap and specular color as the armor. The vanilla meshes use a purple cubemap and blue specular while the armor use a grey cubemap and grey specular. Trying to reduce this issue by tweaking your textures is only a patch on this issue, which is why update 2.0 finally makes the weapons use the same cubemap (Chitin\_e\_ebony.dds) as the armor. 
  
  
The textures for the Ebony sets are based on [Cabal120's aMidianBorn Book of Silence](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35382)﻿. I used their normal maps as a base to create my retexture. 
  
  
I have tried to patch as many popular mods as I can. If I missed anything, please let me know in the comments or feel free to create the patch yourself and publish it on nexus (will provide instructions on how to create these mesh patches lower on this page. it is very simple to do).
  
  
Fomod lets you pick and choose what you want.

The lastest version of [amidianborn content addon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35390) added gilded and silvered ebony weapons. This option will apply my black and silver textures to the eboy weapons and my gilded ad silvered ebony textures to their respective weapons.

**CC EBONY BRAWLER'S FISTS**
  
  
This option simply changes the texture paths on these gloves so they use the same textures as the ebony armor, instead of duplicates of vanilla textures
  
  
  
**FEMALE VANILLA EBONY GAUTLET MESH FIX
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/isg9Ogq.png)**
  
  
In vanilla (and USSEP), the vanilla female ebony gauntlet have a flat grey vertex color applied to the whole mesh, making it darker. Other mods / bodyslides may fix this, but if your gauntlets look darker than the rest of the set, you can install this. In the screenshot above, both the before and after use my new textures, only the meshes change.

**AMIDIANBORN CONTENT ADDON CUBEMAP CHANGE ESP-FE**
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/dtOwBqD.png)
  
  
  
Amidianborn Content addon and the LITE version use a custom cubemap for both the silvered ebony and gilded ebony sets. I personally find the silvered ebony cubemaps works really well with my style of textures, but I personally do not like the one used for the gilded ebony armor. I prefer using the same cubemap as the vanilla ebony armor (chitin\_e\_ebony.dds). For this reason, I have created simple plugins to make this change. These 2 esp are flagged as ESL and only tweak the gilded ebony texture sets, so there should not be any compatibility issues with other patches or tweaks to the content addon. Normal AMB addon and LITE version are included.
  
In the screenshot above, both before and after uses my new textures, only the cubemap is changed.
  
  
The LITE version of the addon does not need this.
  
  
**WEAPONS MESH PATCHES**
  
  
While the ebony armor uses a grey cubemap and grey specular, the ebony weapons use a purple cubemap and blue specular. Because of this, they can ever truly match with each other. I pre-2.0 versions of this retexture, I "fixed" this by replacing the cubemap the weapons use (chitin\_e.dds) with a great cubemap, which is the same thing aMidianborn Book of Silence does. I feel like this was the wrong way to solve this issue because other items use this purple cubemap and it also does not fix the blue specular. So I got rid of my cubemap changes and applied the changes directly on the weapon meshes. I basically copied the settings from the armor:
  
  
**Specular color**: #8d989f
  
**Cubemap**: textures\cubemaps\Chitin\_e\_ebony.dds
  
**Environment Map Scale**: 0.8
  
  
In the FOMOD, please select which weapon meshes you use. I have tried providing patches for all the popular weapon meshes mods. If you use a weapon mesh that is not patched, it will look more purple than other ebony weapons but will not be "broken".

AMB ADDON - GILDED WEAPONS CUBEMAP CHANGES

  
  
Same as the weapon mesh patches above, if you selected the AMB Addon weapons on page 1 of the fomod, the option here will let you overwrite those meshes to use the same cubemap as the regular ebony weapons. You can also skip this step, if you prefer using the AMB addon custom cubemap.
  
  
  

CONSISTENCY PATCHES

  
  
These are optional retextures for some of my favorite mods. All the original mods are required and while I took inspiration from the originals, none of these textures used any parts of the original textures found in these mods.
