Hello and welcome to my modpage!
  
  
I hereby present you... mudcrab textures. Because why not.
  
Wanted to 'nice-ify' an [armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65057) mod, and the results came out pretty darn okay so why not share eh?﻿
  
  
Comes in 2 versions and 2 resolutions to choose from, 8k and 4k. 
  
Mudcrabs can be quite big creatures, so the original didn't cut it in my opinion.
  
The 'normal' editions have the same colors as the original Skyrim textures. And eyes.
  
The 'humanoid' editions have a slight pinkish skin-tone. And eyes. And teeth. And I hate that.
  
Suffer with me.
  
  
All versions touch the following files: 
  
mudcrab.dds, mudcrab\_m.dds and mudcrab\_n.dds
  
  
Requirements:
  
[Skyrim](https://store.steampowered.com/app/72850/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim/) and probably some mod manager.
  
  
Anyway, the screenshots speak for themselves.
  
  
 EDIT 23-06-2022
  
Added Chitin, the ingredient. 
  
And Leg. Yay!
  
Enjoy!﻿
