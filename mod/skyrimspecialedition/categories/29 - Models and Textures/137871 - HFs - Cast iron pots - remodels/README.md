Compatability:

[/font]**
  
Should be fully compatible with anything except mods from other author's that modify cast iron pots.
  
  
Not compatible with mods that make any changes to the*cast iron pots* NIFs, included in this mod, even if it is a simple name or folder structure change. Not compatible with any other *cast iron pots* mesh replacers or retextures.
  
  
Only meshes & textures, no ESP, no scripts. So it safe to install/uninstall at mid-game (at any time).
  
  
I hope you will like it. Endorsement is very appreciate ?
