[/color][/color][/color][/color]**[/font][/size]The Major Cities Mesh Overhaul mod is a collection of many mesh fixes and improvements for the main cities of Skyrim. The goal was to polish and fix the existing exterior objects and buildings in and also around major cities. The following cities have received overhauled meshes: Whiterun, Riften, Solitude, Windhelm, Farmhouses, Skaal Village. There is also an optional ESP, which adds some decorative moss and water splash effects to Whiterun.
  
  

Also availble for Xbox One on [Bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net/de/mods/skyrim/mod-detail/4251655).

In general the mod without ESP is compatible with any city overhaul mod, since it does only change the meshes and not the placement of world objects.
  
However there are some incompatibilities with mods, that also change the meshes of city buildings, terrain or objects.
  
If you are using [ELFX](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2424/?) Exteriors, install [ELFX](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2424/?) first and then overwrite with my mod.
  
You can safely overwrite [Skyrim particle patch for ENB](http://www.enbseries.enbdev.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=1499&sid=0dafd2624dea6bc06b4921d47983107b). 
  
If you use the [Whiterun Mesh Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48120) or [Solitude Mesh Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29621) mods by [MrNeverLost](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/1892037), also install those first and then overwrite when prompted.
  
If you want to use [3D Solitude Market Trellis](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42472) by [RedBag](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/777131), install my mod first and then overwrite the meshes.
  
If you use city retexture mods like [High Fantasy Whiterun](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51749), you will have to install my mod first and then overwrite it with the texture mod.
  
You should install [Water in Wells](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57268)  after this mod. Does only affect the well in Whiterun.
  
Also install [Skyrim Landscape and Water Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26138) after my mod, if you want to use it.
  
If you use [Simplicity of Snow](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56235) install my mod first and then overwrite. This will only affect the stablekit meshes.
  
If you use [Assorted mesh fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32117) install my mod first and then overwrite.
  
If you use [Whiterun Objects SMIMed](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69125?tab=images), please install all files after my mod.
