What this mod does:[/font]**This mod replaces and expands the Skyrim food system using 250+ photoscanned food models. 
  
The model used are high poly. The polycount goes from less than 300 to 4k depending on the model, and a real few go higher. Average polygons is about 2~2.5k polygons. This can get updated to be less high poly in future plans.
  
  
The mod currently expands the following food categories:
  

  
* Vegetables
Fruits
  
* Meat
Bakery
  
* cereals
ingredients
  

  
This mod also comes with world integration: the new items can be found in containers, in places, in vendor's inventories and on plants. New recipes have also been added. The price and availability of some food items will depend on the region, the weather, the faction and the access to the commercial roads.**Skyrim Food Expansion comes with a suite of new icons designed for use with [Constructible Object Custom Keyword System](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81409) and [Inventory Interface Information Injector](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85702). Since the mod will still function without these icons, these mods should be considered soft requirements.

DON'T FORGET IT'S STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS AND IT MIGHT NOT BE PERFECT IN THE FIRST VERSIONS**
