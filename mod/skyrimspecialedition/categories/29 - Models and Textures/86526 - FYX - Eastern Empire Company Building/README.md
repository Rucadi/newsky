Hi!
  
When I went to the docks of Solitude and entered this building, I wondered why Bethesda placed fake windows when this mesh is "Open". So I wanted to fix that.
  
Then I saw some objects placed on the "terrace" and I thought how a player or an NPC could climb on it. So I logically opened the access to it.
  
  
- Add access to the "terrace"
  
- Open fakes "Windows"
  
- Fix floating bar and bad placement
  
- Fix floating roof
  
- Fix some UV's
  
- Fix the holes on each side of the central beam
  
- Fix the offsets from the top of the rear left wall
  
- Fix rear right corner offset
  
- Fix UV map of the rear right wood beam
  
- Fix the foating building *(Already fixed in SMIM, but if you don't use it you can have this correction with this FYX - (A) )*- Rework, as you can imagine, the collition. This fixes the bug that blocked the player a bit on the last wooden step of the Vanilla staircase.
  
  
Enjoy !

When you see the screenshots you will probably ask me why I didn't place the entrance of the terrace in the center. Simply as I didn't want ESP it's the only place that was compatible with a lot of mods that modify the docks of Solitude. And the distance gave me enough space to place the stairs. ;)
