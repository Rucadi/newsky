# Glow of the Gildergreen

Originally this idea was inspired by the holographic falling sakura petals in Cyberpunk 2077, and expanded upon by the Sussur tree from Baldur's Gate 3, but I hesitated for a long time to make it. 
  
  
  
***[font=Georgia]What's in the mod[/font]***
  
At the moment the glow is in two variants - pink (default) and light blue. Glow is added to all stages of tree growth, including sapling, falling petals and tree in Eldergleam Sanctuary. The ENB Light effect is more noticeable at sunset, at night and at sunrise. Also, the glow of the foliage is slightly visible in certain weather conditions during the day.
  
  
***[font=Georgia]Requirements & Recommended mods[/font]***[ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/games/skyrimspecialedition/mods?categoryName=Presets+-+ENB+and+ReShade) or [Community Shaders](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86492) with [[color=#ead1dc]Light Limit Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99548)[/color] addon - without one of this ENB light won't work.
  
[The Gildergreen Grows](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/147742) - highly recommended. In addition to the tree growing, this mod adds falling petals (which you can see in my screenshots), and also adds a bit of
  
immersion, allowing you to water the sapling. ***Hard requirement*** for NotWL version. **[font=Georgia]
  
Not compatible [/font]**with other Gildergreen replacers.

**[font=Georgia]*How to install*[/font]**
  
Choose only one version of the main file. Install throught your favorite Mod Manager or manually (just extract the archive to your game's Data folder) and overwrite everything if asked.***[font=Georgia]Future plans[/font]***[font=Georgia] [/font]
  
  
I plan to add more colors, especially if there is a request for a specific one.
  
Patches for other replacers are possible if the authors of those mods give me permission and if there will be requests for them.
