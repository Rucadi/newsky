I moved the quiver a little farther so it doesnt clip as the vanilla one with weapons or cloaks. (not perfect but way better!)
  
No polygon bloat, very close to vanilla (it means it wont strain the game engine)
  
**Compatible with Belt-Fastened Quivers!**
  
**Optional 1k Scabbards!**
  
**ENB is *Rudy ENB for Obsidian Weathers***
  
  
  
...will I ever have a mod of the month?
