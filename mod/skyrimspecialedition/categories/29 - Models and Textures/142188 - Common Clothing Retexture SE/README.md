The goal of this retexture was to improve skyrim's clothing, while keeping its original designs. I took a few artistic liberties here and there, such as making clothes worn by wealthier NPCs more colorful and making civilian/workers clothes dirtier and less colorful, for example. But overall, my goal was for people to be able to look at my retextures and still recognize the original designs. I know the term "vanilla +" can mean so many things, but this is what it means to me. Making skyrim look better while still looking like skyrim.
  
  
  
This is the biggest project I have ever worked on and have put hundreds of hours into it. I truly hope you will all enjoy the result
  
**WHAT IS INCLUDED?**
  
  
This mod covers all vanilla clothing (except the jester set which will be coming in an update to my dark brotherhood retexture), DLC clothing and clothing from the following CCs: Winter, Lords mail (green and yellow redguard variants), Dead man's dread and Fishing. I also included a retexture of the  swords from CC dead man's dread, simply for ease of download.

**SKAAL** OPTIONS
  
  
[left]**WITH SNOW (VANILLA STYLE)**
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/EZWfs4U.png)
  
Like the vanilla version, this version has snow baked on the textures. This will help the skaal NPCs blend better in their environment but may look awkward if you plan to wear this outfit in non-snowy areas.
  
  
Use this version if you do not plan on wearing the skaal outfit or plan on only wearing it in snowy areas
  
  
  
**NO SNOW**
  
  
Removes the snow on the texture. use this version if you plan to use this outfit in non-snowy area
  
  
**JARLS - SLEEVES ADDON
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/ZZG34BX.png)**
  
Adds an option to add sleeves to this jarl's clothing. The female version already has sleeves, this will only change the male's set. Armor & clothing extension also adds an extra sleeved variants, which I offer a consistency patch for. So I only recommend using this option if you do not use ACE. Optional ESP-FE to add proper 1st person meshes
  
[/left]**CONSISTENCY PATCHES**
  
These are optional retextures for some of my favorite mods. All the original mods are required and while I took inspiration from the originals, none of these textures used any parts of the original textures found in these mods. 
  
**ARMOR AND CLOTHING EXTENSION
  
By Kryptopyr and Gamwich**
  
  
﻿While I took great inspiration from the original textures made by Gamwich, I did not use any of them in any shape or form during the making of this mod, outside of looking at them for inspiration. My goal was not to improve them, as they are already incredibly well done, but to redesign these clothes to fit better with my own style. Please view these as an alternative to the original work and not an attempt at objectively "improving it".
