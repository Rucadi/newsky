Disclaimer: This is not and almost definitely never will be a full PBR retexture of LOTD; that would be a huge undertaking that I absolutely don't have the time, energy or skill to do. Right now I'm just trying to cover a bunch of museum architecture stuff that was standing out next to all the vanilla assets that have already been PBR'd, but I felt like there was enough done to be worth uploading it while I keep working.
  
  
**Currently covered:**

  
* A bunch of floor/ceiling/wall textures in the museum & safehouse
Metal railing
  
* Fabric in the back of display cases
The marble statues in the Hall of Heroes
  
* Stone statues that show up outside and I think a couple of other places
Plaques

**Installation:**

  
* Install normally with your mod manager of choice
