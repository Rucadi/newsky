This mod adds morphs for the Argonian tails, so that the weight of the tail will match the body weight.
  
  
It always bothered me that the Argonian tails were constantly skinny, even if the character's body was bulky. The only mod I've seen that addresses this is Bigger Argonian Tails, which increases the size of the tails on ALL Argonians. However, I always felt that the thicker tails looked too big on smaller characters.
  
  
This mod instead uses the skinny vanilla tail as the smallest morph, and adds a new mesh that is roughly the same size as Bigger Argonian Tails for the largest morph. Middle weight Argonians will then have a tail that is right in between the size of these two. The morphs work for NPCs as well as the player character.

This mod will conflict with anything that replaces the Argonian tail mesh. Any tail armor mods can technically be used alongside this mod, but if they don't have morph meshes, they will not properly reflect the character's weight.
  
  
This mod is compatible with texture and animation replacers.
  
  
This mod also has options to move the tail position up: Tails Higher and Tails Slightly Higher. If you want to use these, download the main file and then overwrite the models with the version you want. If you want only the female tails to be higher but not the male, then only replace the female meshes.
