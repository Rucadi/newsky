*EDIT*
  
  
  
Back to modding for a bit and needed to update this. Pics will be a while since tedious to path everything to new and old textures while making sure the model stays in place when I take it.
  
  
  
Updated the Enhanced textures which took a long while since PC is getting slower. 
  
  
  
Enjoy the update!
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
*This is a mod I love to use all the time so decided to do something special and because I reached almost 10,000 downloads on all the texture mods I have posted.*
  
  
I have spent 2 days into developing a new texture which I will call "Enhanced" mostly since I have that in the title so why not have it as a texture option.
  
  
Enhanced textures takes bit more time to create due to me having to run textures twice after cleaning it.
  
  
The enhanced textures are slightly darker while having much more detail compared to the regular cleaned and upscaled textures.
  
  
After this post I shall be adding the Enhanced textures to Enai's mods that has model textures but will be a while and when I do that I will fix the BSA of the mods because its better to do it all at once
  
  
Major thanks to Myst42 the creator of Undeath - The Ascension for allowing me to use some lich textures that were missing in Classical Lichdom for this texture mod. Without them, your Black Lich and all bump maps would remain uncleaned and not enhanced which will look messed up with the Lich models so again huge thanks to them.
  
  
  
  
No Bsa because the BSA in Classical Lichdom contains both Meshes and Textures so making a Texture BSA could screw up the mod's original BSA.
  
  
  
To use this mod of course you need   [Undeath - Classical Lichdom](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40802?tab=files)﻿﻿
  
  
  
Comes with 2k version which textures are 2048.
  
  
2X is all textures are increased by twice the normal size with twice the quality so 4k
  
  
4x is same as 2x but it's four times everything.
  
  
  
Only Lich textures are upscaled because Worm staff only effects one bone which has a bandage but the skeleton texture is really low res which is strange because its the same size as a vanilla skeleton texture aka 4k. I tried to fix up texture with upscale but just made it worse.
  
  
  
  
  
*As of now all Gradients and Effects will always be the cleaned textures and never upscaled due to bad resolution when upscaled.*
  
  
  
  
Some End notes here.
  
  
I actually waited for Classical Lichdom since 2018 on Reddit when I saw it posted and kept checking updates until no more updates were made on the document which depressed me because I thought the mod idea was scrapped.
  
  
On September of last year I was checking nexus and that Classical Lichdom was uploaded. I was so hyped because I thought the mod was gone forever but here it was. I could not wait to play it....until I found out Odyssey of the Dragonborn was being made and I did not want to start all over once that mod releases because I always play 1 character which I never restart.
  
  
So until Odyssey is released I am making sure my Skyrim Mod list is the best in quality and Gameplay while also trying to get new parts for the PC.
  
Ironically Odyssey and Legacy of the DragonBorn is what got me started cleaning and enhancing textures.
  
  
Because of that, I shall wait until Odyssey is released and I will keep cleaning and enhancing textures I use while I try get new PC parts and if a mod author gives me permission to release it then I shall upload it to nexus....unless they want to upload it themselves then I just give it to them the textures like I did with [Oblivion Artifacts](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10644?tab=description)﻿ texture pack I did so go check that out.
  
  
Hope people love these textures on their Lich because until Odyssey comes I can't be a Lich.
  
  
Skeleton texture that is being used is from [aMidianBorn Book of Silence SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35382)﻿
