Not perfect by any stretch of imagination but maybe someone will find this a good fit for their game.
  
  
**PERFORMANCE**
  
The new models have more geometry compared to vanilla but it shouldn't make a massive difference since these assets appear in limited numbers. However, it's possible that there's a performance hit if you're already near the draw call limit as Whiterun outskirts can get pretty crowded when using many mods that affect the area.
  
  
TL;DR: Usually not a problem but good to keep in mind.
  
  
Installer offers a choice between 2k and 4k resolution textures to save VRAM or prioritize texture details.
  
  
**COMPATIBILITY**
  
The new stonewalls match vanilla proportions so they should work as a direct replacement. No plugin needed.
  
  
Thanks to anyone using and endorsing my mod.
