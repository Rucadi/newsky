**Description**
  
  
Complex Material is a new way to introduce more complex glossy-spec based shading and parallax.
  
The environment map mask texture was repurposed to make use of each channel, to include any necessary maps for glossy spec shading.
  
  
PBR (Physically Based Rendering) is an approach for materials and rendering that creates more accurate and predictable results than vanilla rendering techniques, and works very well with dynamic lighting conditions (like time-of-day).
  
  
This addon will ensures that materials like metal, wood, and fabric behave consistently under different lighting conditions. Improving the textures with reflectiveness, roughness, metallic shade, and parallax.
