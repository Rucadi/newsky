Introduction

[/font][font=Verdana]Vanilla Pine branches just unnatural. So here is my take on them. I made these textures from photos of real Spruce branches (Skyrim ''Pines'' is definitely Spruces for me). I believe that they are more realistic and quality.
  
  
I would call new version a truly second generation. I've probably doubled my efforts compared to first release. The key pros are:

  
* Only best assets from first one were used and few more were made by me. All assets were cutted manually, not by soft as earlier (and contained inaccuracies and noise).
I increased scale of branches elements. This improved quality a lot that important for most used 4K version.
  
* Dead branches totally redone as well. They looked really bad and thin in first version. I always wanted to remake them.
Significantly better compression from my last mods is used comparing the first one version.
  
* Careful color correction, not like in "green" 3.0 version.
Tried to reduce "flat" places in composition. The first version had couple such annoying things. Wanted more carved look.
  
* 16K was an upscale, now it is native resolution of textures (8K was native earlier). Honestly, 8K improved so much and 16K probably necessary no more, but I will not take opportunity to use it.
2K version added. Surely, I can't recommend to use it, but I really want to make this affordable for everyone.
  

  
Don't forget to take a look on [Pine Shrubs Redone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46183) - best companion for these branches, designed to be consistent with them.
  
  
Screenshots displays 8K version and made without any ENB, weather or lighting mods.

[font=Verdana]Q&A[/font]

  

  
* [font=Verdana]Q: I see cutted part of branch, you've made some mistake.[/font]

       [font=Verdana] A: Sadly, there are numerous inaccuracies, when different tree meshes cut bigger or lesser part of texture. There is only one way to solve it: significantly decrease scale of branch, that is not worth to do from our side or our Pines become thinner. If you see some kind of such innacuracy, try to check this place with vanilla branches texture and you most likely will see the same.[/font]

* [font=Verdana]Q: For what kind of reason you was so stupid to delete billboards from downloads?[/font]

        [font=Verdana]A: With DynDOLOD 3 we don't need it. Make and use your personal ones.
  
[/font]

  
[font=Verdana]
  
[/font]* [font=Verdana]Q: Color is terrible with my ENB! You're hopeless...[/font]

[font=Verdana]     A: Color was setted in vanilla game whithout any ENB or weather mod. And I can't make it suitable for every one of them. Turn your ENB off and you will see how actually it looks. There is full set of uncompressed files in downloads section for those, who want to try to customize colors. 
  
  
[/font]

  
* [font=Verdana]Q: Is this compatible with mod X?[/font]

[font=Verdana]     A: I don't know, really. Read documentation of your tree mod. Some of them use vanilla branches, others - not.
  
  
[/font]

  
* [font=Verdana]Q: My snowy Pine from DLCs looks weird![/font]

[font=Verdana]     A: Yes, that tree uses current snow texture therefore mismatch with branches is very possible. Obviously, it's impossible to match all kinds of snow from Nexus with one texture.[/font]

* [size=3]Q: Oldrim compatibility?
  
     A: No. BC7 is used.
