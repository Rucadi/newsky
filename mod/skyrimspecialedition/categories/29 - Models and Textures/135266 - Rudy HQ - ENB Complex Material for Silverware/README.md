ENB Complex Material for silverware (for gold too, if anyone asked) well, and for that used by vampires. An alternative version that turns silver into gold, for those who love luxury.
  
  
For people who love the latest technological innovations such as Parallax, Metalness and Dynamic Cubemaps.

**Reminder:**
  

  
  
Don't expect everything to be reflected in Dynamic Cubemaps. Outdoors the sky and LoD are reflected, indoors pretty much everything except transparent things, so special effects like fire etc. are not reflected.
  
  
Well, and remember that first the camera has to see it and only then it can be reflected.
  
  
In “enbseries.ini” you must have these effects enabled:
  
  
EnableComplexParallax=true
  
EnableComplexParallaxShadows=true
  
EnableComplexMaterial=true
  
EnableDynamicCubemap=true
  
  
If you set “IgnoreInventory=false” in “enblocal.ini”, there will be active ENB effects, but without Cubemap, so these items won't look very pretty.
  

  
  
Remember that this modification requires the use of ENB to work properly.
  
  
In the **optional files** there is a version that turns all silver into gold. I didn't make an installer, because it's probably more handy to install both versions and just switch between them, depending on your preference. It's just a mesh and texture replacement, it shouldn't affect gameplay in any way and the change can be made safely at any time.
  
  
This mod is based on textures from “Rudy HQ - Miscellaneous SE” but is completely independent. If you use the mentioned mod, just give this one more priority. The textures and shaders in the meshes are changed.
