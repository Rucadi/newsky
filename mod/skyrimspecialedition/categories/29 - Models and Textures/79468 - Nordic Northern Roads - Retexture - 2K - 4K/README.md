**Description:**JPSteel2's [Northern Roads](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77530) is a wonderful mod that overhauls Skyrim's landscape to be something more memorable and interesting. The mod comes with custom assets, some of which don't blend that well with my setup. So, I created this retexture from scratch to get the original feeling of the mod using photorealistic assets from Quixel. None of the textures is simply Quixel asset port. Each of them has been carefully mixed and tuned to be as faithful to the original mod as possible. All of the textures in landscape, architecture, and clutter folders are covered except the barrel textures.
  
  
**Requirement:**[Northern Roads](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77530)[ENB Series](http://enbdev.com/) or [Complex Parallax Materials](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/95134) for parallax effect
  
[Terrain Helper for ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/143149) (Normal parallax version also available)
  
  
**Recommendation:**[Witchy Wilderness - Modular Grass Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/134287): My choice of grass mod. Newer screenshots were taken with it.

As well as making the alpha completely black in some cases.*
