**Oft overlooked and even more often requested, I'm proud to present the latest release in the Skyland library, High Hrothgar. With all new 2k and 4k HD textures generated from 3D scanned materials in BC7 compression.**[size=3][/size]
  
**2.0 Update:**
  
The previous version of Skyland High Hrothgar was not up to my standards and was treated as more of a "get it done" in stead of doing it right at the level that I try to achieve when making mods. Here is now Skyland High Hrothgar 2.0. All the stone textures and normal maps have been remade from scratch. Top to bottom. The doors are the only thing that remain the same.
  
  
**Enjoy!
