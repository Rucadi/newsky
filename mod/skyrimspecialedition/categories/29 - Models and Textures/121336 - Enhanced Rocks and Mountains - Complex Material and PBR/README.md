**Enhanced Rocks and [size=6]Mountains**[/size]

  
*[CaptainCockerel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/2171250) gave me the honor of taking care of ERM. So without further ado, here's the description from the original page.*
  
  
  
**Geometry Enhanced**
  
  
Rocks now look more three-dimensional, which gives them a more realistic presence in the game world. The mod also improves the way light and shadows interact with the rocks, adding more depth and realism to the game's lighting effects.
  
  
**Blending Enhanced**
  
  
One of the standout features of this mod is the additional and upgraded mountain rock rubble, which expertly hides hard texture borders and makes the rocks and terrain look much more natural, blended, and lifelike.
  
  
Wet rocks also blend in better with their surroundings. They have been very carefully lightened to not look too overly dark compared to their drier counterparts.
  
  
**Terrain Enhanced**
  
  
A lot of rock assets have terrain built straight into them. Other mods simply keep the borders of the rock angular on these files so they don't have to rework the terrain. ERM totally rebuilds most of the dirt, snow, grass and other walkable terrain pieces contained in these assets. This means everything looks much more consistently detailed.
  
  
**Perfomance Enhanced**
  
  
Huh? Is this mod going to increase my frames? Not technically, but all of my mods have performance in mind. There's a thing called going too far after all! The models are painstakingly checked for any errors before export, geometry is eye-balled to check to see if it's just about smooth enough, and detail is optimised to remove any extra polygons where they aren't really needed.
  
  
**Collision Enhanced**
  
  
Mountains are large overbearing objects, so collision has been totally regenerated for such assets. Plant your feet down and take a few strides knowing that the huge slab of rock you are walking on is more accurate to your steps while also still being performant.
  
  
**Shading Enhanced**
  
  
Say goodbye to fakery! ERM removes any colours directly painted onto the model, so you know your textures will look as they should. On top of this, ambient shadowing has been raytraced straight onto each rock surface offline to give a bit more punch and realism to crevices.
  
  
Note: This will make the rocks a bit lighter than the base game, but this is easily solved by grabbing a slightly darker rock retexture, like the optional ERM rock texture pack.
  
  
**Compatibility Enhanced**
  
  
Compatible with any texture mod that uses a square texture like the vanilla game. Examples: 2048x2048 (2K), 4096x4096 (4K), 8096x8096 (8K). Just install with a mod manager and forget about it! Simple.
  
  
**Parallax Enhanced**
  
  
ERM has special designated areas to remove the snow where the new material blending feature (see Blending Enhanced above) is seen. By default, you wouldn't be able to see the blending on parallax-enabled rocks without these areas if they have a coat of snow. The mod goes above and beyond to make sure the visuals are consistent, whether you are using parallax or not.

A : Because in real life every surface has a level of reflectiveness.
