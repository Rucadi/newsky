This is a single texture mod, for the fallen leaves you can see in Riften. It was created with the Skyrim 3D Trees in mind, but i think it will look great with any kind of flora set up. It should blend nicely, especially with the amazing Noble rustic wood textures.
  
  
The leaves are in quite realistic scale and the ugly seams of the bethesda's terrible UV mapping will be almost invisible.
  
  
  
Resolutions available: 4096x4096 px , 2048 x 2048 px and 1024 x 1024 px
  
  
**Updated**: Vanilla meshes included so that they point to the corresponding normal maps
  
  
Hope you enjoy
