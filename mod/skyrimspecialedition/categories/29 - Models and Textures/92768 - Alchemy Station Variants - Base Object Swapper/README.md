# Alchemy Station Variants - Base Object Swapper
- Author: Pieter82
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

Alchemy Station Variants uses Base Object Swapper (BOS) to dynamically swap between four variants of the Alchemy Tables and four variants of the Mobile Alchemy Stations.
  
  
Each variant features high poly alembics with diverse clutter items and different colored fluids.
  
Clutter items consist of various Static Mesh Improvement Mod (SMIM) and Vanilla meshes.
  
The plugin is flagged as ESL.
  
  
Two options are provided for BOS implementation:
  

  
1. **Continuous Swap** - This version will randomly swap between meshes each time you enter a cell. The intent with this is that it will make it seem as though the same individual is brewing something different each time you visit them. The swap only happens on reentering a cell, so if you leave a building with an alchemy station inside, the station will not swap each time you exit and enter through the door, but only once you leave the world cell the building is in.
**Persistent Swap** - This version will randomly swap between meshes only once per game instance. Thus, if the Alchemy station in Arcadia's Cauldron (as an example) was set as "Station 1" the first time you entered, it will remain as "Station 1" for the rest of your playthrough. Ultimately you will see all the variations in your game, but the individual stations will not change again after the first time you encounter them.  
  

  
The meshes themselves come in two versions: with and without ENB.
  
Texture paths remain vanilla (except for the SMIM clutter) thus any vanilla based retexture of the Alchemy Stations will be compatible.     
  
  
If you are instead looking for a non BOS vanilla mesh replacer, higher poly, either with or without clutter, you can try [Higher Poly Vanilla Alchemy Stations](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/91114#)﻿.
  
  
Optional Files:
  
**Less Clutter:** These remove some of the clutter from the tables (mostly from the left hand "shelf") but retain the higher poly alembics, improved table legs, different colored fluids and the more out of the way clutter items. The intent is that this version will be more compatible with interior mods that adds clutter to the alchemy stations via it's plugin. This will help prevent clipping issues. When installing the add-on, please ensure you use the corresponding main file (a main file is still required) and have the add-on overwrite the main file.
  
  
**No Clutter:** These remove all the clutter from the tables but retain the higher poly alembics, improved table legs and different colored fluids. The intent is that this version will be most compatible with interior mods that adds clutter to the alchemy stations via it's plugin. This will eliminate clipping issues. When installing the add-on, please ensure you use the corresponding main file (a main file is still required) and have the add-on overwrite the main file. SMIM is not required for the "no clutter" versions.
  
  
**ElSopa Potions (Full Clutter):** These replace the vanilla potion bottle meshes (clutter items only) with the far superior ones from [ElSopa - Potions Redone](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80832).  This is also a "Full Clutter" version. When installing the add-on, please ensure you use the corresponding main file (a main file is still required) and have the add-on overwrite the main file. The original mod is a hard requirement as I include no textures with my files. 
  
Thank you to ElSopa for allowing me to make use of their assets.  
  
  
**xXAwesome\_PotionsXx (Full Clutter):** These replace the vanilla potion bottle meshes (clutter items only) with the ones from [xXAwesome\_PotionsXx](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5077).  This is also a "Full Clutter" version. When installing the add-on, please ensure you use the corresponding main file (a main file is still required) and have the add-on overwrite the main file. The original mod is a hard requirement as I include no textures with my files.

**Unified Potions (Full Clutter):** These replace the vanilla potion bottle meshes (clutter items only) with the ones from [Unified Potions](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/141226?tab=description)﻿.  This is also a "Full Clutter" version. When installing the add-on, please ensure you use the corresponding main file (a main file is still required) and have the add-on overwrite the main file. The original mod is a hard requirement as I include no textures with my files.

**Tamriel Alchemy (Full Clutter):** These replace the vanilla potion bottle meshes (clutter items only) with the ones from [Zerofrost's Tamriel Alchemy - New Drinks and Potions Replacer](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/163794).  This is also a "Full Clutter" version. When installing the add-on, please ensure you use the corresponding main file (a main file is still required) and have the add-on overwrite the main file. The original mod is a hard requirement as I include no textures with my files. 
  
Thank you to Zerofrost, Kreiste and Hexxagone for publishing their mod with open permissions.
  
  
**GlassTile Texture Replacer:** Myself and Skyking2020 have received reports that the PlainGlassTile retexture of [Bits & Bobs](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/95032) makes the glass of the alchemy station alembics of this mod very transparent, basically invisible. Skyking2020 was kind enough to make a custom PlainGlassTile retexture specifically for this mod. It looks fantastic and I cannot thank Skyking2020 enough for his effort and support.
  
If you use Bits & Bobs together with my mod, simply have the GlassTile Texture Replacer optional file overwrite Bits & Bobs. 
  
  
**Higher Poly Alchemy Table for Load Screen:** I removed the Load Screen mesh from the Main Files and added it as a separate download. This ensures compatibility with mods that make use of the load screen mesh like JK's Sleeping Giant Inn.
  
You only require this file if you would like the Alchemy Loading Screen to make use of my higher poly model and you are not making use of JK's mod or anything similar.
  
  
**Note:** The main files are the "Full Clutter" versions as seen in the screenshots.
