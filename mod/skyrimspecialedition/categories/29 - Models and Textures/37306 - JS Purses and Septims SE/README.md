**FAQ:**
  
  
1) What ENB do you use?
  
• A modified version of Aeon ENB
  
  
2) Can you make it this color & with polka dots?
  
• No! though a more dirty/beat-up version *may* be added later on.
  
  
3) Does this have compatibility issues with another coin-related mod?
  
• There is always potential for compatibility issues when creating brand new replacers, since many mods directly use vanilla assets. If you bring it to my attention, perhaps I can make a patch or you can contact the owner of the other mod you're using and see if they want to make a patch for this mod.
