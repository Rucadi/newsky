This mod is the ultimate rework of the game deers, elks, reindeers, whatever they are.
  
I am not the author of all the assets in the mod. This is a mashup of a couple of different mods from nexus, all of them with open permissions. I have used these assets, improved them and fixed some bugs.
  
 I have made this mod for myself and decided to upload it to nexus as well. If any author that I borrowed assets from will have any complaints, I will remove this mod from nexus.
  
Here's what was used:
  
  
[MM - REAL ELKS](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41929)﻿ by [rickard](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/1900193) - This mod is the source of textures for the creatures. I have improved them and fixed some bugs (see below).
  
[More Realistic Antlers for Male Elk by FrankBlack](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/103819)﻿ by [WillOhTheWisp](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/102078168) - This author put the amazing FrankBlack's antlers on the actual male elk. I have included his meshes in my mod.
  
[More Realistic Antlers for Female Elk by FrankBlack](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89680) by [WillOhTheWisp](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/102078168) - Same as above but for the female elk.
  
[Better-Looking Antlers for Reindeer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120151) by [demifish](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/4723962) - Different author, but same thing as above. They put much better looking antlers on a reindeer mesh. I have included the mesh in my mod.
  
[More Realistic Fur and Antlers for Elk Trophies](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89205) by [FrankBlack](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/146320) - This is the source of textures for elk antlers that WillOhTheWisp put on elks. I have improved these textures.
  
  
**[Macxhiin](https://forums.nexusmods.com/profile/97073623-macxhiin/)** also deserves a lot credit for bringing us [Fluffworks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56361).
  
  
I have also used the MM - REAL ELKS textures and the custom meshes with better antlers to create 2 variants of the White Stag that you can pick from. It can be a white reindeer just like in vanilla game or white elk that fits the creature better in my opinion.
  
The mod comes in 4K and 2K version in the form of an All-in-One FOMOD. You can also pick if you want fluffy meshes or regular meshes for the deers.
  
  
Few hours of work with these amazing assets resulted in a very satisfying all-in-one mod greatly improving the deers.
  
Some of the improvements that I made are:
  
  
Spoiler
  
Fixed weird nose color on elks in MM - REAL ELKS texture.

And some more minor fixes.
  
  
  
  
But that's not everything. There are some more mods that you really should use to futher improve your deers. I heavily recommend installing these:

[slightly Better Large Antlers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/103590)
  
[slightly Better Small Antlers and Deer Hide](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/83672)
  
[Better Pelts and Hides](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/87277)
  
[Better Hagraven Clutter](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/104704)
  
  
Enjoy!
