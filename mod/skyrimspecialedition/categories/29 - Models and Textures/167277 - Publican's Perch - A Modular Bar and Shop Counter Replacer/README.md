* ﻿Ply your wares and critique your clientele from behind a variety of classy counter sets for the perusing pleasure of your patrons

  

  
* ﻿Tend bar and/or get sloshed atop finely crafted fitments, with surfaces authentically scratched and stained as if to say, "this bar tells a story, and it probably involves alcohol"

  

  
* Safeguard your septims and/or wine selection within accessible yet discreet interior shelving. Surely none would affect legerdemain upon your ledger with you standing there... right?

  
TL;DR It's a 2k-4k modular replacer for bar and shop counters. Cheers!
  
  
Should be universally compatible since the dimensions, collisions and UV were carried through from the vanilla meshes. The main BOS variance file requires [Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805), the optional vanilla replacer files have no requirements.
  
  
Thanks to [dffhxc](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/41909425) for permission to include their high quality gothic facade texture from [Barsets](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/149836), I encourage you to throw them a kudos/endorsement as well.
  
And as always thanks and props to BGS and the Nexus modding community :)
