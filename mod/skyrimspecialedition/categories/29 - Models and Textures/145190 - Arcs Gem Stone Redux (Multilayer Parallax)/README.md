Arc's Gem Stone Redux is a remesh and texture overhaul for Skyrim's Gem Stone. Improving the quality and visual style of vanillas, while also staying true to the intended look of the Stones. This mod contains no esp, and features a high quality, and redesign as part of my Redux project in which I aim to redesign many of Skyrim's clutter, creatures and environments to a modern standard while keeping in mind performance and optimization.
