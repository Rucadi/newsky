Description
  
  
This is a mod that remasters ice caves. 
  
I've created the textures that I felt fit the game best and along side meshes to work with these textures.﻿

  
  
  
Compatibility notes
  
  
  
Lux:
  
It will work, but will have drastically different appearences in caves, making it potentially dark and high in contrast compared to original cave lighting.
  
  
  
If there are some special mods that you're unsure of, let me know.
