[font=Times New Roman]❖ DESCRIPTION ❖[/font]
  
  
**Version 2.0 for 2025!** Completely new, scratch-made textures, specular maps, and refined & repaired normal maps for all non-beast male races. Includes high-poly feet. True to vanilla style, extremely high detail, highly optimized. Includes both face and body textures, with alternate options for body hair, age, and dirt.
  
  
Utilizing a UDIM workflow to paint across all body parts at once (head/body/hands/feet) Skysight Skins 2.0 has some of the most seamless textures available for Skyrim.
  
  
These aren't smooth, pretty boys, but rough-and-tumble Northmen of Skyrim! The original art style was taken into heavy consideration during the making of this mod.
  
  
[font=Times New Roman]❖ WHAT'S NEW IN 2.0 ❖[/font]
  
  

  
* **Patches for SoS, SAM, The New Gentleman, Better Males, and HIMBO built into the FOMOD installer.**
Snow Elves, Briarhearts, and Vampires now included.
  
* Utilized UDIM workflow to paint across all parts of the body at once, making neck, wrist, ankle seams effectively invisible. Even on the patches for other mods.
All maps have been updated and re-worked, with more detail than ever. New levels of realism!
  
* Brand-new photorealistic face maps with three age levels - default, slightly younger, young.
All-new highly-detailed age maps; No more "painted on" age lines and spots.
  
* Patches for Khajiit and Argonian feet.
Tint mask fixes included.
  
* High poly feet patches for all vanilla armors and clothing included.
BC7 compression on all maps for highest quality / VRAM usage
  
* "Less veiny" is now the default.
"Half shine" option was removed.
  

  
  
[font=Times New Roman]❖ PACKAGES ❖[/font]
  
  
Each package was carefully optimized for its resolution to ensure proper [texel density](https://www.beyondextent.com/deep-dives/deepdive-texeldensity) across bodyparts, which also improves seams.
  
  
- **ULTRA**
  
 - 4K body (all maps)
  
 - 2K face (all maps)
  
  
- **HIGH**
  
 - 4K body diffuse, 2K spec/normal/subsurface
  
 - 2K face diffuse, 1K spec/normal/subsurface
  
  
- **PERFORMANCE** (vanilla resolution)
  
 - 2K body (all maps)
  
 - 1K face (all maps)
  
  
  
[font=Times New Roman]❖ INSTALLATION ❖[/font]
  
  

  
* **FOMOD INSTALLER:** Download one of the main files for ULTRA, HIGH, or PERFORMANCE resolution and install with the mod manage of your choice. Options for body hair, dirt, face, and patches are included in the installer.
**GRAB 'N GO:** If you don't want to deal with a FOMOD installer there are three "grab and go" packages in Optional Files for ULTRA, HIGH, or PERFORMANCE with standard vanilla options.
  

  
  
[font=Times New Roman]❖ COMPATIBILITY, PATCHES, & LOAD ORDER ❖[/font]
  
  
Patches are included in the FOMOD for the following body mods:
  
  

  
* Better Males
HIMBO
  
* SoS
SAM (Legacy - SAM Light and SOSAM are being looked into)
  
* The New Gentleman
High Poly Head
  

  
Skysight Skins should load after your body mod. Any mods that change normal maps, beast feet, etc. should load after Skysight Skins.
  
  
**HIGH POLY HEAD COMPATIBILITY**
  
VectorPlexus' High Poly Head 1.4 changes the specular and gloss values in the head NIF, which causes a seam with textures designed for vanilla head/body. An HPH option is available in the FOMOD which resolves this issue.
  
  
However, be aware that unless all of your NPCs are also using High Poly Head, you may see a seam due to the mismatched values in the player vs NPC NIFs. This is not a fault of this mod, but a side effect of HPH making changes to NIF values. This is why it's a good idea to just leave vanilla NIF values alone.
  
  
**BEAST RACE COMPATIBILITY**
  
All races in Skyrim share the same feet meshes, but because Skysight Skins does not include Argonian and Khajiit textures, this makes the feet for beast races look wrong due to the different UV layout.
  
  
Included in 2.0 are two options to work around this:
  
  

  
* A texture patch for vanilla Argonians and Khajiits to work with the high poly feet. This looks the best.
Standalone vanilla meshes to revert Argonians and Khajiits feet. This will keep them compatibile with other retextures.
  

  
  
If you are using a body mod like SoS or Better Males, you won't run into this issue, as full body textures and high poly meshes are typically included.
  
  
[font=Times New Roman]❖ RECOMMENDED MODS ❖[/font]
  
There are a few classic mods that I still like to use which compliment this one very well.
  
  

  
* [Brows](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1062) - High quality retexture of all the eyebrows
[Beards](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1067) - High quality retexture of all the beards
  
* [The Eyes of Beauty](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/130225) - High quality eye textures.
[Eye Normal Map Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5445) - Makes the normal map read the iris as concave so it reflects light realistically.
  
* [Superior Lore-Friendly Hair HD textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36510) - still my favorite
