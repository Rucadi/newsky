**What is Terrain parallax?**
  
-Skyrim has **Terrain** parallax and **mesh** parallax
  
**Terrain**: World mesh, like a planet, the seamless ground. THIS MOD
  
**Mesh:** Everything on it from the size of a mountain to smaller. STANDARD SKYRIM 2020 MOD
  
- So use Skyrim 2020 and overwrite it with this mod for terrain parallax
  
  
**What is Parallax?** 
  
- It adds height and depth to Ground/meshes. It is like an earlier tech Tesselation.
  
Activated, a Pebble should stick out a few centimeters.
  
  
**T**errain **P**arallax **T**extures differ from **S**tandard **T**extures.
  
**You can't use ST for TPT, or else you get warped textures.
  
If you want to mix mods, you need to mix TPT mods. NOT ST.**You can choose, either awesome height maps for terrain parallax on textures, or flat carpets as ground.
  
Choice should be easy.
  
  
**What's still to do? Correct meshes with bad transitions. That's due to the way terrain parallax works and [font=Arial]is in no way my fault !!![/font]**- There is an upload with the first few fixes and separated packs in the optionals.
  
  
- To fix this in 100% of cases, an esp is necessary, should be doable by any below average CK modder. So not me, hehe. Please pm.
  
What's to do?
  
- Tundra, rock... meshes that get a variety of textures, depending on the region, need the right texture entries and sometimes a checkmark for "blending" for the transparency flag. It's that easy.
  
  
Please report with screenshots and [more informative console mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19250)
  
1. Stretches in the textures
  
2. Meshes with bad transitions
