**SRP** (*Skurkbro's Retexture Project*) is a performance and lore-friendly retexture mod utilizing the game engines rendering properties and ENB to max using PBR (Physical Based Rendering) textures. Trying to bring skyrim into modern look while not bottlenecking your computer. Mod features stuff like parallax depth (optional) and ~~alternative textures~~ (removed, will be back later).  
  
  
**Latest update** (4.0) is a total overhaul. Tons of new textures. Also working to implement the new ENB feature (Complex Material) which is on my prio atm. This means that not only will some Texture have the height / depth of Parallax Occlusion Mapping but also Cubemap / Metallic. This will obviously take some time to do since I need to change the Mesh properties & the Texture map hooked into them.
  
  
**-Future plans-**
  
-Uncompressed textures as a modders resource
  
-Give you more control over the textures with brightness, saturation and parallax depth. Was thinking of a script that will automatically do this for you, but that's long ahead. Right now I'm looking for someone that's decently good with scripts / coding to help me create this tool. Please send me a message if you feel like helping. We might talk a small payment for the help.
  
  
**-IMPORTANT-**
  
You need to have [ENB Version](http://enbdev.com/download_mod_tesskyrimse.htm) 0.484+ ([SSE Parallax Shader Fix](http://nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31963) if ENB's not your thing..) in order to see the Parallax Height/Depth. Meshes included are specially made for parallax rendering and this mod, so i strongly suggest that you don't overwrite any mesh provided 'less you know what you're doing (has a strong chance on making meshes look the way they aren't intended to look) . I've included a bunch of mesh patches for commonly used mods.
  
  
  
**Help me, something's not quiet right..**
  
If there's anything that stands out in a bad way, seam is bad or is generally broken, please take a screenshot and leave it in Posts with location and mesh name (not required, but helps a tons and makes the bugfix process a lot faster).
  
  
**Known Issues - Being worked on**
  
-Farmhouse in snowy areas look completely white
