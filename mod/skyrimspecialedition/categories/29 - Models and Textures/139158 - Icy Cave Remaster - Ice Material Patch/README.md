**[font=Comic Sans MS]Changes Chunk Material from [Icy Cave Remaster](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90476?) from Snow to Ice.[/font]**

  
  

**[font=Comic Sans MS]I have Icy Cave Remaster from [RokHel](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/RokHel/mods?gameId=1704) installed in my modlist and i will never remove it.
  
By far my favorite Icy Caves overhaul. However, one thing bothered me from this mod is the fact that it also uses snow shaders. This means that on solid ice you can see footprints (when using this mod) and you can hear in my opinion the wrong sound from it. It use to have a snowy footprint sound. With this patch it has the correct solid ice sound and no more footprints on solid icy surface.

Two versions available. Normal version and a [/font][font=Comic Sans MS]**Complex Material version tweaked by [Cl3mus](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Cl3mus/mods?gameId=1704)﻿. Check out his awesome Vanaheimr Series. Truly work of art.**[/font][/center]

**[font=Comic Sans MS]Ofcourse, [Icy Cave Remaster](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90476?) is a hard requirement for this.
  
Pick one of the two option and simply overwrite the original meshes.[/font]**

**[font=Comic Sans MS]That's it and nothing more! Hope you like it.[/font]**
