This mod retextures the Falmer armor, Falmer Shield, Falmer Heavy armor, Falmer Weapons and the armor worn b Falmer Shaman. Also contains optional retextures for [Legacy of the dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802)﻿'s Ancient Loremasters and Tulrin Deathweaver and a patch for [Skyrim Immersive Creatures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12680)﻿. everything in this is t[size=3]extures only. It is safe to add or remove from your game at any time. I do not touch the falmer NPCs themselves, so it is compatible with any falmer npc replacers or retextures. I personally recommend Mandragorasprouts' excellent [Falmer Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86338)﻿[/size]
  
  
The textures for the Falmer armor and Shield are based on [Cabal120's aMidianBorn Book of Silence](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35382)﻿. I used their normal maps as a base to create my retexture. Everything else is based on vanilla textures.
  
  
Works with every mod that also works with vanilla textures, such as Heavy armory and animated armory. If you see any major stretching or dark spots when using a mesh replacer, please let me know by linking the mod in the comments and posting a picture of the bugged area (please spoiler the picture to not take too much space) and I will see if I can fix it.

**CONSISTENCY PATCHES**
  
  
Optional retextures for mods I enjoy. They are meant to help add consistency in your game, but are completely optional.
