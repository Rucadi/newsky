Inspired by animals in Red Dead Redemption 2, this mod aims to increase the quality of fur of animals in Skyrim.
  
  
So far, these animals are done:
  
-Sabrecat (all variants)
  
-Horse (all variants)
  
-Bear (all variants)
  
-Troll (Frost & Black)
  
-Wolf (all variants)
  
-Werewolf
  
-Elks
  
-Reindeer
  
-Skeever
  
-Goat
  
-Fox
  
-Dog
  
-Cow
  
  
There are 2 versions of this mod
  
1. Quality - Version without any compromises. Offers best visual quality, but may have a big fps hit (for me it ranges from 2 to 7 fps depending on the animal, but your mileage may vary)
  
2. Medium - Version aimed for better performance. Compromises were made in visuals, but the fps hit is half (if not lesser) then that of the Quality version.
  
  
If demand arises, I may consider making a lite version.
  
  
Compatibility:
  
This mod in the current stage is incompatible with other retextures, however retextures which are vanilla upscales or follow the vanilla style (like HalkHogan's HD Reworked mods) are compatible.
  
As for others, a patch needs to be made (I'll do those later)
  
  
But if you still want to make one yourself, follow these steps:
  
1. Take the diffuse texture from the mod you desire
  
2. Drag and drop it in the \_shell textures
  
3. Add some blur
  
4. Save
  
  
This might have partial compatibility with Fusa-Fusa (due to similar texture names), but I can't guarantee anything.
  
Patches for Fusa Fusa will NOT work with this mod.
  
  
Suggestions are welcome, though it does not mean I'll do absolutely everything you might suggest.
