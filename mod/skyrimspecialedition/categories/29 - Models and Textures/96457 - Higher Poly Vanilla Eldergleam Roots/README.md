# Higher Poly Vanilla Eldergleam Roots
- Author: Pieter82
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

The Eldergleam root meshes are very low poly by todays standards and it is made even more obvious by their large size. I increased their polygon count and smoothed out the meshes. I created higher poly meshes for both the static and animated roots.
  
  
**Versions:**Two versions are available, "1" makes use of vanilla texture paths and will be compatible with any vanilla texture replacer. "2" is for use with Skyrim 3D Trees and Plants as it uses the Gildergreen texture path from this mod (requires [3D Trees and Plants](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12371)). 
  
  
Compatibility:
  
This mod replaces only the mesh files, no plugin/ESP included. No textures are included in the download, your own load order will determine the actual textures used.
  
  
Installation:
  
Use your preferred mod manager to install as per normal.
  
Overwrite if prompted / give my mod priority.
