I've seen some mods like that throughout the years but it was never done perfectly. I changed that.
  
Now the "shaved head" is completely shaved Lex Luthor style.
  
Beard untouched, not necessary.
  
   
   
Technical:
  
   
hairshaved.dds -> 4x4 - DXT1 - Transparent - No Mipmaps - 1 KB (136 bytes)
  
   
hairshaved\_n.dds -> 4x4 - DXT1 - Transparent - No Mipmaps - 1 KB (136 bytes)
  
   
   
   
Update 1.1: hairshaved\_n.dds compression changed from DXT5 to DXT1.
  
DXT5 was not necessary because it has multiple alpha levels. Those have no effect with 1 bit full transparency.
