[font=Times New Roman]Reimagined Mountain Flowers - BYOH Flowers Fix
  
  
This mod simply adds edited meshes from [Reimagined Mountain Flowers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/135460), bundling up the BYOH versions of these beautiful flowers ﻿so they fit better in planters, especially ones added by JK's interiors, Snazzy Interiors, etc.[/font]

The MA asked that I add this as a patch rather than adding to their mod.  
  
  
The pictures should do all the talking.  
  
  
Enjoy!
