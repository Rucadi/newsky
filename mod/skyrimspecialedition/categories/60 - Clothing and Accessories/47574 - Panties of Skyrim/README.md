**Panties of Skyrim (immersive)**
  
  
Panties of Skyrim will add a vast number of panties across the world of Skyrim, is best used with skimpy mods, like CT77 Remodeled Armor.
  
  
-- Please read at least the about the mod --
  
  
  
**-- About the mod --**
  
  
I have the idea for this mod many years ago, when i first see cloaks of skyrim, i even start to work on the mod, but never finish, now, after many years, i decide to finally make this.
  
  
I try to make this as lore friendly as possible, you will find panties like you find any piece of armor, from vendors and NPC´s, note that not everyone has panties, don´t expect a farmer to have panties.
  
  
The base body i use is CBBE-3BBB, but should work with others CBBE, i don´t see much difference in the butt  bones weights.
  
  
The mod goes without the basic mesh, you need to create your own in Bodyslide.
  
  
Some panties can be crafted in the Tanning Rack and tempered like any other armor, most panties have requirements to be crafted, for more info, check the comments.
  
  
The shape for some panties are inspired by the thong from Remodeled Armor, the original model have some UV and topology problems, but the shape i consider perfect to avoid clipping and other problems.
  
  
And... i know, my screenshots are terrible, so, if you want to upload some screens, you are very welcome!
  
  
**-- Basic infos / Compatibility --**
  
  
This mod will use slot49 or slot52, slot52 version can have some issues with SOS.
  
The changes are on the outfit, so males will carry panties too, there is no male mesh, so the panty will not be visible, but will be in the inventory, additional patches to fix this are available, check comments for more information.
  
Compatibility patches must be pretty easy to make, just use some leveled list i put in the mod, or drop a PM and maybe i can make one.
