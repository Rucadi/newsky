This is my second mod.
  
  
**Garb:**
  
Uses body slot 32 and cape slot 46.
  
This mod replaces Hammerfell Garb by replacing the mesh files so this is expected to be incompatible with mods that replace them. Although, it should be compatible with re-texture mods that do not touch mesh files.
  
BodySlide files are included. Build using BodySlide to your preferred body shape.
  
  
**Note:**When building with BodySlide Studio, please use **AltairRedguardHDTCape** and**AltairRedguardHDTCapeOnly**item from Outfit/Body drop-down in BodySlide Studio.
  
  
**Cape:**
  
Uses cape slot 46.
  
It also includes cape as separate wearable. So you can where it with any other armor. Has some minor clipping issues as it is for **testing purposes only**.
  
Version 0.4 now includes an OutfitStudio project for the cap. This replaces old cape with the cape from main project and there is collision body in it. 
  
  
As of yet, no way to obtain through normal means. So you can use console command like;
  
*help "redguard cape" 4***Ref Id: xx000803**
  
*help "hammerfell garb cape" 4* **Ref Id: xx000801**
  
  
**Issues:**- Cape clips through the body sometimes, can't be 100% fixed!
