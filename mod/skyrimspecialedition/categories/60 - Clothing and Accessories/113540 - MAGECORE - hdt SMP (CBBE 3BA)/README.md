What is this? An actual lore friendly outfit mod and not another weeb cosplay?
  
Anyway, I've been wanting a Skyrim style mage costume for my playthrough for a while now but couldn't find anything I like. I was working on Cosplay Dress Pack at the time and have a bunch of dress model made and ready to go so I turn them into mage robes. These are not really designed coherently from ground up to be anything lore compliance but it fits and I like how it looks.
  
  
This mod introduces a pack of Winterhold College theme mage robes and accessories. The pack features 3 main types of robes which follow vanilla magic tier leveling. You can think of this as an expansion on vanilla college robes.
  
  
I don't really know what to call it so I gave it a dumb name. If this pack is doing well then I may start a new series similar to cosplay pack series but focus on low fantasy lore friendly theme.
  
Something dumb like Barbarianwave, Thiefdrip or Legionpilled
  
  
Supports only [CBBE 3BA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30174) (v2.4 or above).

THIS IS NOT A PLUG AND PLAY MOD
  
If you are a beginner with very minimal modlist and have no idea what SMP or bodyslides are, LOOK THEM UP first before getting this mod.
  
  
Warning: this mod features multiple SMP heavy parts.
  
Result may varied on lower end PC.
  
  
You can open and use bodyslide while in game and make changes to your clothing model without having to relaunch the game using MO2.
  
  
This pack has tons of custom sliders. Please check them out.

3 major pieces are the student, researcher and librarian robes. All come with SMP cloth physics. They have multiple variation based on vanilla magic tier (novice, apprentice, adept, expert and master) and each have appropriate enchantment on them.
  
  
The rest of the pack are complimenting gears and accessories. Most come with SMP physics and have multiple variations. They are unenchanted so you can customize them.
  
  
These are considered clothing so they do not have armor value and are untemperable.
  
  
The slot assignment follow the convention from [Cosplay Pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90892)﻿ but with ring and circlet slot free up for gameplay.
  
  
Further customization can be done with Bodyslide custom sliders and zap sliders

For example, bodywrap here can be customized with zap slider to cover both limbs or not cover certain part.

Or boots here come with asymmetrical design by default but you can use zap sliders to make both side short or long as you'd like.
  
  
Most pieces have this kind of customizability, check them out individually.
  
  
Aside from main dresses, lantern, hat and tome backpack also come with very immersive SMP.

Q: *How is this even lore-friendly?*
  
A: How is this not lore-friendly enough for you?
  
  
Q: *This shows too much skin. Not immersive! Skyrim is COLD!*
  
A: Ackchyually, Nords are resistant to cold and typical Nord barbarians show about as much skin.
  
  
Q: *I'm not playing Nord!*
  
A: Skyrim belongs to the Nord.
  
  
  
Serious Q&A
  
  
Q: *I am using your other mods and mod manager is giving a conflict warning when installing this mod, what?*
  
A: Ignore it, its just a few reused cubemaps.
  
  
Q: *Skirt stretch down on the ground, broken physics broken mod xdd*.
  
A: You did not install SMP correctly. Follow the instruction on SMP mod page *closely*.
  
  
Q: *I did a supercool anime summersault strike and dress got stuck in body parts, help!*
  
A: reequip to reset physics, also try doing anime summersault irl while wearing a dress and see *how it goes*.
  
  
Q: *I enter new cell and SMP is all messed up.*
  
A: Some cell entrance is so far away from world origin where you actually spawn in and the game has to move you through long distance instantly to the door you are entering the cell from. Getting warp to the entry is what mess SMP up. It is simply a game design thing, not much I can do.
  
  
In fact, if SMP behaves weirdly, reequipping or use SMP reset console is your best bet
  
I highly recommend this mod
  
[Clean Up the Physics Outfit - Collision Reset](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86845)﻿
  
for immersive way to reset SMP
  
  
Q: *Does this mod work on AE?*
  
A: Yes
  
  
Q: *Why it does not look like by character's body type?*
  
A: Build in bodyslide with your preset
  
  
Q: *Costume clip a little bit, help?*
  
A: As much as I tried to, it won't be prefect for all slider combinations. On user's side, you can fix a minor clipping by opening the outfit in Outfit Studio and use inflate tool to repair the clipped area.
  
  
I will not make bodyslide for other body mods
