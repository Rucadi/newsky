This mod seems redundant at first considering the original [Cosplay Pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90892)﻿ has a lot of the same thing featured in this mod. However, they are not standardized and kinda all over the place, making compatibility a nightmare. I decide to make this mod to address that issue and use that opportunity to remake many items using much better and more efficient technique. The result is the Cosplay Basics, a modular and standardized accessories mod for Cosplay Pack.
  
  
This mod is pretty simple in what it does but massive in terms of sheer content. It adds a lot of nice skin-tight accessories like stockings, pantyhose, garter belt and lace stuff, meant to be wore with other clothing mods as underlayer.
  
  
What do I mean by 'modular' and 'Standardized'?
  
  
This is going to be mostly an author rambling but the original Cosplay Pack also features things like stockings and garter belt and many other stuff featured here but the problem is none of them are the same. I made them little by little without planning and they ended up being different is shape, size and UV layout, making it annoying to patch. This version is made with the same standard length, shape, size and UV layout, making it a lot easier to make new content and patch for. Now all items of the same type share the same shape and UV and making new content is as simple as just plug new texture into the master project.
  
  
They are also made with much more refined and advance technique compared to stuff in original Cosplay Pack.
  
  
Supports only [CBBE 3BA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30174) (v2.4 or above).

THIS IS NOT A PLUG AND PLAY MOD
  
If you are a beginner with very minimal modlist and have no idea what SMP or bodyslides are, LOOK THEM UP first before getting this mod.
  
  
You can open and use bodyslide while in game and make changes to your clothing model without having to relaunch the game using MO2.
  
  
This mod adds the following: 
  
  
- Bodystockings/bodysuits (4 styles, 6 texture variations, has ripped version)
  
- Garter belts (4 styles, 3 length variations, 7 texture variations)
  
- Gloves (3 styles, 4 length variations, 8 texture variations, has ripped version)
  
- Nails/toenails (37 texture variations)
  
- Pasties (2 styles, 8 texture variations, has peeled version)
  
- Stockings/Socks (2 styles, 6 length variations, 8 texture variations, has ripped version)
  
- Pantyhose (5 texture variations, had ripped and pulled version)
  
- Overlay (2 styles)
  
- Doll joints (Skin tintable)
  
  
And a bunch of simple lace items.
  
  
These are made to be as skin tight as possible so you can wear it under other clothing mod for modularity and customizability.
  
  
Slots assignment:
  
  
Bodystockings/bodysuits - 38, 48
  
Garter belts - 53
  
Gloves - 33 (hand)
  
Nails/toenails - 36 (ring), 51
  
Pasties - 56, 52
  
Stockings/Socks - 38
  
Pantyhose - 38
  
Overlay - 48
  
Doll joints - 48
  
Lace anklewrap - 53
  
Lace armwrap - 58
  
Lace blindfold - 55
  
Lace hipwrap - 52
  
Lace Chestwrap - 56
  
Lace waistwrap - 53
  
Lace choker/collar - 45
  
Lace thighwrap - 54
  
Lace faceveil - 44
  
Lace veil - 42 (circlet)
  
Lace wristwrap - 34
  
  
  
Doll joints and silicon pasties uses skin shader and will use your skin color. I make a few texture patch for common skin mod out there as optional download. These patch are just diffuse map made to match the tone of those skin mods.
  
  
Lace veil and faceveil both have SMP. They are only SMP items to be featured on this pack.
  
  
  
ENB version
  
This mod features an optional complex material compatible texture.
  
What is complex material? It is an ENB feature that enables metal-gloss shader which gives surface material a much more accurate appearance than how vanilla shader Skyrim look. It is a perfect match for ENB dynamic cubemap which the ENB version also features
  
  
To use the ENB version, you much enable complex material, or else texture will look bright and buggy.
  
  
How to Enable:
  
1) get your ENB working (using latest built)
  
2) navigate to your game root folder or your ENB preset folder
  
3) Find enbseries.ini and open it

under [EFFECT] look for these. If it isn't here, add it. If it is but ' = false ' then ' = true ' to enable them.
  
4) Save then exit  ﻿
  
  
You won't see much change to your game visual or performance unless you have mod that is made for these features so it is safe to just leave it on and don't think about it.
  
  
As for other non-ENB dynamic cubemap feature such as community shader, there is no support out of the box. I don't use CS personally so I have no clue to how make a patch for it. Feel free to make a patch for it, should it requires.

Q: *Bruh Bruh Bruh, this is sooooo bloated! 2GB for a few stockings, seriously?*
  
A: kinda, yeah. But it is so nice, it is going to be the only stockings mod you will ever need.
  
  
Q: *I am using your other mods and mod manager is giving a conflict warning when installing this mod, what?*
  
A: Ignore it, its just a few reused cubemaps.
  
  
Q: *Does this mod work on AE?*
  
A: Yes
  
  
Q: *Why it does not look like by character's body type?*
  
A: Build in bodyslide with your preset
  
  
Q: *Costume clip a little bit, help?*
  
A: As much as I tried to, it won't be prefect for all slider combinations. On user's side, you can fix a minor clipping by opening the outfit in Outfit Studio and use inflate tool to repair the clipped area.
  
  
I will not make bodyslide for other body mods
