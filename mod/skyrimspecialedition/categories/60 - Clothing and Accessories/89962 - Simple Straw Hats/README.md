# Simple Straw Hats

[font=Comic Sans MS]A colection of simplistic, vanilla friendly colorfull straw hats for your dragonborn to wear, be it man, woman, cat or lizard. They are all considered circlets by the game, therefore they don't hide your hair when you wear it. There may be some clipping with a few KS hairs or similar stuff, but thats expected, as I can't fine tune the hat for every single hair in existance.
  
  
the hats can be crafted (and scrapped back to straw) at the tanning rack by using either 1 straw and 2 leather strips or by using the apropriate basket and some leather strips. So now you have something to do with baskets! You can also buy then from Khajiit caravans or at Radiant Raiment in solitude.
  
  
A patch for the colorfull baskets added by the creation club houses (the ones made by [Elianora](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3231858)) is also available, check the last pictures to see how they look in-game. It is recomended to be used with [Creation Club Basket Distribution](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74577) and, obviously, require some creation club content/aniversary edition.
  
  
This mod is also intended as a modder's resource, so feel free to use those hats whenever you like! (just put my name in the credits tho).[/font]
