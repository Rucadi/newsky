Aside from metal jewelry, this pack also heavily features gemstone jewelry. These jewelries use advance technique and setup to simulate gem shader in a more high tech renderer where light is getting caught in the gem and there is slight dispersion (all fake of course, this is a 10 years old game). By default, reflection uses specular but if you use ENB, dynamic cubemap is enabled by default to give a much better reflection. 
  
  
Jewelries features are: armlets, bracelets, chokers, necklaces, thighlets, earrings, and crowns.
  
Only the earrings feature SMP.

You can change gemstone type in bodyslide using UV slider! (Do not tick them twice or you will get error)

Another innovative items featured in this mods are the boa. Boa comes in three types: fur, feather and cloth. there is also a scarf and shawl version.
  
  
These Boa have a unique SMP setup which allow it to anchor to each arm like a chain link to give it a realistic behavior. One down side is it can get stretch if you happened to fan your arm wide at the time of equipping. It is generally recommend that you equip it at rest post or anything close to that.

There are custom sliders to adjust the fluffiness of the fur.
  
  
There is also a jacket item that use the same fur system.
  
  
Aside from the dresses, jewelries and boa, this pack also features support items such as high heels, thong panties and sash, all centered around luxurious Gala theme.

Passive-Aggressive Q&A
  
  
Q: *Bruh Bruh Bruh, this is sooooo bloated! 2.2GB for a few dresses, seriously?*
  
A: ChadYes, I could've chopped it up into 13 mods and farm DP but I want to see you download a 2.2GB mod.
  
  
Q: *Can we get a standalone or separate version?*
  
A: Statistics on my previous mods said you're a super minority. But sure, I make chopped version at some point as optional.
  
  
Q: *Will this mod conflict with the original Thorn Princess? Can I keep them both?*
  
A: There is nothing inherently incompatible so you can keep both. But remake version is so much nicer.
  
  
Q: *I am using your other mods and mod manager is giving a conflict warning when installing this mod, what?*
  
A: Ignore it, its just a few reused cubemaps.
  
  
Q: *Skirt stretch down on the ground, broken physics broken mod xdd*.
  
A: You did not install SMP correctly. Follow the instruction on SMP mod page *closely*.
  
  
Q: *I did a supercool anime summersault strike and dress got stuck in body parts, help!*
  
A: reequip to reset physics, also try doing anime summersault irl while wearing a dress and see *how it goes*.
  
  
Q: *I enter new cell and SMP is all messed up.*
  
A: Some cell entrance is so far away from world origin where you actually spawn in and the game has to move you through long distance instantly to the door you are entering the cell from. Getting warp to the entry is what mess SMP up. It is simply a game design thing, not much I can do.
  
  
In fact, if SMP behaves weirdly, reequipping or use SMP reset console is your best bet
  
I highly recommend this mod
  
[Clean Up the Physics Outfit - Collision Reset](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86845)﻿
  
for immersive way to reset SMP
  
  
Q: *Does this mod work on AE?*
  
A: Yes
  
  
Q: *Why it does not look like by character's body type?*
  
A: Build in bodyslide with your preset
  
  
Q: *Costume clip a little bit, help?*
  
A: As much as I tried to, it won't be prefect for all slider combinations. On user's side, you can fix a minor clipping by opening the outfit in Outfit Studio and use inflate tool to repair the clipped area.
  
  
I will not make bodyslide for other body mods
