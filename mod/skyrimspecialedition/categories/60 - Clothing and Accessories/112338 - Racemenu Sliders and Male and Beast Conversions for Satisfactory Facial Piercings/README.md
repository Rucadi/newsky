# Racemenu Sliders and Male and Beast Conversions for Satisfactory Facial Piercings
- Author: Atshi
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/112338


**TO INSTALL**1. Install Satisfactory Facial Piercings
  
2. Install this mod after the original
  
3. Make sure Satisfactory Facial Piercings.esp is loaded **BEFORE ﻿**Satisfactory Conversions.esp
  
  
  
  
I thought the way Satisfactory Facial Piercings added piercings as a HeadPart so they could move with the face was pretty cool. However, because of how the piercings are added, it either causes blackface bug or potato face. I wanted that for my khajiit, so I decided to convert them for males and beast races, and add them as RaceMenu sliders.
  
  
I didnt do the fancy custom High Poly Head sculpt that Atshi did on the original mod to make the industrials and other piercings look better, but they look good enough to me without it.
  
  
This contains no textures, and no files for human females, and no papyrus wizardry, so you'll require the original Satisfactory Facial Piercings.
  
  
I am unaware of if the items to add the piercings will work at all, I havent tested them at all and don't plan to. If they work they work, if they don't then just use Proteus to add them to an NPC
  
  
Helix piercings and Winry piercings are missing. This is because I could not come up with a solution I was satisfied with. All the files for them are  there, if you want them, navigate to meshes\actors\character\facegenmorphs\Satisfactory Facial Piercings.esp\sliders, open up human.ini, and remove the # before those piercings' lines.
  
  
Argonians do not have any of the earrings. This is because the assistant at Claire's kicked me out when I tried to bring the Argonian in for them.
  
  
As this does not touch the female human piercing files, it supports all the same mods listed on that page.
  
  
**Currently, this supports:**
  
High Poly Head

If you've got one that isn't supported and would like it to be, please leave a comment and let me know. NO guarantees but I may get around to attempting to support it
  
  
  
**KNOWN ISSUES BECAUSE I AM NOT AN OUTFITSTUDIO WIZARD:**
  

  
* Some piercings look weird on Vanilla head. Just use High Poly Head.
The lip rings can morph weird on Dunmer  and Bretons
  
* ﻿Industrials and other ear piercings may look odd on elves
Septum piercings float above some nose types.
  
* Going back into racemenu after character creation when using the Lunar Lattice Tweaks patch causes duplicate piercings to appear, but just adding the race to the file without the patch causes no piercings to appear
Presets can get wonky
  

  
Most of these issues might be temporarily fixed if you use the Sculpt feature in RaceMenu. I'll be coming back to this every now and then trying to work on getting the morphs down even better.
  
  
**If your piercings are discolored, try installing [Custom Cubemaps](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/112763), or [ENB Cubemaps](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98122) (if using ENB).** The piercings use chitin\_e\_ebony.dds for their cubemaps, which many mods overwrite with their own version.
