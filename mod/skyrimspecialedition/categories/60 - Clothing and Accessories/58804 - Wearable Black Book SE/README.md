This is a long due SE port of my Wearable Black Book mod.
  
  
This mod adds a few new items;
  
A Black Book that you can wear on either your hip, or in your hand.
  
There is also a scripted version that switches the model from hip to hand when you take out your spells for combat.
  
  
The books come in unenchanted and enchanted versions. The enchanted version makes all spells 33% cheaper to cast.
  
The books use slot 55 and show up on your hip and 58 to show up in your left hand.
  
  
Use Additemmenu mod or console to get the item, or find a satchel upstairs in the abandoned building in Raven Rock.
  
The mod requires Dragonborn dlc.
