**Left Hand Rings Modified SE**

  
Adds rings that are worn on the left hand. These rings can be crafted, enchanted, bought from merchants, and found randomly as treasure.
  
  
This release is a modification of [Left Hand Rings](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/21720) by Duggelz. This mod was initially created in response to the many requests posted on the original mod's page for a different body slot number to resolve conflicts with certain mods.  All left hand rings are now assigned to body slot 51 with exception of the Bond of Matrimony which uses body slot 50.
  
  
ADDITIONAL FEATURES:
  
 ▪ 6 new left hand rings using the missing combination sets of ring/gemstone.
  
 ▪ A new Bond of Matrimony ring that can be worn all the time on the proper hand and finger.
  
 ▪ Left hand convertible versions of the Ring of Hircine, Ring of Namira, Bone Hawk ring, and Ahzidal's rings.
  
▪ Merged with juf0816's Left Hand Enchanted Rings which adds the vanilla enchanted rings for the left hand.
  
 ▪ Option to see rings on the left hand while in first person view.
  
• Ring icon and label for the left hand rings in the SkyUI menus.
  
 ▪ Support for Static Mesh Improvement Mod, Gemling Jewelry Queen, and the Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.
  
▪ Cleaned with TES5Edit.

*v4.5 - 2018/11/16*
  
- Fixed missing mesh for the left hand rings of sneaking, minor sneaking, and extreme blocking.  Thanks to DMA0972 and lezsq.
  
- Modified Namira's Ring so the feed option will not appear until the effect from the last feeding has worn off.
  
- Removed the broken left hand Frostmoon rings.  Use a forge to revert the rings back to the original right hand versions.  Note for translators: description text has been added to the broken rings.
  
- The left hand ring of Eurdite (xx00E7FE) or the Beast (xx00E7FD) might disappear from your inventory.  Use console to get them back.
  
- Updated Left Hand Ring Recipes.jpg to reflect changes.
