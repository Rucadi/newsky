At last I've ported this mod from LE to the SE.
  
  
Similar to my [Wearable Black Book](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58804), his mod that adds spellbooks, scrolls and staves that can be worn on either character's hand or hip.
  
The books come from each school of magic and have enchanted and unenchanted versions. The enchanted books make their respective skill 25% cheaper to cast.
  
Items in hand use slot 58 and items on hip slot 55.
  
  
The mod contains also scripted versions of the items.
  
The scripted items have "(s)" in their name, and use slot 55 (and FX slot 61), and will display the book or scroll in either the player's hand or on hip depending on if weapons/spells are readied.
  
The staves have only scripted versions but can be used simultaneously with books or scrolls.
  
  
To get the items, use Additemmenu or search a sack container in The Midden under the College of Winterhold.
  
  
  
This mod requires Dragonborn DLC.
  
  
Thanks to pw508 for the idea of expanding my black book mod.
