So what this mod does:
  
  
- Realistic bone-weights for the top.
  
- Squeeze sliders for the top, and leg band.
  
- Specular strenght upped to 1.0 for the top
  
- Slight edit to lower part of the top, to remove clipping with panties
  
- Edited bone weights for the pouches, less stretching, keep their shape better.
  
- Removed belly and genitalia weighting from clothes
  
- Adds cubemap reflections to metallic parts.
  
---> Adds two env map textures for them, that vanilla game is missing.
  
------> Will use dynamic cubemaps if you have vanilla replacer for them, uses vanilla gold\_ore if not.
  
- Minor optimization, removed some bogus nodes and unused strings from top.
  
  
That is about it.

**Instruction
  
Please read;**
  
Spoiler
  
Mod conflicts:
  
- Overwrite original gloves.
  
- Torso uses separate files.
  
  
- If conflict with the added env map textures:
  
-> Let your texture replacer overwrite textures from this.
  
  
Building in Bodyslide:
  
- Rebuild gloves
  
- Torso under name:"Elegant Merchant Clothes 3BA squeeze"
  
  
**Adjust the sliders (remember to adjust for both 0 and 100 weight) to your liking, and build.
  
- Body weighting was done with the top nip slip slider at 0.** 
  
--> Depending on your body preset, you can try different values for the "nip slip", but I recommend zero.
  
- I recommend toggling the hidden zaps on that I added (to avoid clipping)
  
  
Press T to hide textures, press W to show wireframe overlay.
  
You can go values over 100, or even negative values, if you type them in the box.

As a tip, **you can save the values to your Preset**, since the sliders have unique names.
  
So when you open (or batch build) the outfit next time in BS, the values and zaps are at what you saved them as.
  
  
  
Gif below (different mod), I save the values to the preset, and the other item with same unique slider names, have them set automatically:

This allows for batch building too, since the slider values are saved, and unique to those pieces.
  
  
  
  
As a side note, I made this as personal edit, but after checking, original mod has open perms, so I shared this.
  
So this is mainly done with [this preset](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/119350) in mind, but test in-game how it works for you. Petite or busty, **adjust the sliders for your body preset**.
  
  
As a another side note, I will be uploading updated version of that preset in near future, that has all squeeze slider values saved for my mods.

The two added env map textures are for male and female merchant torso textures (BC1).
  
They are based on vanilla diffuse, but should go well with other texture replacers that keep vanilla look intact.
  
They do nothing on their own, models need to be adjusted to use them.
  
Feel free to apply them to (merchant) models if you wish. This is for another mod, but same principle, instructions in this [article](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/9553).
