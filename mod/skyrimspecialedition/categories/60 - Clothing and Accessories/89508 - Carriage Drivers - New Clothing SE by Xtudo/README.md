**Carriage Drivers - New Clothing**
  
**By Xtudo**

  
**Description**
  
**A standardized vestment for the carriage drivers.**I never really liked the farm clothes they wore, especially because of the ugly clipping on the legs, very immersion breaking. So I made this mod for my game, and now I'm sharing it.
  

  
* **Four different outfit versions.** Suited for their locations, forest, city, cold, etc. Now, in cold areas like Windhelm or Dawnstar, they will wear gloves, a fur collar and hood, for example.
The new outfits are non playable.
  
* Carried on USEEP fixes. ESL
It works very nice with [Lively cart driver animation replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70595), recommended!﻿
  
* If any of the drivers is not wearing the new outfit, use "resetinventory" on him.

  
**Optional files**
