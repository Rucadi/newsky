**﻿Cultural Bards**
  
Why do bards in Skyrim wear farm clothes? That's boring! Bard clothing should be colorful and stylish (and maybe show some skin, for that extra septim...). With this mod, the once drab bards now look like proper entertainers with their own distinct style. The outfits are tailored to according to their individual characteristics and in game interactions. Now you know a bard when you see one!
  
  
**Features**
  

  
* 12 new outfit mashups for male and female, along with color variants for a total of 19 new outfits
5 cloak items, a new hat, 2 backpacks and 6 accessories
  
* Ground models for everything
[SkyPatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106659) distribution of unique outfit combinations for all vanilla bards
  

  

**Technical Info**

  

  
* The meshes are for CBBE and HIMBO bodies. Prebuilt meshes are CBBE Curvy and [HIMBO - Almost Vanilla](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/121450)﻿. Conversions are welcome!
The fur cloaks and redguard cape can be mixed and matched, but the wanderer gear is specially fitted for the wanderer outfit only.
  
* The fur cowl on the dean robes cannot be removed.
Armlets and Bracelets use slot 58 & 59 respectively
  
* Can be crafted at tanning rack and forge. College items are locked behind the bards college questline. SpoilerStudent outfits can be crafted after speaking to Viarmo about retrieving the verse. Headmaster and dean robes require completion of '[Tending the Flames](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Tending_the_Flames)﻿'
Safe to add mid game. Bards you already met may not wear the new outfits, running 'resetinventory' console command should resolve the issue.

Disclaimer: I am just an amatuer modder and this is my first time providing HIMBO Bodyslides. It may not be perfect, if you notice anything weird let me know. Testing was done with 'average' presets, extreme settings may result in weird distortions. Some of the ground models are needlessly detailed, if you run into lag issues when scrolling inventory grab the simplified meshes in optional files.
