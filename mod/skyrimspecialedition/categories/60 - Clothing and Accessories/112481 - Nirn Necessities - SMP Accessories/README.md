Nirn Necessities is a pack of physics-enabled accessories with a low-fantasy aesthetic, focused on everyday items that a citizen of Tamriel would wear, such as: satchels, backpacks, cloaks, etc. Designs inspired by apparel in other RPGs like Dragon's Dogma 2, Outward, Dungeonborne and Baldur's Gate III.

**FEATURES**
  

  
* Handmade quality meshes and textures, each item having multiple colour options
Most items physics-enabled through SMP, including smaller details like flaps, buckles and strings
  
* Optimized physics performance through no-collision physics and low-poly proxy collisions
Particle light support for glowing accessories
  
* Satchels, backpacks & pouches give carry weight, scarves are flagged 'warm' for Survival Mode
Base meshes are fitted for the vanilla body, Bodyslide files for 3BA & HIMBO are included.
  

**OBTAINING ITEMS**
  
Items can be crafted at a forge, and are also distributed to merchant levelled lists to purchase.
  
Optionally, you can select [SPID](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869) distribution to NPCs directly in the FOMOD installer.

**REQUIREMENTS**
  

  
* [Faster HDT-SMP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57339?)
(Optional) [SPID](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869)﻿
  
* (Optional) [Bodyslide](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/201)﻿ + CBBE 3BA + HIMBO
(Optional) [Light Limit Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99548)﻿ or ENB for glowing objects
  

**INSTALLATION**
  
Please use a mod manager.
  
Build outfits in Bodyslide if using other body mods, otherwise items will fit the vanilla body by default.
  
Feel free to install the mod mid-save, but uninstalling mid-save is not recommended.
  
  
**COMPATIBILITY**
  
Should be compatible with anything. Some mods use different '[slots](https://wiki.nexusmods.com/index.php/Skyrim_bodyparts_number)' for their items, and may not be worn together.
  
Please note that modular items are inherently more likely to clip with existing outfits. Shoulder & neck items fit best on tighter torso equipment.
  
HDT-SMP sometimes has exaggerated physics. See below!

> Here, you can see (left side) the main flap of the backpack clipping into itself.

> This does not always happen, and I am unsure why it is inconsistent.

> If you do not have the MCM, you can change this in:

> Faster HDT-SMP\SKSE\Plugins\hdtSkinnedMeshConfigs\configs.xml
>   
>        and set <groupEnableMLCP>true</groupEnableMLCP> from false to true.
>   
>   
> If you do not want to sacrifice any performance,
>   
> re-equipping the item, or swapping to another colour variant of said item will sometimes fix it.
>   
>   
> If you're knowledgeable about SMP and know how to prevent this without changing settings, let me know!

**DISTRIBUTION DETAILS**
  
Most items have been added to vendor levelled lists, (general trade stores,) and you can sometimes find 'fancier' items at Radiant Raiment.
  
To see all the SPID options in the FOMOD installer, open the spoiler below.
  
Spoiler
  
Each module is a SPID option you can select in the installer.
  
These are minimal-impact to prevent clipping issues.

**OTHER DETAILS**
  
Most diffuse & normal textures are 2K BC7, some normal & miscellaneous textures are lower and use a variety of compression.
  
I might consider an HD 'choice cuts' pack for items that would benefit the most one, but since these are small items, it's fine the way it is.
  
This also uses some vanilla environment maps, so mods that change that will affect the look of metal.
  
  
**Q:** Version without physics?
  
**A:** [Here, by Xtudo!](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/133857)
  
  
> This mod is a 'made over a long time, worked in chunks' kind of project. I learned a lot throughout. Early on, I didn't have any specific 3d goals, but the previous Illusive Infiltrator backpack had a completely unnecessary count of 23.5k triangles. There was average-density geometry in places you *couldn't even see*, like under the pockets. It didn't even have SMP to justify a higher poly count for deformations!
>   
>   
> The highest poly count item in Nirn Necessities is the Exquisite Cape as an outlier, as it uses real geometry for the chains: 22k total triangles. (I tried flat planes with opacity, and I wasn't satisfied with the look in-game.) The second highest is the Reinforced Backpack + the Lantern addition, at 11k triangles.
>   
>   
> After several months of work, I found some objects difficult to create just through poly-modelling. So, I tried out Marvelous Designer and made [Southbound Scouts](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/122550)! I then returned to this project and was able to make some items with much more ease, like the masks, scarves and capes :D

>   
> Q: did you just google 'medieval \_\_\_\_\_' and then make the first 10 results for some of these?
>   
> A: [no](https://youtu.be/eB6txyhHFG4?si=DBOZBvSko6Xh7xYu&t=66)
