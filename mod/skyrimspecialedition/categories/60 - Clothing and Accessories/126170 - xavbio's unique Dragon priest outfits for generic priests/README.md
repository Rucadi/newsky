**-installation guide**
  
  
You need [xavbio dragon priest retexture](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/101101?tab=files) and [humanoid dragon priest](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/122320?tab=description).
  
  
1. install xavbio's dragon priest retexure but Do not select unique dp during installation since they are included in humanoid dragon priest patch. Color used in his patch are Blue Gem & Glided Ebony.
  
2. install Humanoid Dragon Priests main file and it's xavbio unique DP patch
  
3. install my mod and that's it.
  
  
**-what you get:**
  
you will have four different outfits for generic priests instead of same most boring one:
  
1.  generic fire template will use nahkriin glided ebony outfit.
  
2. generic ice template will use vahlok outfit.
  
3. generic shock template will use dukaan outfit.
  
4. generic template wasn't changed even though I wanted to :D because I feel bad to completely delete the iconic outfit.
  
5. if you own cc the cause then the Aylied lich "Norion the Undying" will wear morokei outfit so he no longer has his unique AE outfit but he is patched for humanoid dragon priests now.
  
  
note: these 4 templates each have an equal chance to appear instead of draugr bosses in some dungeons at high levels.
  
  
optional patch for [Dragon Priest Curalmil](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/124889?tab=posts) mod to wear vokun outfit.
