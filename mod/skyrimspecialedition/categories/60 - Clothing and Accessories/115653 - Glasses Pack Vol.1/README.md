This is a small collection of simple glasses accessories for your character, usable by both male and female.
  
  
I rehost this on Nexus to simplify permission for use with mods like followers and such.
  
  
Feel free to use it in your mod. You are allowed to upload this asset along with your mod, provided that you link this page in your credit.

This mod adds 6 pairs of unique glasses, each has 2 texture variations and comes with regular lens version and sunglasses version.
  
  
Glasses are very customizable with many custom slider options

You can open Bodyslide on the side while your game is running, press build and re-equip to see changes from slider immediately in-game. Use this method to keep adjusting until the glasses perfectly fit your character face.
  
  
It's a very small and simple mod, not much more to talk about.
  
  
ENB version
  
  
This mod features an optional complex material compatible texture.
  
  
What is complex material? It is an ENB feature that enables metal-gloss shader which gives surface material a much more accurate appearance than how vanilla shader Skyrim look. It is a perfect match for ENB dynamic cubemap which the ENB version also features
  
  
To use the ENB version, you much enable complex material, or else texture will look bright and buggy.
  
  
How to Enable:
  
1) get your ENB working (using latest built)
  
2) navigate to your game root folder or your ENB preset folder
  
3) Find enbseries.ini and open it

under [EFFECT] look for these. If it isn't here, add it. If it is but ' = false ' then ' = true ' to enable them.
  
4) Save then exit  ﻿
  
  
You won't see much change to your game visual or performance unless you have mod that is made for these features so it is safe to just leave it on and don't think about it.
  
  
As for other non-ENB dynamic cubemap feature such as community shader, there is no support out of the box. I don't use CS personally so I have no clue to how make a patch for it. Feel free to make a patch for it, should it requires.
