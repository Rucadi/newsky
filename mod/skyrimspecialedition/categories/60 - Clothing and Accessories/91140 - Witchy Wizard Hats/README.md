I love witch hats. But unfortunately most witch hat mods are too glamorous or aren't quite shaped to my taste. So here's something I did for myself using [sirwho's](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/1330377)﻿ [Wizard Hats](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2385)﻿ mod.
  
  
I ended up making two versions, one that's sort of your standard floppy witch hat peak height, and one that's a little lower, inspired by some of the hats found in Hogwarts Legacy.
  
I like both of them so I'm sharing both of them :)
  
  
Available in a full replacer version or female only version!
