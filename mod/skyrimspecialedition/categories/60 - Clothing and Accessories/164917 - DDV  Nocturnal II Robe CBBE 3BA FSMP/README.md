**Hi
  
So, the penultimate dress :)
  
Here, I improved the HDT a little bit again, but of course, some compromises had to be made.
  
  
The mod includes 3 color combinations: gold, black, and green.
  
The set is divided into a dress with a skirt and belt, a hood, a collar, a necklace, and shoes.
  
  
The hood and necklace also come in a version WITHOUT HDT.
  
The hood comes in a version with and without hair.
  
Fully modular.
  
  
Enjoy!**
