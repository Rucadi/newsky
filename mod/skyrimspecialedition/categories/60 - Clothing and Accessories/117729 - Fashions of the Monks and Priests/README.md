Once again I'm back. This time there **should** be maximum compatibility with body replacers (since I don't use them I can't test - would love some feed back on this) as all the heavy lifting is done via texture sets on vanilla meshes. So as long as your body replacer of choices leverages vanilla textures there shouldn't be any problem. There is also an optional esp to revert the custom male meshes (there are only 2) to use vanilla meshes also for compatibility with the likes of HIMBO etc or those who prefer the vanilla look. There are  fair few very good vanilla meshes barely utilised so, as an example, I've created a new armour addon and record for the wedding sandals (monk sandals), renamed them and put them to work (on females - Bethesda being Bethesda were a mite too lazy to create a male model). To be clear this doesn't edit any base game records. 
  
  
As always credits first since I do not claim ownership of, nor for responsibility for, the creation of any assets used. I'm solely responsible for the esp work.

So now the what. This is a targeted NPC outfit replacer to diversify the various monks and priests throughout Skyrim. Here I took some darker grittier textures from Divergence for some where I deemed it appropriate (i.e. Followers of Arkay) and some of the cleaner more pristine textures from Robes Retexture (i.e. for the divines robes) and some some more flamboyant robes from Willybach's resource. 
  
  
The who in no particular order:
  
  
**Danica Pure-Spring** - Devoted to the Gildergreen, I wanted her outfit to reflect her personal passions. Now looks at one with nature.
  
**Kynareth Robes** - I know Kynareth's element is air, but in the context of Whiterun I thought robes which were more 'nature' oriented were in order. Worn by Acolyte Jenssen.
  
**Dibella** - No more hoods, these are ladies who let their hair down. Hamal also has a wreath to differentiate her as the master of the temple. Worn by the 4 priestesses of Dibella.
  
**Azura** - Araena sits up there in the mountains near Winterhold. The temple priest robes (with a darker purple courtesy of Sforzinda) I felt were both warmer and more fitting. 
  
**The Divines** - I felt that a pristine white fitted followers of the divines in Solitude, with a dash of imperial red. Worn by Rorlund and Freir.
  
**Silana Petreia** - She is only a novice, so she hasn't earned the right to wear the white. But she is carrying a little something reflecting her position on the big man.
  
**Mara** - A deep red, which I though was fitting for followers of the goddess of love. Worn by Dinya and Maramal.
  
**Erandur** - A more rustic outfit for the journeyman monk. Optionally uses Hooded robes of Mara. Example of this in images. 
  
**Talos Male** - More Rustic and Nordic, reflecting their allegiance. Optionally uses Hooded robes of Talos. Worn by Heimskr and Lortheim. Example in images. 
  
**Talos Female** - I contemplated using the same meshes as for the males, but it didn't seem worth it from a compatibility pov. Utilises a darker, deeper stormcloak style blue. Worn by Nura and Jora.
  
**Arkay** - A darker brown, but with a snazzy gold trim which I felt fit the priests of Arkay perfectly. Goes for Runil, Alessandra, Andurs, Styrr and Helgird.
  
**Maurice** - More Gildergreen styled robes for the devotee. 
  
**Ahlam** - Nazeem's wife is a healer  who works in the temple of Kynareth, but also married to a rich man. She has her own bespoke robes with a nice gold trim. 
  
  
And that's about it - fairly simple. Hope you like it.
