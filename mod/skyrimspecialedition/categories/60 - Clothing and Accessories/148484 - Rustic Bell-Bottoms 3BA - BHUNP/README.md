✂️ Light and Clothing variants craftable with balanced material requirements. Enchantable.
  
  
⚠️ You will need to **build the meshes in BodySlide** unless you use something like OBody (pre-built meshes with zeroed sliders included).[/size]
  
  
**Requirements**
  
[BodySlide](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/201)﻿ to build the meshes in your chosen preset
  
[3BA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30174)﻿ or [BHUNP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31126) 
  
  
**Credits**
  
This is a mashup. The base textures are by [Xavbio](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93890) ﻿and the base mesh was borrowed from [ghouls0rules](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/141830)' own mashup with a belt by [size=3][Nisetanaka](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/83383)﻿. I increased the poly count to deform better with morphs, redid the weights, added cubemaps, made some minor poly tweaks, created a low-rise version, and reimplemented everything in-game.
  
  
The BHUNP conversion and ground objects were kindly provided by [kroenel](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/kroenel/mods) and [LummoxJR](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/LummoxJR/mods) respectively.
