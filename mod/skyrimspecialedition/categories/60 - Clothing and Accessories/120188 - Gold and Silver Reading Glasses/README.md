**Gold & Silver Reading Glasses**

by Elza

This mod adds two pairs of[size=3] lore-friendly ornate 'pince-nez' reading glasses originally made by Elza.
  
  
I made them into their own separate mod (+ ESL-flagged), optimized the meshes for SE/AE, added crafting, fixed the missing cubemaps, added SPID distribution, a silver version, and beast race support. They occupy slot 55 ("face alternate or jewelry").
  
  
The glasses can be crafted at a forge with a few materials - gold or silver ingots for the frames, a steel ingot for screws, and glass for the lenses. They're also enchantable.
  
  
That's about it.[/size]
