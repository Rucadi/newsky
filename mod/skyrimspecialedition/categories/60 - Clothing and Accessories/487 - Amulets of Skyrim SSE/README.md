[font=Times New Roman]*Amulets of Skyrim*[/font]
  
   
This mod adds over 230 new amulets (and a few rings) to Skyrim and gives these amulets to some named NPCs. Most of amulets are placed at several locations and some amulets are sold by Amulet merchant who is in the Ragged Flagon. Ulfric Stormcloak and General Tullius have their own unique amulet.
  
This mod is the SSE version of [Amulets of Skyrim](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57113/?).
  
[line]**Compatibility**   
- This mod doesn't change any quests, NPC's data, or Vendor's chest, and seems to be compatible with most of other mods.
  
- This mod has better compatibility with [Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266/?). But we don't need the unofficial patch as master files. This mod will work without the unofficial patch.
  
- Has the compatibility with [Immersive Jewelry](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5336/?)'s enchanting system.
