This mod absolutely will not function without [Wearable Horns](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54531), so be sure to download it (and endorse it!)

  
  
I did my best to adjust the horns to fit both Khajiit and Argonians, but some aren't perfect. Also, I couldn't get Horns 6 to work at all with Khajiit, but I unlocked it anyways in case someone wants to use them with a helmet or something. Otherwise, let me know if you find any issues: it's a massive amount of variants, so I very easily could've missed something. Works fine with a few different beast race model variations I tried too.
  
  

Please see original mod for an idea of what all the horns look like. Feel free to post any screenshots too!
