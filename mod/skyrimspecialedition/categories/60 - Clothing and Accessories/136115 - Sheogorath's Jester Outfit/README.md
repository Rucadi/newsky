This mod adds a standalone outfit set and spell inspired by Dark Fantasy.
  
  
The outfit all share has no armor stats, and isn't seen as clothing, which means you craft them at a forge under the Misc section! (Or use console commands/[AddItemMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17563))
  
  
Outfit in game is named ''Sheogorath's [Outfit Piece]''. Spell is ''Sheogorath's Wrath''.
  
  
Males and Females have custom meshes.
  
  
There are 2 main files for this mod. The **Render***Version* will make your armor appear how it does in the screenshots titled **Render***Version*. The **Haskill***Version* will make the armor how it appears in the screenshots titled **Haskill***Version*.
  
  
**If you wear certain pieces by themselves you will see clipping issues.
  
  
Read credits and permissions please.**
