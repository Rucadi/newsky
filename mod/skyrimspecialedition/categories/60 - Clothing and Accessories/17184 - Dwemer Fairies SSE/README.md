Important!!!! Please read the new Sticky post about the Black Rectangle bug!!!!  This is about the new updated file that corrects the bug!!!
  
  
  
This is a port of Dwemer Fairies from original Skyrim to SSE.  All credits go to Onota for the design and implementation of this mod.  Many thanks for allowing open permission.  The original mod can be found here:

The .esp has been run through the Creation Kit and saved in form 44.  Originally when I processed the meshes for these through the SSE NifOptimizer,  the glowing ball part would not show up at all.  The other things like the mechanical wings and animations work just fine.  Many thanks to bchick3 for helping me diagnose the issues and find the solution to the problem.  Apparently the meshes did not convert well and had to be kept in their original state in order to work properly.  I did try it out in my game with the original meshes and the glowing ball part does show up. 
  
  
IMPORTANT:  Please note that depending on what viewpoint you play the game in,  when you first equip the Fairy,  the glowing ball will not show.  To remedy this,  unequip and re-equip the Fairy to see the glowing ball part.  Not sure why this happens but it may be a side effect of the original meshes for SSE. 
  
  
This may not happen for everybody but it does happen for me when I first equip them in my game.  It was noted in the comment section of the Oldrim page that ENBs might affect how the glowing ball looks.  Load orders and other mods might affect the glowing part as well.

Onota recently made a Dwemer Fairies ENB Particle mod for ENB users.  That mod is not Standalone however and you must install this mod first before using her ENB update.  Her ENB Fairies can be found here:

Romulus Gaming recently made a video showcasing several Magic mods and decided to include my port of Dwemer Fairies.  Thanks so much.

[color=#ff0000][color=#ff7700]These are not meant to be used as a light source in dark places.  The original mod was not designed that way.  You will still need an external light source (ie torch),  spell or another mod that I highly recommend called Everlight - Torches of Skyrim SE by Undriel[/color].  These are gorgeous and a lot of work has gone into that mod.  You can find it here:

Pertinent details:
  
The way Onota created the original mod,  you had to add the Fairies with console commands.  Later, Onota added the ability to craft them with an optional .esp.  I have taken the liberty to convert the mod with the crafting .esp so the player can craft these if he/she wishes to do so.  The player can also add them with the console as well so you don't have to craft them if you don't want to.  If you wish to add them via console,  all you have to do is add them with "help 'fairyname' " 4 to get the form ID so they can be added to inventory the easy way.  I have provided pictures in the gallery showing all crafting materials needed for constructing all the different Fairies.  Only one Fairy can be equipped at any given time.  
  
  
  
[color=#ff00ff][color=#00ffff]The Fairies can be crafted under the <Rings> section of the crafting tab.
  
  
[size=4]An optional .esp is available for those who want to possibly get these as a drop from fighting and killing Dragons.  They are considered a rare drop so don't expect one every time.  Thanks to AdenYeshua for making this.  It can be found under Optional files.  Just overwrite the .esp when prompted. A clean save is not necessary.  Just make sure to make a merged or bashed patch so these can be added to the leveled lists.

[color=#ffffff] [/color]**Description:**
  
This mod adds 9 varied beautiful glow fairies animated and equippables that can be enchanted.                            
  
All the fairies have custom "equip" and "unequip" effects sound, only Navi has a unique sound to equip it.
  
You can choose the one you like, each one has a name: **Lyru**, **Lawi**, **Dena**, **Vafi**, **Navi**, **Sial**, **Fewus**, **Suvi** and **Zeel**.
  
Can consider them lore-friendly as they are made by the Dwemer.

Final thoughts:
  
This seemed like an interesting idea as the Dwemer are a fascinating race of people.  I give credit to Onota for coming up with something different for players to use in their game and went with it.  Kudos to Onota for coming up with the original idea.  Please see 'permissions and credits' for information pertaining to the original mod.  Or you can look them up on the original mod page with the link I provided above. 
  
[/color][size=3]Please let me know if there is any issues with the file.  I will try and look at the post section every day for comments and criticisms.  Please keep in mind that I do work full time but I will always try and find time to answer questions and help out whenever I can.  Good luck to everyone and I hope you enjoy this port.[/size]
