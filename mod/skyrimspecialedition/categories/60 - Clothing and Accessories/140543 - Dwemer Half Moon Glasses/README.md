**What is this mod?**This mod adds a pair of simple dwemer styled half moon glasses, they are equipable by all vanilla races and crafted at a forge with 1 Dwarven Metal ingot. They take up the circlet slot (slot 42).
  
  
The glasses use vanilla textures so depending on your mods they might look different, for the example images I have used [Rally's Display Cases](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81764)﻿ for the lenses and [Ancient Dwemer Metal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/75610)﻿ for the dwemer automaton textures

  
  

**Known Issues**
  
  
There may be some clipping on certain face shapes depending on the nose, and maybe some of the more in depth race menu sliders. I tried for a happy middle ground where the glasses were not floating too far off the face but caused the least clipping. If you have the know how it is simple enough to make some small adjustments to the placement with outfit studio.
