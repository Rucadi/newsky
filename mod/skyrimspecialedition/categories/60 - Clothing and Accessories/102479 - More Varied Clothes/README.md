**﻿More Varied Clothes**Changes to several outfits to add variations and to include clothes from other mods to be used by NPCs randomly.
  
  
The included sets are:
  

  
* Farmer
Noble
  
* Merchant
Barkeeper
  
* Blacksmith
Miner
  
* Prisoner
Beggar
  

  
It also introduces sandals and bandages using vanilla assets, incorporated into certain sets.
  
  
**Compatibility**The original version includes patches for Prince and the Pauper and compatibility between add-ons. In case of conflicts with mods that touch the same records, load mine after.
  
  
The SkyPatcher version don't touch vanilla records, only resets the outfits and the items are injected using SkyPatcher. Any mod that touches the outfit's records will have their changes overridden by mine.
  
  
  
**Credits****sforzinda,** [Fashions of the Fourth Era](https://sforzmods.tumblr.com/sse_fashions) includes similar changes that were my inspiration for this mod. I also used some assets from her to add more variations, but if you want the complete collection of clothes, you can use her mod.
