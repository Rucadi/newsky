# Extended Amulet and Ring Pack
- Author: StratusWolf
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26377


This mod adds a total of 14 new jewelry pieces to craft.
  
  
Each new piece uses modified vanilla meshes, with existing gemstone colors matched from other pieces for accuracy. Prices have been calculated very carefully using a table of vanilla gold values, so you're getting the experience and money you deserve for your creations – no more, no less. And of course, female and male characters are fully supported.

Balancing
  
  
Crafting Materials: New rings use regular gemstones and new amulets use flawless gemstones.
  
  
Value: All of the gold values on the new items have been carefully calculated to reflect the values of vanilla amulets and rings, matching the sum of the ingot price, the gemstone price, and a flat delta value that is consistent across all metal-jewelry piece combinations.
