**Hello,
  
Finally, the complete mod with clothes from my wife Vayura is out.
  
 Created from scratch in Blender as always.
  
 Mod includes two ankle length dresses with unique HDT + accessories like belts, shoulder cloaks, corsets and bracelets.
  
There is also one pair of versatile leather boots. Maari's bikini is now included in this mod.
  
 Everything is craftable and color versions for dresses have been added.

New update : v2.2

  
* Added fluffy versions of fur coats
One piece of hip cloth (skirt) to go with the bikini
  
* possibility to choose in BS dresses that have no body physics (no bouncing)

  
Hi
  

  
* Huge update v3.3
    
  1. The dresses got a new coliseum model and the movement has been adjusted , it should be much smoother.[list]
Sometimes the body comes through with faster movements.
  

2. Serket Belt is now more metallic ( less deformation )

  
* A unique slider has also been added to change the size independently of the body.

3. Minor modification to the HDT Bikini Skirt

  
* Added Fluffy as an option

**﻿All of my outfit mods require a Bodyslide studio build as a first step.
  
Do you have and will you share the redhead's preset?
  
*Eresmet is a personal preset that I do not share.
  
  
My wife and I would like to thank [qIpdIb](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/qIpdIb/mods) for his contribution to our mod - a beautiful fluffy furry coat and dress hem.***
