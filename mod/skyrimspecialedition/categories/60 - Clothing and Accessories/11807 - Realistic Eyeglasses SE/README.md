\* OVERVIEW \*
  
   
This mod adds several eyeglasses in Skyrim game. Fully craftable, enchantable, lootable and buyable.
  
   
\* DESCRIPTION \*

  
   
The goal of this mod is to make "Realistic Eyeglasses" according to the Medieval-Fantasy style seen in Skyrim, even if it's Norse actually.
  
The eyeglasses, in real life, are a quite old invention of the mankind, since the Medieval Era. I made the design similar to that kind of eyeglasses.
  
These Eyeglasses can be crafted at any forge under Jewerly section. Slot used: 44.

After 48 in-game hours from installation mod, the merchants will start to sell eyeglasses, especially the court mages. Some are already enchanted with vanilla enchantement like Fortify Health, Fortify Alteration, etc.
  
There is also one kind of special eyeglasses with unique enchantement: Eyeglasses of Night Eye. These eyeglasses gives you the ability of Night Vision when equipped and it's better than Khajiiti or Werewolf Night Vision. And yes, you can disenchant it and learn the enchantement.

Eyeglasses can be found in loot also, including chests and hostile mages but only on the next respawn cycle of the dungeon/area. Hostile mages, vampires on the road in open space may have eyeglasses in their inventory on sight.

Make sure to unequip any eyeglasses first and then uninstall the mod, especially if you use enchanted ones.
