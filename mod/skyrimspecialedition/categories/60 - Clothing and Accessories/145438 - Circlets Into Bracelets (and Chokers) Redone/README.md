# Circlets Into Bracelets (and Chokers) Redone

**What's the same as my other mod?**
  
? These still use slots 58/59
  
? They still come in all the same color combinations, just tweaked a bit to account for the new meshes
  
? They'll still work with female or male
  
? They should work with whatever body you're using, as long as the size adjustment isn't beyond the "normal" bounds
  
? They're still craftable at the forge
  
? They're still in a few of the smaller Leveled Lists
  
? These still have no armor rating, but are enchantable
  
? Still requires Dawnguard DLC because of the Aetherium bracelet
  
**Newly added in version 1.3**
  
? They now require you to craft a book in order to see the recipes! Craftable at the tanning rack w/charcoal and a roll of paper. Keep in your inventory to see recipes, and store it elsewhere when you don't! Yay!
  
\*an optional patch was made for the chokers, since there aren't as many\*
  
  
  
**So.... What's different about this version?**
  
? I've done some necessary editing on the meshes
  
? I've added separate meshes for the ebony styles this time - *which is one reason why this is a standalone file and not just an update to the older mod.*
  
? I have made *ALL NEW* gemstone textures from images of *REAL* stones. These still aren't perfect, but I do think they're better than vanilla.
  
? I have made *ALL NEW* cubemaps to fit my appearance preferences. 
  
? I've included 1st person view into the file, which will conflict with mods like Imperious (I'll add a patch asap). 
  
? I've changed a few of the crafting recipes and added them into the file.
  
? I've renamed the files/folder and the plugin. 
  
  

*⚠️Please report any issues you come across so I can attempt to fix them.⚠️*

Memorandum:
  
*I do not use an ENB or CS,**therefore I do not know how these will look on setups that do use them. Everything I have edited and/or made for these is based off of a setup using Azurite Weathers, RLO and KreatE. Thus, my work will likely look different in your game.
  
If you want to provide some screenshots so others can see what they look like with ENB, then please do so. 
  
[i]I did this for my game and shared it for others like myself, so*I will not put in extra effort to make these fit high end setups. I'm sorry if that's not good enough for you, and that I'm not some grand modder. But no worries, this is that last I'll be sharing, and you have plenty of other folks who can provide what you want. Cheers.[/i]
