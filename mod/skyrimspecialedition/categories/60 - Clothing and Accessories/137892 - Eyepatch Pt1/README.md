[Pt2 is now released!!!](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/160758) 2 New eyepatches and a Dwemer monocle
  
  
I noticed eyepatch mods were non-existent so I decided to create some.
  
  
There are versions for both the left and right eye, both male and female, all races, and all can be **crafted at a forge**If you are playing on a downgraded (older) version of Skyrim, you will need [this](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441) 
  
  
If you want them integrated and added to various NPCs, you can download [this](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/143199?tab=description)
  
**The 3 eyepatches in this mod include**:
  
  
**Labourer's Eyepatch** - Just a simple leather eyepatch inspired by real life ones
  
1 leather strip, 1 leather
  
  
**Sin'Dorei Eyepatch** - From the [Lor'Themar Armory](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/103538) mod which I helped create, inspired by a World of Warcraft 'Blood Elf' character (named Lor'themar)
  
1 leather strip, 1 refined malachite ingot
  
  
**Havi's Eyepatch** - Inspired by Assassin's Creed Valhalla, it is the eyepatch Havi (Odin the AllFather) wears in the game
  
1 leather strip, 1 gold ingot
  
  
They count as clothing and grant no armor rating to least interfere with any armor related perks 
  
  
They take up the slot 55 which is labelled for face jewellery, meaning it could be worn with a helmet at the same time
  
  
ESL Flagged
  
  
Each sex of each race has a custom mesh to adapt to the variations in eye placements, however if you make your characters eyes veer far from the race's typical position, then it may begin to clip, unfortunately I am not aware of a way to have the model naturally move along with your face design/ expression
  
  
This is just a pre-release for a larger eyewear collection. I have had these for a while but got busy with life so I never shared them. I have two more on the way, one Dragonscale inspired and one Dwemer style monocle. I decided I would just publish these 3 for now and the others should arrive sometime in the future and I will also integrate them into the game, having some one eyed characters wear them and perhaps some enemies like bandits too!

I would like to thank Kredans for his help throughout my entire learning process, none of this would have happened without his help
  
  
This is my first real attempt at making full models from scratch, and is somewhat also meant to be a learning process for me to eventually develop more complex pieces like full armour sets
  
  
NOTE: I had an issue where my storage failed so I have unfortunately lost all the blender and substance painter files, so I cannot really make any significant aesthetic alterations now, apologies
