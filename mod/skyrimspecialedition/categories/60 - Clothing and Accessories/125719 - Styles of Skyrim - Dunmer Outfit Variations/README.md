**Styles of Skyrim Series**

  
The goal of this series is to greatly increase the color variety of Skyrim's NPC clothing in a lore-friendly manner. All the mods in this series are built from the ground up with compatibility in mind. These mods utilize Skypatcher for distribution and mod compatibility patching, with the goal of being as 'plug and play' as possible. Enjoy an expanded catalogue of immersive new clothing colors!
  
  

**2.0 update!**

  
All textures have been completely redone, full credit to [Xavbio](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/xavbio?gameId=1704)! This series will now have complete aesthetic consistency with Xavbio's [Common Clothing Retexture SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/142188), it is a soft requirement and highly recommended. Skypatcher is now mandatory for functionality, I have discontinued the esp edit version. This will make future patches (if necessary) easier for me to handle as well.
  
  
  
**Dunmer Outfit Variations**Adds two new mix and match variants for each Dunmer Outfit (yellow, red and blue). Hooded and unhooded variants included. Two new color variants of the Dunmer shoes. Any NPC wearing the outfits can now randomly spawn with the new color varieties.
  
  
Enjoy less repetitive outfits when used with mods that distributes the outfits to Skyrim Dunmers such as  [Dunmeri Outfits for Skyrim Dunmers (SPID)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48261). 
  
  
Refer to images for edited outfits records. Or grab the Skypatcher version which contains zero vanilla edits!
  
  
**IMPORTANT**: [WACCF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18994) users please grab the provided patch for whichever version you are using. Without the patch you may have naked NPCs!
  
  
As always suggestions on improvements are appreciated :)
