I cannot describe how happy it makes me to know that [PraedythXVI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/15641579) not only replaced Potema's Skull with their [Unique Skulls HD - SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52073)mod, but also gave her an unique crown and it is wearable. What a legend, Potema is also one of the most fascinating characters in Skyrim. So I will definetly be wearing her crown in all my playthroughs.
  
  
**INSTALLATION:**
  
Download the *Unique Skulls HD - SE* mod and then just overwrite their files with mine. I only edited the meshes, should be compatible with which ever texture size you choose to use.
  
  
**MOD COMPONENTS:**
  

  
* Refitted for Female head: Done and using [Female head Reference For Outfit Studio (Modders Resource)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73118) as a base and edited the crown nif using [Outfit Studio](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/201) . The female head reference, was designed for High Poly head 1.4, but the head isn't part of the nif. So the crown should work with low poly vanilla head and Charmers of the reach too. Maybe, let me know if you encounter any problems.
Refitted for Male head (Same process, used the malehead nif from [High Poly Head 1.4](https://vectorplexis.com/files/file/283-high-poly-head/)﻿ as reference.)
  
* Refitted for Khajiit and Argonian head and added them to the game (Same process, used the beat head nifs also found inside High Poly Head 1.4 as reference), the original mod gave them normal gold circlets. Made a small esp with [SSEEdit](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/164)﻿﻿, that is esl flagged that gives beast races actual Potema crowns.

  
**FUTURE UPDATES:**

  
* ~~Refit crown for male head (Just need to find a male head reference.)~~ DONE!
~~Refit crown for beasts heads (Most armor I have dealt with, only have male and female head nifs. I will have to not only find beast head references but also figure out how to save the nif and have them show up in game. Based on what I know, I think might be required me to edit the Unique skull esp to add beast versions of the crown with keywords. Never done that before, so this may take awhile.)~~ DONE!
  
* Equippable Potema crown for werewolves, she is the wolf queen after all. (Will not be easy, since you cannot actually equip stuff on werewolves. Maybe I can use immersive display somehow. Will release Potema crown for werewolves when I figure out how.)
Potema's crown for dogs and huskies (Will make when I figure out how.)
  
* Still want more, ok how about... a throwable Potema crown projectile that comes back to you like a captain America shield. (I saw someone made something like that, maybe it is possible. Just need to figure out, how.)

Love this community, started of modding and then I learnt to edit mod plugins, now to edit meshs, hopefully in the future I will learn how to apply textures and edit scripts to make my own code based mods. To gain skills, to maybe create develop my own games :) (Yes, I have big dreams. Laugh if you want.)
