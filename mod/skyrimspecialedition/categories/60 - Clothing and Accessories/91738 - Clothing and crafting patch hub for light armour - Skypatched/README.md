# Clothing and crafting patch hub for light armour - Skypatched

- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/91738


This is a patch hub to convert light armour to clothing type, add crafting recipes and make crafting recipes easier, for selected light armours. From v2.0, mostly now esp-less thanks to the magic of Skypatcher!
  
  
I often like to play as a mage, or have mage followers. There are a ton of great light armour mods out there which look amazing but I wished were clothing rather than armour. The problem is that using light armour is both unimmersive for the hardcore mage, gets OP when using Ironskin or suchlike, plus the armour keywords prevent benefits from Robes or Clothing based perks in mods such as Adamant or Vokrii.
  
  
This hub patches clothing for female players or followers. If there is interest in patching male/unisex armours to clothing then I can look at that.
  
It's made for CBBE/3BA type mods as listed in the Requirements. It will work for BHUNP and other body types only if the original esp has not been renamed.
  
  
1. CONVERT LIGHT ARMOUR TO CLOTHING (Skypatched)
  
This is designed to be a patch hub with a FOMOD selector which finds (selected) light armour mods and adds .esl flagged patches which convert their armour characteristics into clothing.
  

  
* Armour rating is reduced to zero
Often reduced the weight of each item to match clothing
  
* Clothing Keywords added and Armour Keywords removed
Some items made unenchantable to nerf cheating.
  

  
2. ADD CRAFTING RECIPES (uses esp patches)
  
The hub also contains crafting patches for certain mods which don't already have them. No more using AddConsole needed! For the mods with massive lists of pieces, a book must be crafted (at the tanning rack) and be in your inventory to bring up the crafting options.
  
\*\*Note that Skypatcher cannot add crafting recipes for mods which don't already have them. Therefore these all use esl-flagged esps.
  
  
3. EASIER CRAFTING RECIPES (Skypatched)
  
Lastly there are some "easier crafting" patches for some armour mods where I felt the recipes were too difficult to acquire, making it an end-game armour when we want to be using it early or mid game.
  
  
No other changes are made.
  
  
**Requires Skypatcher to be installed and any original mods you want patching as masters** - make sure you hit endorse or leave a nice message for the mod authors. Some of the off-site ones might be pay-gated, I don't know.
