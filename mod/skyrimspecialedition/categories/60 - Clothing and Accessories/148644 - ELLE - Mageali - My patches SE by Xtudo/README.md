MAGEALI
  
Author Ellxe - My patches by Xtudo****Description**
  
**My patches and tweaks for the beautiful armor mod made by Ellxe.****Tweaks and Edits
  
It will replace [ELLE] Mageali.esp.** It's fine to update mid-game, you won't lose any already crafted item.
  

  
* Added proper footstep sounds to the boots.
Fixed weapon adjust on all items.
  
* Fixed boots inventory item rotation.
Carried on the fixes from the Unofficial Patch to the Moorside Inn cell (where the crafting manual is located).
  
* Added "Warm" keyword for the Survival Mode .
Removed tempering recipes, since all items are clothing.
  
* Removed ArmorBoots keyword from boots.
Removed ArmorBody from the breastbands.
  
* Removed ArmorGauntlets from the wrist wraps.
Renamed all items for a more lore-friendly feeling. Ex.: "[E] Mageali Bra 3" to "Mageali Breastband Amethyst".
  
* **Light Armor Addon version.** Adds extra light armored versions of the main items. It's fine to install/switch to this version mid-game, you won't lose any already crafted item. Install only one of the Main Files.

  
**Optional files**

  
* **Underwear Addon.** Build your BodySlide for the **Underwear** after installing it.
