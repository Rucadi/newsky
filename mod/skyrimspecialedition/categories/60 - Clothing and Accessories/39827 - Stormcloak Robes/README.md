Although [GustavL](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/5546277) is not that active anymore, he did granted me a generous permission to convert his Stormcloak Robes mod to Skyrim SE.
  
The mod has been cleaned with Tesseditcleaner 4.0.x
  
  
All credits, endorsements, love and support for the mod, belong to [GustavL](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/5546277) not me!!
  
  
NOTE: this conversion was done by request of a fan, I have not tested this ingame, as this mod uses the vanilla body. However I do like the idea and once I get skilled enough, I want to convert this to CBBE with bodyslide.. possibly with 3bbb support as [GustavL](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/5546277) has given me permission to do this as well.
  
  
  
The following was copied from his original site: <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/27378>*Gone are the days when you had to choose between wearing mage gear and representin' your crew. Secede in style with these new Stormcloak-themed Robes.*

INTRODUCTION
  
  
This is the frequently asked-for sequel to my Imperial Legion Robes mod, and its way better. My previous mod was a hit on the Workshop but a total flop here. Hope it works out better this time.
  
  
I hope you all agree that my skills have improved since last time. I would really like to hear what you think: What could I improve in this mod? What should I think about for my next mod? I prefer everything I do to be a learning experience, and since many of you guys are a lot more experienced with modding than I am, you could be a great help.
  
  
FEATURES
  
  
This mod adds six new garments to them game:
  
  
- The Stormcloak Volunteer Robes and Stormcloak Volunteer Hood, which are based on the Novice Robes and hood from the main game and have identical stats to those, plus a 30% bonus to stamina regen on the robes, which will help with both the hitting and the running.
  
  
- The Stormcloak Sage Robes, which come in five exciting flavours; one for each school of magic. Their stats are the same as 'Expert Robes of [Magic School]', with the above discussed 30% Stamina regen bonus. There is also an unenchanted version called 'Rebel Robes.'
  
  
- The Stormcloak Ivory Boots and Stormcloak Ivory Bracers, which are merely cloth versions of the Stormcloak Officer Boots and Bracers for those who use the 'Mage Armor' perk.
  
  
- The Stormcloak Seeker Shawl, which is the equivalent of the 'Imperial Battlemage Hood' from my Imperial Legion Robes mod. It is intended to be worn with armor and gives a 40% bonus to magicka regeneration. There is also an unenchanted version called 'Rebel Shawl.'
  
  
All of it can be bought from Oengul War-Anvil, castle blacksmith of Windhelm, or from any of the Quartermasters in the Stormcloak war camps across Skyrim. However, just like the Expert Robes from the vanilla game, the Stormcloak Sage Robes and Stormcloak Seeker Shawl can only be purchased after your character reaches level 24.
  
  
Unlike my previous mod, these textures are primarily "hand drawn", with only some minor details recoloured. Textures were taken from free texture sites and copy-pasted from the Stormcloak Armor and Stormcloak Officer armor to make sure the robes have a similar feel. The design of the Volunteer Robes is based on the Stormcloak Cuirass and the design of the Sage Robes is based on the the Stormcloak Officer Armor.
  
  
The mod includes no meshes, so it should be compatible with any body- or clothing replacer you might use.
  
  
TREASURE HUNT
  
  
Introduced in version 1.1 of the mod is a new version of the Volunteer Robes with unique stats and a unique texture. I hid it in a place that seemed suitable from a lore standpoint. Here are the clues:
  
  

  
* They belonged to a Stormcloak who was killed sometime before the beginning of the game.
They are hidden in an end table in her room in her family home.
  

  
If you have been chatty with Skyrim's populace you might know who the Stormcloak in question is. If you don't know who it is, some detective work is in order. Happy hunting!
  
  
CHANGE LOG
  
  
Version 1.11 Now converted correctly, so it should be working in SE
  
  
Version 1.1 - December 2, 2012

  
* Added the treasure hunt (see above.)
Added an unenchanted version of the Seeker Shawl, called 'Rebel Shawl' for sale from Oengul (I forgot to add it to the Quartermasters, sorry.)
  
* Updated the normal maps on the Sage Robes. The fur should look a bit more 3D now. As an unfortuante side effect, the female ground model looks a bit funky, but it looks great when worn.

  
KNOWN ISSUES
  
  

  
* Texture problems with the hoods on Argonians and Khajiit. The hoods do work, but they show the regular mage hood texture. I haven't figured out how to do proper beast race support yet; hopefully I'll crack it.
The Rebel Shawl is not for sale from the Stormcloak quartermasters.
  

  
Installation: 
  
Mod Organizer 2 (highly recommended)
  
Manual installation: you should know where to put it, although I do not recommend it, as it is very common that mod tend to overwrite each other and can make your game corrupt, so don't expect any support or assistance in that matter.
  
  
Bugs/issues:
  
-This conversion was done out of a request by a fan of the mod. I did not test this mod ingame, Because it uses the Vanilla body. It should be working as intended by the Author without any bugs or issues, besides the ones mentioned in the description above. However if you do find something that is not as how it should be, please mention this in the comment section and I will see what I can do about it.
  
  
  
-Compability issues:
  
Because this mod uses, the vanilla body from within skyrim itself, there are no meshes present. This also mean if you want to use this mod, and you have an armor/clothing rerplaces in your game that have it's own meshes, the mod will try to use those meshes, but will result in a game CTD. I have no solution for this, as I have been unable to find a way to create it's own meshes. I did ask the Author to recreate the mod, but this time with meshes, however it may be unlikely that this will ever happen, since the author [GustavL](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/5546277) is not active on the Nexus anymore.
