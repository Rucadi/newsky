﻿With permission from [J0suk3](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/J0suk3/about-me?gameId=1704), here is a add-on for the excellent [J3 Royal Vampire 3BA SMP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/128690?tab=posts)﻿.
  
  
It is a **hard requirement** for this one.

**So what this mod do:**
  
  
- **Does not edit the original mod** in any way.
  
  
- **Adds a new item**, that uses slot 32, based on the Corset of the original mod.
  
= esp included (Light)
  
  
- It has "Realistic" (firm corset) physics, and optional breast squeeze sliders.
  
  
  
Reasoning for adding new item instead of doing this with the existing corset,
  
below in the spoiler;
  
  
Spoiler
  
To be able to do the squeeze body with weighed physics, with a piece of armor or cloth,
  
they have to be in the same mesh file with the body.
  
  
Traditionally this is slot 32 "Body" item. So I had to change the slot for the corset, to pull this off.
  
If I would had done with just editing the original, it could not be used with the shirts, since they would use same slot then.
  
  
As a side note, the shirts can't be used with this one (also it would cause clipping since the models would not match),
  
since they use now same slot. The cardigan can be used with this still, refer to the bodyslots in picture below)
  
  
So it was better to just add new item to the game, and leave the original untouched.

*Royal Vampire Corset Top* is the new item.
  
﻿As a side note, armor value is same as with the shirts.
  
Took this picture before changing the armor value.

**Installation:**
  
You can find this in Bodyslide by searching:
  
*[J3] RV Corset Squeeze*
  
  
**No squeeze:**
  
  
- Build in Bodyslide.
  
  
Done.
  
**Squeeze:**
  
  
- Adjust the extra sliders to your liking,
  
do this for **both, weight 0 and 100**- Build in Bodyslide.**Done.**(gif might take a bit to load)**![](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/53988626968_f54ed9cc1d_o.gif)﻿**
  
  
Extra tips for building:
  
- Press T in the preview window to hide textures.
  
- Press W to enable Wireframe.
  
- You can go for *values over 100, or negative values* with the sliders, if you type in the value.
  
- After building it first time, you can re-build the top while in-game, just re-equip it to see the new built item.
  
-Remember to adjust sliders for both, 0 and 100.
  
  
As a last mention, previews have smp on for breast physics,
  
your mileage might differ depending on your physics setup.
  
I might add different bone weight options later.
  
  
That is about it, simple mod.
