* With just the main mod installed, the outfit can be crafted at the forge with the Elven Smithing perk.
If you have the optional add-on installed for CC "The Cause", you must first find a unique enchanted version of the outfit in the Ayleid ruin of Rielle before it can be crafted at the forge.

**Q: Is this mod compatible with X body mod?**
  
**A:** The currently available body types are listed under "Features".
  
**Q: Is this outfit rigged for physics, like SMP or HDT?**
  
**A:** Nope, but if you want to make a conversion, please feel free, as long as this mod is a required masterfile.
  
  
**Q: Can I create a conversion of this for X body mod or SMP/HDT?**
  
**A:** Absolutely, as long as this mod is required as a masterfile!
  
  
**Q: Can you make X change to the outfit model? Pretty please?**
  
**A:** Nope. These files are years old and I don't have the original models any more. It's as-is.
