This mod adds **over 15 unique bikini armor sets**, each with multiple interchangeable pieces—just like **TAWOBA**—to bring more variety to your Skyrim wardrobe.
  
  
Instead of using the same outfits repeatedly, characters such as **vampires, warlocks, and NPCs** can now wear a variety of modular armor sets (In a future mod). The following outfits are done based on the vanilla counterpart.

  
* **Farmer Clothes** (4 sets + 3 variations)
**Forsworn Armor**
  
* **Dark Brotherhood Armor & Clothes**
**Mage Robes** (Novice, Apprentice, Adept, Expert, Master)
  
* **Monk Robes** (Standard, Blue, Vaermina, Warlock robes – all recolored versions of the same armor)
**Cultist Robes**
  
* **Guard Armor** (Includes versions for all 9 holds plus universal clothing)
**Vampire Clothes**
  

**Armor Parts & Customization**
  
Most sets come with multiple modular pieces, allowing for **custom outfit combinations**:
  

  
* **Bikini Tops** (2 styles)
**Bikini Bottoms** (2 styles)
  
* **Belts / Abs Guards** (2 styles)
**Boots** (2 styles)
  
* **Chest Guards** (1 piece)
**Circlets / Hats** (Varies by outfit)
  
* **Masks / Blindfolds** (1 piece)
**Gloves** (2 styles)
  
* **Chokers / Neck Accessories** (2 styles)
**Pauldrons / Sleeves** (2 styles)
  
* **Back Guards / Spines** (Not all sets include these)
**Skirts / Tassets** (2 styles)
  
* **Garters / Thigh Accessories** (2 styles)

**Requirements & Compatibility**
  
This mod **requires**:
  

  
* **3BA**
**BodySlide**
  

Since this mod uses Skyrim’s **base textures**, any **texture replacers** installed will automatically apply to the bikini armor sets, seamlessly integrating them into your world.
  
  
This mod will be the only bikini mod I will update, so [Farmer Bikini](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/148171), [Forsworn Bikini](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/148615) and [Vampire Bikini](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/148618) will not be updated because they are already in this mod.
  
  
**Additional Details & Future Updates**
  
**Current Clothing & Meshes**
  

  
* Some outfits, **mostly hats, hoods, and boots**, are **high-poly versions of vanilla clothing**. These will likely be placeholders until more unique designs are added.
**All clothing is craftable**, allowing full customization through Skyrim’s crafting system.
  
* The meshes were either **created from scratch using Blender** or assembled from parts of vanilla clothing to maintain Skyrim’s aesthetic.

**Planned Future Updates**
  

  
* **More sets** to expand outfit variety.
**Additional clothing parts** for further customization.
  
* **Refinement of existing pieces**, replacing items that aren’t up to standard.
**Fixing male compatibility issues** to ensure proper integration for male characters, like the missing parts bug
  

**What This Mod Will NOT Include**
  

  
* This mod **will not replace NPC clothing** in vanilla Skyrim, I will done that on other mod to be more organized
    
  be more organized
A **separate mod** will be created for NPC clothing changes, which will include additional vanilla armor replacements.
  
* Male body parts sometimes have **missing meshes**, requiring further adjustments. Because of this, the NPC clothing replacement will be handled in a **different mod** to properly resolve these issues.
