This is something which I had made for myself bit by bit over the last year.  Since it has become quite extensive, and [the original mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60901)﻿ has open permissions, I decided to share it.  Enjoy an earring filled Skyrim!

* Earrings have been placed on leveled lists so they should appear as loot and in shops which sell jewelry.  In Whiterun, Fralia's inventory has been boosted to make it more likely for her to sell various earrings.  She will always sell matching sets.
Dozens of specific and generic NPC outfits have been edited to include the earrings.  Some outfits will always use matching sets (usually townspeople) and some get the left and right earrings randomly (for example, bandits).  Some characters will always be wearing earrings, and for others it's a random chance.  Some characters will never wear earrings.
  
* Earrings have been given new names that sit better among other inventory items.  For example, *Pierced Ears 01 Rings Left* has been renamed to *Earring, Steel Helix (Left)*
The Christian cross earrings have *not* been integrated, but are still available for crafting.  They've been named "Icon" earrings.
  
* Many helmets, hoods, and hats have been edited so that they will no longer remove the right earring when equipped.  It should be possible to wear any headgear and keep your earrings on.
Likewise, many more helmets, hoods, and hats have been edited so that both earrings are either correctly visible or correctly invisible when worn.  This solves issues of the earrings clipping through hoods, or invisible when wearing helmets with the ears exposed, such as the iron helmet, or cases where the left earring is visible but the right is not.
  
* The left ear has been changed from slot 55 to slot 60, to avoid conflicts with both Wearable Lanterns and Bandolier - Bags and Pouches. Equipping a lantern will no longer remove your earring!
Forwards survival tags from Update.esm and fixes from USSEP.

xXTainXx's port of Nostromo79's mod, [Pierced Ears - Earrings SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13571)﻿, is required, as this mod contains only a plugin, not any of the earring assets. Once installed, the plugin **NosPiercedEarsAll.esp** should be disabled, removed, or if you're on Mod Organizer 2, set to hidden. Once that's done, download and install this mod, and you're all set!
  
  
If you've already been using Pierced Ears - Earrings SE, the earrings you already have will vanish.  If you want them back, you can use [this guide](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/1371).

* This mod has been made to be fully compatible with [Bandolier](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2417)﻿ and [Wearable Lanterns](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7560)﻿.
Due to the changes to headgear to allow the earrings to be worn correctly, patches for the following mods are included:  [WACCF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18994)﻿, [Armor and Clothing Extension](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19002) (ACE), [Zim's Immersive Artifacts](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9138)﻿ (ZIA), [Improved Closefaced Helmets](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/824)﻿ (ICH), [Guard Armor Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22671) (GAR), and [aMidianBorn Content Addon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/24909).
  
* **Important:**  The included WACCF-ICH merged patch is for the *[WACCF Version of ICH](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19518)﻿.*  It will not work with the standard version of ICH.  The installer will not know the difference.
[Armor and Clothing Extension](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19002)'s library of new outfits has been patched so that NPCs who would be wearing earrings without it are still wearing earrings with it.
  
* Due to the changes to leveled lists, patches for the following mods are included: [Economy Overhaul and Speechcraft Improvements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9542)﻿, and [Scarcity](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8647)﻿.
Here are some guidelines for the load order for the patches.  
  

  
1. ﻿If you have multiple WACCF patches installed, load the WACCF-ZIA patch last.
﻿Any patch for GAR must be loaded after any patch for ICH.
  
2. If you're using the WACCF-GAR patch, load the WACCF-GAR-NEI patch last.
Load the ACE patch after all WACCF patches.

**Q: By moving the slot to 60, won't it conflict with other mods?**
  
Yes, totally!  Any change to it is a risk, but my goal was to make the earrings work with Bandolier and Lanterns, so I made the call.
  
  
**Q: Why fully replace [b]NosPiercedEarsAll.esp rather than patching it?**[/b]
  
The original plugin is a standard ESP file.  This one is an ESP-FE.  By replacing the plugin, it will free up a load order slot for you.
  
  
**Q: Will you make a patch for XYZ?**
  
Maybe!  However, I'd rather teach you how to [make the patch yourself](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/1371).  If you do, I can share it here!
  
  
**Q: The headgear fix doesn't work on something!**
  
If it's a problem with a vanilla, WACCF, or ACE headgear, I'll update the mod. If it's from another mod, I can help you [make the patch yourself](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/1371) and then host it here.
  
  
**Q: I disagree with a choice you made!**
  
I'll try to teach you how to edit the mod yourself so you can change it to your liking. :)
  
  
**Q: Will you port this to Oldrim?**
  
I am not set up for Oldrim modding, however, if anyone is so inclined, you should absolutely feel free to take a stab at making an Oldrim version and releasing it.
  
  
**Q: Will you do more work on this?**
  
As I made this for my own personal use and am just releasing it because I like sharing, I don't intend for this to become a big ongoing project. I have my own projects to obsess over! So if there's any desire for other edits or changes, I encourage you to do as I did; learn how to mod and bring those ideas to the world. :)
