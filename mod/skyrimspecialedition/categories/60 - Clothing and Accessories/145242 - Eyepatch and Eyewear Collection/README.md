**﻿What is this mod?**
  
Once again this mod started out as an extra little something I made for Raynes but immediately got out of hand.This mod is a small collection of eyepatches and other eye wear for the player and optionally for distribution to NPCs. All items included support all vanilla races, and I've done my best to make sure they fit as many face shapes as possible. They were shaped with Vanilla and High Poly Head in mind so should work fine on either.
  
  
All items take up Slot 55 and come in left and right variants where suitable, they are craftable at a forge and some items can optionally be found on named NPCs or randomly among bandits. For the named NPC distribution I have attempted to give the patches out only where suitable, such as to characters who have a blind eye or an eye scar, but there are a few others just to add a little flavour.

**Known Issues**
  
  
Some of the patches may clip on certain face shapes, this is unavoidable. I have adjusted the models many times to try and make them clip as little as possible, but I cannot cover every possible shape. This may be worse on the Khajiit/Argonian meshes as they are a more awkward shape, there will most likely be some clipping with certain Argonian horn styles.
  
  
**Requirements**
  
  
SPID is required for the option distribution file. The patches use mostly vanilla textures with the exception of a few (the black leather patch and the assassin patches) so their appearance will vary largely on your installed textures. I recommend Xavbio's [Thieves Guild Armors Retexture](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98561)﻿ at least.

Xavbio for a few textures from their Thieves Guild Armors retexture and Bonemold Weapons and Armors retexture.
