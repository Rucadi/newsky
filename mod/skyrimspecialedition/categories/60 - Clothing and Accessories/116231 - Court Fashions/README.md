# Court Fashions

I like variety and there isn't much of that to spare in vanilla Skyrim. The courts of the Jarls are very important in Skyrim, containing some key movers and shakers, but one thing I can't get over is the recycling of the same clothing without much to differentiate the wealthy and powerful. For 'immersion', I need to believe that they have a bit of individuality and so I have taken a variety of open source outfits and distributed them in (I hope) a logical way to reflect the personalities of those affected which I will detail below. I like to think this is fairly vanilla+; nothing skimpy or outrageous here I am afraid. Those already wearing suitable gear like the Jarls and various servants haven't been touched, nor their generic guards.
  
  
Most outfits are not added to levelled lists or craftable (The housecarl armours and noble Nord are craftable), this is just to provide some spice of life to otherwise uninterestingly garbed individuals  - all pieces are fully functional and have beast race support where applicable if you get a bit stabby stabby or pickpocket them (or additem menu/console). Many of the outfits use vanilla textures so visuals will depend on your set up. 
  
  
First and foremost, CREDITS. I did not make these assets and have relied entirely upon the generous open permissions of various authors as follows:
  
  
**SFORZINDA** - This talented individual has made a great collection of clothing and armours that fit very naturally into the game. A large (read huge) percentage of the assets came from their work - please drop by their blog and say thank you. The mods can also be downloaded from here and I highly recommend them! [sforz makes mods (tumblr.com)](https://sforzmods.tumblr.com/sse)[NordwarUA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/53732701) - A true heavyweight in the Skyrim modding community.

Credits for this at the bottom as there are a fair few.

TLDR; Many outfits to many NPCS - I didn't make them. Give kudos and endorsements to those that did. 
  
  
If you are prepared for a wall of text and have nothing better to do then read on. 
  
  
Now the substantial list of NPCs affected, what they are wearing and my reasoning (in no particular order):
  
  
**Whiterun - An important and wealthy hold.**
  
Proventus - A bit full of himself, I gave him a clothing set that reflects both the fact that he is an imperial, and a bit self-important. 
  
Hrongar - Brother of the Jarl wearing some cheapo armour? I think not. Now he wears armour befitting his station.
  
Farengar - I don't really see him as a mage per se, he himself admits to never leaving Dragonsreach. I think of him more as a wealthy scholar and he is bedecked accordingly. 
  
Irileth - A 'nightblade' according to her class. I thought something a bit more rougeish was in order with hints of her Elven heritage. 
  
Nazeem - If this pompous ass was made of chocolate he'd eat himself - I imagine the urge to out-fashion everyone would be hard to resist so now he wears some pretty expensive clobber. 
  
**Solitude - A grand court so lets do something about it.**Falk Fire-Beard - Something a little bit grander for the Steward of arguably the grandest hold in Skyrim. 
  
Bolgeir Bear-Claw - Still rocking Steel Plate, but now with a little bit more pomp. Robes don't just have to be for mages. 
  
Sybille Stentor - A new outfit that subtly hints at her dirty little secret without being overly in your face (anything is better than those generic mage robes).
  
Erikur - I doubt he would take being out-fashioned by his sister so now he wears a semi-matching set.
  
Melaran - A mage just trying to keep his head down and enjoy the good life - now more scholarly and upmarket. 
  
**Mortha****l - A poor hold - the outfits chosen reflect this.**
  
Aslfur - Morthal may be a poor hold, but he is still husband to the Jarl. Now he has something a bit warmer and grander to reflect his position. 
  
Idgrod (the younger) - A down-to-earth young woman, who appears to take a keen interest in potions. Now she wears something vaguely alchemisty. 
  
Gorm - A new cuirass to provide a bit more protection on a budget. 
  
**Winterhold - A struggling 'City' - cash strapped.**Malur Sleoth - I rather think a conman would dress up a bit as he tries to play the part of a steward. New clothing that is a bit more mysterious (for the locals at least).
  
Thaena - Wife of the Jarl and Housecarl to boot. Why is she wearing a common farm dress? Would that really be a happy marriage if Korir decked himself out in furs whilst she shivered?
  
Kraldar - A potential Jarl if the Empire wins. New furred outfit that won't look out of place if he sits on the throne. 
  
**Dawnstar - Not much here and a fairly sparse court.**Madena - A Breton mage who abhors violence following something of a killing spree. Blue robes that look a bit like something someone in Dawnstar might obtain from a certain someone. Mainly to add a bit of variety. 
  
**Windhelm - Not much again. Most characters are already wearing outfits appropriate to their station.**Wuunfeth the Unliving - A character of dark reputation with a spicy name wears.........the same boring mage robes as everyone else. Now more of a shaman vibe.
  
**Falkreath- still a bit quiet**Nenya - A high elf just trying to navigate difficult times to the best of her ability. Wearing clothing that is a bit more elven and grand. 
  
Helvard - Housecarl who could have a bad time if it comes to that. With his new clobber he may take more of a bea(r)ting. 
  
**Riften - Now we're talking**Unmid - A proud Nord and Stormcloak supporter so naturally he wears.....Elven armor? That's a good way to get killed by your own side in a battle. Not anymore with a bit of a Nord Beserker vibe.
  
Harrald - Spoilt brat would definitely get some top notch stuff for himself. 
  
Anuriel - Similar to Nenya, elven steward finery. 
  
Wylandriah - Subtle robes that reflect her eccentric nature. 
  
**Markarth - A court in turmoil**Calcelmo - An eccentric Dwemer obsessed mage now with Dwemer themed robes. 
  
Aicantar - Calcelmo's nephew - kind of the same but apprenticeesque. 
  
Thongvor - A scion of an incredibly wealthy family wears bog-standard steel armour? No more.
  
Faleen - Took a bit of creative liberty here considering she specialises in heavy gear. Now wearing light armour reflecting her Redguard heritage. 
  
Raerek - A pragmatist trying to ensure Igmund stays on his throne - now he is wearing hybrid elven and imperial gear to ingratiate himself with the Thalmor 'guests'.
  
Ondolemar - Thalmor are not exactly shy, rubbing their finery in the face of the Nords is presumably part of his remit as an emissary. 
  
**Bonus**
  
Ancano - Wears the same as Ondolemar because I thought it fitted him perfectly.
