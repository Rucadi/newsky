**Crafting**
  
You can craft all of these at tanning racks. To not overload your crafting menu, you can only craft things you have the "main" component. What this is will vary by what you are trying to craft. For example, if you have an animal pelt, you can craft a standard cloak of that animal type. If you have two animal pelts, you can craft a heavy cloak. If you have a standard cloak, you can craft a short version of it, or trimmed version of it.
