**RIVERFOLK CLOTHES**

**My patches by Xtudo**

**Description**
  
**My patches for this amazing mod.**
  

  
* Added **Light Armor** version. Similar stats than vanilla Fur Armor. Both armor and clothing available in-game.
Added full beast races support.
  
* Added missing mipmaps to one texture.
Improved collision on ground/inventory items.
  
* Fixed minor rope clipping on the hats.
Fixed clipping ears on the hats.
  
* Removed Deer Race from the hats.
Fixed wrong 1st person female model.
  
* Fixed missing weigh sliders on the boots records.
Fixed invisible interior of the jewelry.
  
* Amulets now will be concealed.
Added "Warm" keyword for the Survival Mode.
  
* Fully compatible with body mesh replacers, like HIMBO, for example. Just install them after my mod.
ESL plugin that will work with any Skyrim version. It will replace "RiverfolkClothes.esl". It's fine to install/update mid-game, you won't loose any already crafted item.
  

  
**Optional files**

  
* **Optional 2K and 1K optimized textures** (The original are 4K). Requires one of the Main files installed first.
**Non-HDT version**. It also includes a new [Strawless version](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/136348/136348-1734552613-1684409402.jpeg)﻿ available in-game. You can switch to this version (from HDT-SMP) without any problem, but you can't switch back (without a clean install). Fully compatible with the SPID patches.
