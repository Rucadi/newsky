This is just a patch to address some missed circlet replacements (elves) introduced by [USKP/USSEP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266). All credit given to [johnskyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3165110) the [JS Armored Circlets](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2140) author and [animejunkey](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/2251685) who published the [JS Circlet Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8686).
  
  
I was made aware that this exact thing was already available but am leaving this up just incase it is easier to find due to the title, etc. So credit and editing permissions to [obpluto](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/819269)﻿ for beating me to the punch with the same patch under his/her blanket patch page: [Circlet USSEP Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35576)
