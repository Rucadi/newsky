Hello! 
  
 
  
  
 ﻿A few years ago I released the original Simple Wearable Lanterns as a vanilla+ portable light source. This mod is a top-to-bottom remaster of that mod, including completely redone 3d models and textures, adjusted lighting and balancing, bug fixes, and leveled list integration for vendors.

 ﻿Inspired by Dragon's Dogma, Bloodborne and Elden Ring, these lanterns are equipable apparel pieces with custom enchantments that emit light. 
  
 ﻿They can all be crafted at the blacksmith forge using various metals, Junk items, and alchemy ingredients. Or, if its in stock you may purchase it at general goods merchants. No crafting perks required, just materials.
  
 ﻿The Lanterns do not require fuel to function, they are crafted with different alchemy ingredients that "provide" the light source.

 ﻿This mod uses base game functionality to work. There are no requirements. Textures are 4k Diffuse, and 2k Normal.
  
 ﻿﻿This remaster of the original SWL is being uploaded onto this separate mod page, instead of an update to the old page. The original mod has lots of translations, patches and extra features addons mods created by the nexus community, and I didn't want to do anything that could break those mods or make them redundant. The original SWL will be left as is, and will not be receiving any further support.
  
 
  
Everything in this mod was created by me. I used Blender, Substance Painter, Gimp, Outfit Studio and Nifskope to create this mod.
  
 ﻿If there are any problems let me know, user images are greatly appreciated. 
  
  
Like the original mod this is Incompatible with Face Lights, or mods that add lights sources to weapons and spells.
  
In my own custom load order of 1150+ mods, including lighting overhauls like the LUX series, I run into zero issues.
