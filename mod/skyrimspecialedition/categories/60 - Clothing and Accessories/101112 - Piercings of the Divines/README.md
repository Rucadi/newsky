Nipple piercings for each of the Nine Divines. Easily craftable by taking any Divine amulet to a tanning rack and converting them to piercings.
  
  
Piercings have the same enchantments as their amulet counterparts, so you can double up on those Divine Blessings!
  
  
The piercings use whatever texture you have for your vanilla shrine meshes. 
  
(except for Kynereth, I couldn't figure a way to fit her shrine onto a nipple, she uses amulet textures)
  
I recommend using a replacer like [Remiros' Shrines HD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22328).
  
This mod is compatible with mesh replacers for shrines as long as they use completely new texture file paths like [JS Shrines of the Divines SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33394).
