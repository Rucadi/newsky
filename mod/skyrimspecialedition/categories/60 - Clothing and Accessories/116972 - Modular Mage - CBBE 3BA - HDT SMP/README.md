[font=Verdana]**﻿Description**[/font]

A [The Amazing World of Bikini Armors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/83383)﻿ inspired mod centered around styles fit for mages!
  
With over 100 unique items from harnesses, thongs, and corsets, to skirts, coats, and scarves, you can make your mage as sexy or as close to practical as you like!

  
  
[font=Verdana]**How to get**[/font]

Once you join the College of Winterhold you can find the first Novice crafting book in your quarters in the Hall of Attainment. You will unlock the ability to create more crafting manuals at a tanning rack as you level up your faction rank throughout the College of Winterhold quest.
  
(if you're already the Arch-mage you will be able to craft all books right away!)
  
Your colleagues may have higher level books in their possession, but for legal reasons I must state the College frowns upon taking "research" materials that do not belong to you.
  
  
**Patches from other authors**
  
  
[Modular Mage SPID and Enchanted Variants](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/119784)﻿ will let your college mates wear a variety of items. It will also allow trainers to sell enchanted items fit to the respective school they teach.
  
  
[Modular Mage Outfits Distribution - SPID](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/119519) will give items to all mages across Skyrim.﻿
  
  
[Vagrant Robes for Modular Mage](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/165676) adds exactly what it says on the tin.﻿
  
  
  
**Known issues/quirks**May need to do pass on item values and crafting ingredients. I would appreciate feedback on this topic!
  
A few items look a little odd with [xavbio's Robes Retexture](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/110655) due to the baked on AO shadows, not much I can do about it unfortunately.﻿

Some clothes might clip with other clothing or armor mods. Again, not a lot I can do about that. What I can do is if any items within this mod itself clip with each other, please report any extreme examples of this!
  
Tops cannot be worn with panties if you have Schlongs of Skyrim or The New Gentlemen installed. Install the optional KID file.
