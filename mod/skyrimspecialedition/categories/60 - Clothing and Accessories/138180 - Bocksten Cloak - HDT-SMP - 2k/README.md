# Bocksten Cloak - HDT-SMP - 2k

This mod adds a cloak with enabled SMP Physics for the player to wear over their existing outfit.
  
I made this because I thought something cozier than a fur cape would fit the game well.
  
  
The cloak occupies slot 46 so it should be compatible with most accessory mods, barring backpacks and other cloaks of course. The cloak is SMP-enabled, weight slider enabled, and available for both genders. The cloaks have the appropriate keywords for the base game and for Survival Mode, which means mods like Sunhelm will also recognize these items as adding warmth to the player. They can be crafted at the tanning rack using two linen wraps, auxiliary components and dying agents like flowers or fats. The textures come in 2k resolutions. The cloaks have fitting inventory models.
  
  
There are nine color variations. These are:
  
Tattered Brown Cloak
  
Common Red Cloak
  
Common Blue Cloak
  
Common Green Cloak
  
Common Black Cloak
  
Common White Cloak
  
Elaborate Ruby Cloak (luxurious red)
  
Elaborate Sapphire Cloak (luxurious blue)
