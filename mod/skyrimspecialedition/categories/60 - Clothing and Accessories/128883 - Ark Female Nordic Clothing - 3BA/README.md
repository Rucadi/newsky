**Description**
  
  
[font=Tahoma]For a long time I have had a number of mods I made hanging around on my hard drive collecting dust, I have decided to release theses mods as more of a modders resource compared to a proper release so people can enjoy and use them in their own creations. 
  
  
Theses meshes have been created by me, please feel free to uses the meshes in this mod, only credit is needed to be provided on any mods you make.
  
  
Even though this is more of a modders resource that doesn't mean you can't use theses clothes in game, you will need to use an add item menu to access the clothing, in the esp I have also created a number of outfits and used skypatcher to distribute them to a number of Whiterun citizens. I also highly recommend to use [rustic clothing](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4703) with the outfit as that is what I used when creating the mesh.
  
  
That means you need [Skypatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106659) if you want the distribution (or just delete the SKSE folder if you don't)
  
  
You can create your own skypatcher patch and distribute the outfits to other NPC's if you want.

**F.A.Q**
  
  

  
* What does "As is" mean?

﻿ ﻿
  
 *﻿It means that pretty much as soon as this mod is released I more than likely will not provided any patches or fixes for this mod*
  
  

  
* Why not?

  
 ﻿*This was never meant to be a proper mod release, the files have been sitting on my hard drive for months and I didn't want the meshes to go to waste ﻿﻿therefore I have decided to release this as more of a modders resource*
  

  
* Where are Saadia's shoes?

  
 *[i]If skypatcher /SPID files (I tried both) used on a existing save Saadia will have no shoes, I have no idea what is causing that.*[/i]
  
  

  
* This doesn't look very "nordic" to me

  
 *﻿Yeah about that, the original intent was to create more nordic themed clothes out of vanilla meshes but that kind of went out the window and I couldn't ﻿be ﻿asked to change the esp name therefore nordic stuck*
  
  

  
* BodySlide?

  
 *﻿3BA and some BHUNP files are included*
  
  

  
* Male Outfit/meshes?

  
 ﻿Currently none in this mod
