[font=Verdana]Distributes dunmeri armors and outfits from Dragonborn DLC to Skyrim and Dawnguard dark elf NPCs without editing the NPC records. Replaces the outfits of all unique (named) dark elves, except for Gabriella (Dark Brotherhood), Karliah (Thieves Guild) and Savos Aren (College of Winterhold).
  
  
**Will it conflict with my NPC overhaul mods?**
  
No. Spell Perk Item Distributor injects the outfits without editing facegen, headparts and everything else that defines their appearance.
  
  
**Doesn't work for me!**
  
Open console, click on the NPC, type disable and then enable. If this doesn't work, you probably didn't install SPID properly.
  
  
**What the plugin does exactly?**
  
The plugin adds 3 new outfit combinations that doesn't exist in Dragonborn.esm: Brown Dunmeri Outfit without Hood, Cultist Outfit without Mask and Morag Tong armor without Helmet. It's ESL-flagged.
  
  
**I don't like a certain armor/outfit for a NPC. How can I change or disable it?**
  
Open "DunmerOutfits\_DISTR.ini" with a text editor (like Notepad or Word) and delete the NPC's name from the Outfit line. If you want to change the NPC's outfit to another, simply move the NPC's name to the outfit that you want.
  
  
**Can I disable or edit it mid-game?**
  
Yes, it's completely safe to do it mid-game, but you may need to manually disable and enable some NPCs to reset their outfits.
