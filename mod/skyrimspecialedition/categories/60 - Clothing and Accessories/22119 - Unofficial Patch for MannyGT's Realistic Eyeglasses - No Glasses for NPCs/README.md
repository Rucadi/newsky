No Glasses for NPCs**[size=3]Have you used the mod [Realistic Eyeglasses SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11807)﻿but wished you had all the eyeglasses to yourself?
  
Do you want to deprive actors like Belethor and Jarl Balgruuf of enjoying the same eyeglasses you wear?
  
This patch will allow you to wear all of the spectacles for yourself **without sharing them with the Jarls and other unique NPCs!

[size=6]Installation
  
[/size][/size][/font][font=Times New Roman]1. Download this mod with [Mod Organizer 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194)﻿ or your favorite mod manager.
  
  
2. Let it overwrite the .esp for [Realistic Eyeglasses SE.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11807)﻿
  
  
**Important Note: The NPCs will keep their eyeglasses if you already have Realistic Eyeglasses SE installed since they have been distributed to them and they already own them. This patch will only work if you are playing with Realistic Eyeglasses SE installed for the first time.**([size=1]Well, technically you could disable the original .esp, save without it, install this patch and enable it, and it should work, but it's unwise to uninstall mods with plugins mid-playthrough, and no support will be given if you choose to do this.)[/size][/font]

[font=Times New Roman]**Important Notes**[size=3]This is my first attempt at a patch. [MannyGT](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3150929)﻿ was kind enough to give me his [permission](https://imgur.com/a/ys3ars7)﻿ to upload this, so please check out his profile, and give all kudos and endorsements to him, and download his other mods.
  
  
I created this patch for practice using Xedit. I have tested that it works, and I guarantee it is safe to use. Personally, I like the effects of the original mod, but I created this for people who don't. If you encounter any problems when using this patch, please direct all issues to me.
  
  
This .esp is clean and saved in form 44. You should check that all your Special Edition plugins are form 44. You can do so using Xedit, but I recommend using [Wrye Bash](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6837)﻿ since it will give you a list of all plugins that need to be converted.
  
In a perfect world, all SSE plugins would already be form 44, but for multiple reasons some are not. If some of yours are, it's a matter of loading the plugin in Creation Kit and clicking save.
