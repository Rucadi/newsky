This is a pack of random casual. Half of them are knitted theme, I guessed. Winter is not really a theme but it was release on winter of 2023 so I called it that. It was hosted on my Patreon for years and awaiting a merger with other new packs into Cosplay Pack II but Gala and Basics alone are 2GB each and the merged pack of 3-4 packs like that would ended up being a 10GB mod which no one will download. So scratch that plan, I'll upload them individually.
  
  
For those who been using the 2023 release version and haven't keep up with the updates, here is the list of the differences:
  
- adding Sleeveless Turtleneck, Comfy Sweater, Comfy Hoodie (each with 3 tex variation and 2 alt versions
  
- Redo and optimize jewelry and chains
  
- Implement new gemstone method (same one used in Gala)
  
- General texture improvement
  
- Bodyslide refinement and add more custom sliders
  
- General optimization
  
  
Users are highly encouraged to use this pack along side [Cosplay Basics](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/156408) for more accessories.﻿
  
  
Supports only [CBBE 3BA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30174) (v2.4 or above).

THIS IS NOT A PLUG AND PLAY MOD
  
If you are a beginner with very minimal modlist and have no idea what SMP or bodyslides are, LOOK THEM UP first before getting this mod.
  
  
Warning: this mod features some SMP parts.
  
Result may varied on lower end PC.
  
  
﻿
  
  
You can open and use bodyslide while in game and make changes to your clothing model without having to relaunch the game using MO2.
  
  
These are meme cloth, mostly: Dongtan, Ao Dai, Mindress, 5 kinds of turtle necks, Comfy Sweater and Hoodie, Virgin Killer and Destroyer.
  
  
There are also accessories such as necklaces, earrings and bag
  
  
This Pack is not SMP heavy at all most pieces are not designed to have SMP
  
  
Some also come with extra parts and risque version.
  
﻿
  
There are compatibility sliders for Cosplay Basics, particularly the 'Pressed' and 'Pantyhose' sliders

If you are a new user and you have no idea what 3BA or SMP or bodyslides are, look them up first.
  
  
1) Install all the requirements and make sure they are up and running
  
2) Install with your mod manager of choice (MO2 is the correct answer)
  
3) Enable the mod plugin on your load order
  
4) open bodyslide and select group
  
5) outfit is in the group [Caenarvon] Cosplay Pack II
  
6) Batch build with your favorite bodyslide preset and exit
  
6) Select the one - [SMP] suffix if you want to build with SMP
  
8) The costume is ready for your gameplay
  
  
9) Optional - Look up bodyslide individually for further customization
  
  
HOW TO GET
  
  
Use [additem menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17563)﻿ or [SearchUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/155713)﻿ or item spawner you like
  
  
I'll probably make a clothing store mod at some point and put all my cloth there with an NPC to sell it.

Q: *Should I delete older version from Patreon and use this one?*
  
A: Yes, this one is more up to date.
  
  
Q: *I am using your other mods and mod manager is giving a conflict warning when installing this mod, what?*
  
A: Ignore it, its just a few reused cubemaps.
  
  
Q: *SMP stretch down on the ground, broken physics broken mod xdd*.
  
A: You did not install SMP correctly. Follow the instruction on SMP mod page *closely*.
  
  
Q: *I enter new cell and SMP is all messed up.*
  
A: Some cell entrance is so far away from world origin where you actually spawn in and the game has to move you through long distance instantly to the door you are entering the cell from. Getting warp to the entry is what mess SMP up. It is simply a game design thing, not much I can do.
  
  
In fact, if SMP behaves weirdly, reequipping or use SMP reset console is your best bet
  
I highly recommend this mod
  
[Clean Up the Physics Outfit - Collision Reset](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86845)﻿
  
for immersive way to reset SMP
  
  
Q: *Does this mod work on AE?*
  
A: Yes
  
  
Q: *Why it does not look like by character's body type?*
  
A: Build in bodyslide with your preset
  
  
Q: *Costume clip a little bit, help?*
  
A: As much as I tried to, it won't be prefect for all slider combinations. On user's side, you can fix a minor clipping by opening the outfit in Outfit Studio and use inflate tool to repair the clipped area.
  
  
I will not make bodyslide for other body mods
