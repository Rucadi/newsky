This small mod adds several Akaviri (Asian) style hats for you to craft and wear.
  
I originally made these while making Moon Monk's Robes as a bit of a fun little experiment to learn how to model bamboo or straw hats. They were supposed to release with that mod, but I decided to hold off and keep them separate so that mod could release sooner.
  
  
There are three hat meshes made entirely from scratch, with some alternate textures for two of them.[/color][/font][font=Tahoma] Made using Blender, Zbrush, and Substance Painter.

[size=3][font=Georgia]**Some Notes:**[/font]
  
[/size]

  
* Khajiit ears clip through the hats. I tried to fix this, but unfortunately a Creation Kit limitation where khajiit ears take up both the ears and hair slots prevents me from hiding the ears unless I hide hair for all races or make duplicate hats just for khajiit I guess
The plugin is flagged as ESL so it doesn't count toward the plugin limit
  

[font=Georgia][color=#f1c232]**How to Obtain:**[/color][/font]
  

  
* Craft the metal conical hats at any forge
Craft the straw and folded hats at any tanning rack
