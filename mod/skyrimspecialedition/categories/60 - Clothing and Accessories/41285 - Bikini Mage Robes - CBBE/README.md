[left]We've all seen it before: a player  prepares their mods, loads up their skimpy armors, and starts a new game of Skyrim, only to realize "Wait a minute, I wanted to play as a mage this time...but I only have heavy armor bikinis!"
  
  
And so they have no choice but to throw away their Samsung Smart Fridge and never play Skyrim again.
  
  
Thankfully, this tragedy is a thing of the past, with the new[/left]

**What is it?**
  
This mod provides BodySlide files for two new massively-customizable mage robes. Downloads include packages for CBBE/CBBE Physics, as well as 3BBB Amazing Body. Install either, or both at once.
  
  
When you build the outfits in BodySlide, you'll have the option of choosing the Replacer sets, which will act as replacers for the College of Winterhold Apprentice robes and Journeyman robes, or the Standalone sets, which (through the use of an additional ESP) introduce standalone versions of the bikini robes, allowing you to leave your vanilla robes untouched. Or use both Replacer and Standalone in the same game for maximum robe variety.
  
  
Pieces include Apprentice robes, hood (for all races), and boots; and the Journeyman robes and boots. 1st Person models (ie. bare arms) are included in the sets too.
  
  
Extensive BodySlide Zap customization options mean you can make the robes look the way you like. Skimpy or non-skimpy, cool or sexy (or both). Just look at those screenshots, man. Look how diagonal they are. That's how you *know* it's good stuff.
  
  
  
**How does it work?**
  
Download and install. The installation package offers the option of installing an optional Standalone ESP if you like (it's ESL flagged, don't worry).
  
  
Next, open [BodySlide](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/201) and build the outfits using your favorite BodySlide preset. The new robes will be collected in the groups "Bikini Robe Replacer" or "Bikini Robe Standalone". Pieces will have the prefix "Bikini Robe". If you're using the Standalone ESP, be sure you build the Standalone outfits too, or you're gonna have a bad time.
  
  
A good tip is to batch-build the set you like, then go back and choose customization options and build individual pieces a second time (that way, you won't be missing one by accident).
  
  
The outfits that are built don't come with their own textures, but instead will use whatever mage robe textures you have installed. For best results, you should probably use the [Opulent Outfits Vanilla Texture Replacer SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41079), though you can still technically use whatever robe textures you like, it won't break anything (but it may look a bit janky).
  
  
\*The Standalone sets are always included with the BodySlide files, but only the ESP will enable them in-game. Just remember to build them.
  
  
Acquiring the Standalone robe versions will require the use of console commands (use help "bikini robe" to find the pieces) or simply use [AddItemMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17563)﻿. (It may seem like a hassle to do it this way, but the less the ESP impacts your game, the less there's a chance for conflicts.)
  
  
Using mod versions 2.0.0+, outfit zaps can be safely uh, saved, when using the "Save" or "Save As" buttons. This will store the zaps in your body shape preset, so remember to use "Save As" to create a new one if you don't want any alterations to your base preset.
  
  
  
**Conflicts/Compatibility**
  
-Technically compatible with all robe retextures (though best with [Opulent Outfits Vanilla Texture Replacer SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41079), of course).
  
-When you build the outfits, they will overwrite any previous mage robes you may have installed or BodySlide-built.
  
-If you have any mods that disable vanilla robes, the replacer outfits will obviously not be seen in-game. However, the standalone outfits should still be fine.
  
-The standalone outfits are simple, unenchanted robe items based on the latest stats from the Unofficial Patch, so if you're using some other mod that changes the stats of equipment, be warned that the Standalone bikini robes may not match up to the rest of your game.
  
-The optional files section contains a compatibility patch for outfit replacers (like [BD's Armor and Clothing Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32518)﻿). The patch merely contains the USSEP armor addon records for the college robes. Loading the patch after the outfit replacer should undo its changes and let the robes from this mod show up in your game. However, the patch may not work for mods that replace both the armor addon *and* armor records for a given robe (ie. mods that include not only appearance changes, but also stat or functionality changes as well).
  
  
  
**Other notes and features**
  
- The Bikini Robes are designed to synergize very well with the [Bikini Armor Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40015)﻿. In fact, this mod comes with updated BodySlide group files that will include the new Bikini Replacer robes with the rest, allowing you to batch build all Bikini Replacer items at once, if you like.
  
- It's also possible to use Bikini Armor Replacer 1-handed gauntlets with these robes.
  
- Among the many Zap customization options are "Sleeve" and "Stocking" pieces. Some of these are labeled with (G) or (B). These pieces are partitioned in such a way that they will automatically disappear when you equip Gauntlets or Boots.
  
- When using the [Opulent Outfits Vanilla Texture Replacer SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41079), for best results, select a single color for all Apprentice variants, and a single color for all Journeyman variants.

**Common Problems and Solutions**
  
Problem: In BodySlide, it looks like there are chunks missing from the body
  
~~Likely Cause: You've saved your body shape preset while zaps have been active. Saving your body preset for an outfit that includes zaps puts the zaps directly into the preset file, but without any reference to that specific outfit, leaving them active for *every* outfit. This can cause the zaps to be activated improperly.
  
Solution: Reload a clean version of your preset or manually edit the body preset XML file to remove zaps.~~
  
Solution: Using mod version 2.0.0, this problem should no longer occur. Outfit presets can now be saved without causing errors.
  
  
Problem: When I equip an item in-game, my entire body disappears, leaving no clothes at all. My character is just a floating head.
  
Likely Cause: The mesh file for the clothing piece you're trying to equip doesn't exist.
  
Solution: Build the outfit in BodySlide. If you're using the Standalone ESP, be sure to build the Standalone clothing pieces (they're in their own clearly labeled group, and if you just batch build the "Bikini Robe Replacer" group, they won't be created). Check the folders data->meshes->clothes-> mageapprentice, magejourneyman, and magerobebikini (if you're using Standalone). Be sure these folders have nif files in them. If you have Nifskope, open the nifs and take a look to be sure they look okay.
  
If you do that and still have problems, then you should ask about it in the forum I guess.
  
  
Problem: My hood is floating in place and not moving with my character
  
Likely Cause: A flaw in the BodySlide ShapeData nif reacting poorly with HDT-SMP
  
Solution: Download mod version 1.0.1+, which includes a fix for this issue
  
  
Problem: I uninstalled the mod, but some parts are still there.
  
Likely Cause: When BodySlide builds armors from these files, those nifs are no longer associated with this mod, meaning that uninstalling it will still leave the robe sets in the clothing folders.
  
Solution: Just delete everything in your meshes->clothing->mageapprentice and magejourneyman folders upon uninstalling. The game will automatically revert to vanilla meshes. Or alternatively, just build a different replacer (like the CBBE Vanilla set that comes standard with CBBE). But note this may yet lead to...
  
  
Problem: My mage hood has a purple field covering the face.
  
Likely Cause: Missing face shadow texture, possibly due to uninstalling the mod without deleting the existing hood mesh from the clothing folder, or from a faulty installation.
  
Solution: If you've uninstalled the mod, just delete the hood mesh from meshes->clothing->mageapprentice. For whatever reason, the hood part is not included in the CBBE Vanilla replacer set, and so it has a tendency to stick around if not dealt with manually. If the texture was missing since the beginning, it's likely a problem with your install. Check the textures folder for textures->clothes->magerobebikini, and the texture Hood\_Shade\_Gradient.dds to be sure it was installed correctly. If it's there, but you're still seeing problems, it's likely a more complex issue of some kind.
  
  
  
  
**Potentially asked questions**
  
Q: Are you gonna port this to LE?
  
A: Nuh uh. I'm ready to move on to the next one. But *you* can port it, if you like.
  
Update: A port to LE has been completed by one NIND. Check it out at [this link](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/106469?tab=description).
  
  
Q: Some of these things aren't bikinis.
  
A: That's not a question, hypothetical person. By now, I think everyone understands the paradigm of "Bikini Armor" and what it entails.
  
  
Q: Will there be a BHUNP version?
  
A: You know, I actually started one, but uuuUuUUUUuuuuuggggh! Do you know how many sliders BHUNP has? Like, almost 200, man. That's no joke. So, in conclusion, no. But as always, *you* can do it if you want.
  
  
Q: How come these robes make my butt look big?
  
A: That's to help reduce clipping with leg armor.
  
  
Q: What about HDT-SMP?
  
A: I looked into that too. Unfortunately, without the proper toolchain already in place, I just can't make it work, and I wanted to get this mod out sometime this millennium. But whenever someone does make an HDT-SMP+cloth version, I'll be at the front of the line to download it. And I sure hope that person starts soon, because I have a mighty need for cloth physics.
