Description
  
This mod adds a bunch of craftable and enchantable piercings meant for use with the BHUNP and 3BA bodies! Each comes in a finely handcrafted box to keep your precious jewelry safe, and to reduce the wear when it is not being worn. The mod includes a variety of piercings, varying from more basic ones to some shark/ocean inspired exotic ones. Important to note also, that all the piercings are meant to be built in bodyslide before they appear in-game.
  
  
 The following exotic nipple piercings are included with the mod: Barbell Anchor Piercings, Ring Anchor Piercings, Shark Bullet Piercings, and Fishing Hook Piercings. As for more basic nipple piercings, these are offered: Long and Short Barbells, Curved Barbells, Basic Rings, Sphered Rings, Fancy Shield Piercings (Gem's optional), and Ring-Shield Piercings. For belly piercings there are 3 options, a Fishing Hook Piercing and Long/Short Belly Barbells.
  
  
Other things this mod adds - A finely crafted necklace, the Vortex Medallion (Needs to be bodyslided as well, and can be crafted ingame) - Lip and Fin piercings for the Selachii custom race (requires the Selachii file for this) - And a handful of enchanted piercings hidden around the game world. 
  
  
Requirements

[XPMSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1988) - You will need this as the piercings are setup for using body physics, even if not using the physics you would crash without this.

[3BA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30174) - For those wishing to use the 3BA files.
  
[Selachii Shark Race](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/17072-the-selachii-shark-race-se-wip/) (For Selachii File) - You will need this file if you want to use the Selachii's facial piercings added by this mod.

Bodyslide Info
  
**In order to have the piercings show up in-game you will need to build them with bodyslide, and should also build the body to fit with them.**To speed up the process of building the outfits I recommend using the Outfit Group feature and filter to Sharkish Piercings. This will allow you to batch build the whole mod in one go!
