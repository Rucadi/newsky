**B**east **H**air **H**orn **B**eards and **B**rows
  
  
A mod only for Argonians and Khajiits (Beast races)

[left]**Files and contents**[/left]

  
* A complete visual overhaul for the beast race npcs featuring new and unique vanilla based assets

  

  
* New Player character creation options - hairs, brows, beards.  p.e. in racemenu Khajiit now have a brow slider. And Argonians have extended options in the brow slider to complement the hair sliders. You can spend hours making a character.

  

  
* Addons for mods that add Beast Race npcs - visual replacers

  

  
* iBeasts - a complete visual replacer for the mod Interesting Npcs - also a character creation extension for BeastHHBB and Beards fo Power for Khajiits - features many new options with npcs that use.  Features external assets such as high poly heads and many others. Added a display of the replaced npcs in the image section, they are in the last rows.

  
* Feminine female Khajiits - optional files for the npc replacers - adds new unique head meshes for female Khajiits. Files available for the main file and iBeasts, which overwrites them.

  

  
* Adoptable Beast Children - No blank space left in the cold heart of Skyrim. Before there was none. Standalone mod, no requirements.

Spoiler
  
  
Make your own table with six beastly children - 3 Khajiits and 3 Argonians
  
This mod is not a replacer.
  
No requirements but it was made to be used with [Hearthfire´s multiple adoptions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3862/) mod, this way you can get them all instead of the default 2. 
  
For this recommended mod to work you need to start a new game for it to take effect, otherwise the game will still register 2 maximum adoptions. Unless you already had it installed.
  
  
This would not happen without other mods assets.
  
  
Same as vanilla adoption quest, find them and adopt them.
  
  
They will not talk to you, like the other adoptable children, unless you complete the quest Innocence Lost and have bought a player home.
  
A new game is recommended, especially if you visited the ratway, where Fell-in-his-sap is. You´d need to console command him to you. No support fot this.
  
  
  
BeastHHBB, but with no beards, introducing:
  

  
* Fell-in-his Sap - Argonian male - is different and in trouble because of it - Riften ratway
Waits-for-Fredas - Argonian male - a creative rugrat and a scavenger -  Markarth Warrens
  
* Willisi - Argonian female - well versed and educated, favored by hagravens - Witchmist Grove
Kai-Lin - Khajiit female -  tigress in a wooden home - Riften orphanage
  
* Stripe - Khajiit male - a scoundrel cat with glowing eyes - Redwater den
Sonaan Paw - Khajiit female - a bard in the making - Bards College

As you can see from the locations they might be in for a bit of trouble.
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
A patch for Lux to download
  
Nothing else is needed to patch unless the same cell layout is changed. It is unlikely even then.
  
This mod has no scripts.
  
  
**Technical**
  
High poly heads argonians and Khajiit are Ko resource heads, also high polys.
  
Custom everything.
  
Did not esl flagged because it re-arranges record configurations and I don't have the time to untangle it.
  
  
**Limitations**
  
[spoiler]
  
Dialogue response at the beginning "I´ll say goodbye to everyone" even though I placed them in a cave or the sort, because.. maybe, they made friends with the nearby fauna.
  
The child voices are default u-mans childs.
  
If they spawn in underwear while using the mod armor and clothing replacer -  switch the children option to off.
  
There are tiny and I mean tiny color mismatch between outfit and head-limbs, nothing to fix this. You won´t notice and even if you do its just petty, they are so small to begin with. 
  
  
Custom clothing and custom sleep clothing. And they all put on their preferred hats to sleep.
  
For npcs to switch between these outfits for sleeping you need this mod [Go to Bed](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4224/) by andrelo1. Which is recommended.
  
Alternatively, if you don´t like the default outfits, you can always switch and change them using sseedit. I do not know about outfits reversing and such.
  
  
[/spoiler]
  
  

  
* Beast Vampire Fangs Fixes and Adjustments - a standalone mod, no requirements, highly compatible changes to the beast races vampire fangs

Spoiler
  
I was sad most users opt for a complete removal of them, so I made them bearable. No esp.Imgs in the last row of the image section.                                  Racemenu sliders change their size, namely the mouth height, smaller - between -1 and 0 recommended. Fixes for the beast vampire fangs 
  

  
* corrects the fangs position for Argonians: no fangs curved sideways, and given different proportions and position because they have 4 fangs
Fixed female argonian fangs-mouth obvious clippings
  
* Fixes the fangs for female Khajiit - the angle was off and almost completely out of the mouth
Half the lenght for female Khajiit and the distance between the fangs is adjusted
  
* at least half the lenght for male Khajiits
Argonians got a dentist appointment
  

  
  
  
[line]
  
**Compatible** with any body/head mesh/textures mods. Personally, I do not use a feather texture replacer for Argonians. Though iBeasts features this in some.
  
  

The main file requires the [Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266/) . There is a link to a pre-ae version of it in the requirements

[line]

31/08/24 - Mod page under construction
  
moved iBeasts to this page for a few reasons: for its insuccess, lack of visibility, and another to bundle everything for beast npcs into a single page.
  
moved Beast Vampire fangs fixes and adjustments to this page for the same reasons.
  
moved Adoptable Beast Children to this page for the same reasons.
  
  
I do not do fancy mod pages, no time and no skill for that.
  
  
  
The SMP hair physics replacer versions will come in due time after I finish other stuff.

**H**ave fun!

[line]About the replacer
  
excluded hooded Khajiits, p.e. M´aiq - a visual trait reference - Hircine Hunters, one-timers, dead npcs, visions and ghosts.
  
Argonian npcs in Riften are lush, in Solitude, crooks, in Windhelm, weirds.
  
Beast followers - changes to spells, perks, levels, stats to the beast followers (3) - basically uncapping the level without turning them op.b
  
  
  
[line]
  
  
minor unimportant things to help troubleshoot Spoiler
  
1) Do not change hair in console commands, especially as a vampire. The hairs reset with saves and the face sculptor does not work properly with vampires 
  
2)The owl brow will be invisible from behind. Does not affect any other option. Unoticeable.
  
3)With the increase of the brow section options for Argonians, the sliders for mouth and nose give additionally 40 empty options. The first ones on the slider are the ones that matter
  
  
Two of the Khajiit beards don´t show up (?) 34i has double earrings; minor clipp on a hairstyle with some rugs; 31d with very slight horn clipping (viewed from above). very few options with horns have a brown base colour for the horns, meant for females, vice-versa. 
  
Incompatible with:mods that add new hairs for the beast races with names such as, p.e. hairkhajiitfemale10 and so forth, because those names are in use here. 
  
If by some reason you have Argonian feathers that are not vanilla and can´t remember where they come from and want to delete them (this mod does not have any) delete these 3 files from data folder to restore them to vanilla:  argonianhair\_n.dds,  argonianhair.dds and argonianfemalehair.dds 
  
  
Eyeballs Spoiler 
  
The eye deviating from its centered orbit is a vanilla issue. It happens with all races but it is most common and noticeable on Argonians.Things that affect this:
  
[\*]spamming pushing to talk to the npc causes them to get stuck
  
[\*]games with stuttering present.
  
  
Argonians (et all) that have had the eye width and depth altered in racemenu suffer from this more often, again, if the game stutters and with exported heads.
  
This can be "interrupted" by pushing to talk, or leaving the present cell and allow them to re-load. This happens between expression transitions and they get stuck between them. In my game I rarely have this with high fps and mods. Again it happens potentially with all races. I use the expressive mod. Steps have been made for the most conversational npcs here to be on par with vanilla in case of complaints. In short, its too much eye edits (vanilla or not) +lots of mods and struggling fps. 
  
Other than that chunky desynced argonian expression articulation is nothing new, the eyes just go mad trying to match it.
