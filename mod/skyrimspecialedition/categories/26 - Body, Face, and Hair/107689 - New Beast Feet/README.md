Adds new feet meshes for Argonians and Khajiit (plantigrade). Also includes remodeled meshes of some vanilla footwear, so they stay consistent.
  
  
Works with any body texture mod, no patching necessary! Includes BodySlide files and prebuilt meshes for [CBBE 3BA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30174) and [HIMBO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46311) (but they should work with any other body mod too)!
  
  
[size=4]Comes with ESL flagged ".esp", with forwarded changes from [USSEP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266). Prebuilt meshes are 0-ed.[/size]
  
  
Meshes are based on [Feet For Beast Races](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/16976) and [Argonian Reptilian Feet](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29479). Big thanks to [Grimoa](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/572876) and [Derok](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/1750291).
