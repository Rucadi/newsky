This mod adds a lion-like hairstyle for male khajiit. It can be worn either as a one-piece hairstyle or as a hair+beard combo.
  
  
Optionally, the hair comes with physics through HDT-SMP. This is a light-weight physics system for a gentle rustling effect, with minimal performance impact. The SMP version also includes an equippable version of the hair.
  
  
Install or uninstall at any time. The ESP can be flagged as light if you are short on plugin spots.
