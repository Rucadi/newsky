This brings the fluffy tail from my Snow Leopard mod for Oblivion to Skyrim. This is set up to add the tails to all Khajiit in the game, including the player.
  
  
Detail:
  

  
* Replaces the maletailkhajiit.nif and femaletailkhajiit.nif with new versions
Creates a new texture set to use with the new .nif models.
  
* There are a few non-standard things done with this, like combining model-space and tangent space normal maps. Report problems, I suppose
The darkened area near the base is a compromise with lighting. It seems that, since it is "facing up," lights reflect from it in odd ways
  
from the rest of the body and tail. The dark color reduces the effect while not giving it a clearly different sheen.
  
Fluffy tails will appear on any Khajiit that uses vanilla assets, including companions like Inigo.
  
  
1.1: Reworked textures to give a less uniform look, plus added white tail tips.
