# Hide Those Ears for Goam's Elven Ears (or Human Beards)

**Ear Today, Gone Tomorrow...**
  
  
A simple invisible 'ear wrap' that magically hides your comically huge, gracefully pointy, incredibly sticking out-ish, elf or kitty or whatever ears. Designed to use with [Goam's Elven Ears](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99528).
  
  
Now whenever you don a solid metal helmet, thick fur hood, or densely woven robe, you can carefully wrap your ears up or bind them down so that they won't get awkwardly bent and crushed by your headwear. You'll also save so much money on replacing ripped hoods!
  
  
Why do you need this? Goam's Elven Ears uses slot 44 (face/mouth) rather than the normal ear slot, so all normal headgear won't hide it by default. 
  
  
  
**How to get:**
  
Create the Invisible Head Wrap at the tanning rack with a leather strip.
  
  
  
**Requirements:**Requires a mod like [Beard Mask Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80232) to hide 'facial hair' (or ears) when using Slot 44. 
  
  
Doesn't *require*Goam's Elven Ears, but unless you are using another mod that also adds something to that slot, this won't mod do much except give you an invisible piece of cloth to wear on your face. It should also hide vanilla beards, actually, they use Slot 44 as well, if you want to toggle a clean shaven look on and off.
  
  
  
  
**Compatibility:**
  
  
ESP flagged esl. 
  
  
[Goam's Elven Ears - Proper RaceMenu Integration](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/122236) is NOT compatible because it modifies the slot used by the ears to one that isn't usable by armour/clothing. This means that it can't be hidden/swapped out by anything your character wears, which unfortunately includes this mod.
  
  
Shouldn't conflict with anything else (unless you want to wear a different item in slot 44, but that isn't a conflict, just a fashion choice), load anywhere.
  
  
  
**Display Options**I created a [Hide Your Ears preset for Skyrim Outfit System Revived](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/101825?tab=description) which will automatically apply the invisible ear wrap for helmets and hoods, and remove it again for bareheaded outfits, so you don't have to juggle the actual item in your inventory (you still need it installed in the game itself). The preset comes with several premade outfits and autoswitch rules to make it easier to plug and play.
