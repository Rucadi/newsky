**Q:**My game freezes when I want to edit my character, why does this happen?
  
**A:**Wait for a bit, the game needs a moment to process all hairstyles. Please also try [SSE Engine Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17230).
  
  
**Q:**How do I change my character's hair?
  
**A: O**pen the console and type in "showracemenu", then close the console (remember to not change your race, or else your skills and perks will be reset!).
  
 Alternatively, you can go to the Ragged Flagon and speak to the Face Sculptor (requires Dawnguard DLC)
  
 
  
**Q:**I found something wrong with a hairstyle. Will you fix it?
  
**A:**Post the issue in the comments and we will see what we can do. 
  
  
**Q:**Does this work with other hair packs?
  
**A:**Yes.
  
  
**Q:**Will you make this available for XBOX1 on Bethesda.net?
  
**A:**https://bethesda.net/de/mods/skyrim/mod-detail/3749288
  
  
**Q:**Do the NPCs of Skyrim use the hairdos from this mod or is it player only?
  
**A:**Player only.
  
  
  
**Please leave any other questions in the comments section if it hasn't already been
  
answered in the F.A.Q. or description!**

Some hairstyles might clip with bodies that have bigger breasts. This is something that can't be fixed unless you do it yourself. 
  
The hairs can't fit perfectly to every body.
  
Hairs may have other problems if you have the old version of the pack. Delete the old files first.
