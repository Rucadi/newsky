[size=5][size=6]**Overview**
  
  
This tattoo pack was originally made for personal use only, but later, I expanded it with bunch of new tattoos, that were either requested by other people or I got another
  
idea in mind.
  
  
All tattoos were made either by hand, using Photoshop or taken from free to use images.
  
  
Some tattoos are original and others are mostly tattoos people were missing
  
and desired ex. Katarina and Akali tattoos from League of Legends.

**Requirements**
  
  
  
You're gonna need only one mod and thats  [Racemenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19080) by [expired](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/2950481), if you don't know how to use it, please read his mod page.
  
  
  
**Before requesting tattoos, please read**
  
  
~~1) If you're requesting image that you want to be made into tattoo, it needs to be free to use.
  
  
2) I need to like the tattoo you're requesting, yes as if it wasn't obvious, I will not accept any random image you request, but it's not like I have some kind of special taste, so you should be fine.
  
  
3) If it isn't image you're sending to me as a request, it means I will have to draw it from scratch, which lowers your chance of your tattoo being accepted.~~~~4) Please send your request to our **[Discord](https://discord.com/invite/HE7RNsDU7p)**, simply join and tag me in ***#modding discussion*** and I will answer as soon as I can.~~
  
  
**Not taking any more requests for this pack, Thank you everyone for your suggestions and support!**
