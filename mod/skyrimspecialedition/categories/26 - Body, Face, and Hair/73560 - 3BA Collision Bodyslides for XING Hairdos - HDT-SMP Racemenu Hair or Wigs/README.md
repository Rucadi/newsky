﻿﻿That's about it just updated 3BA sliders for [HDT-SMP Racemenu Hair or Wigs - by XING](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43120)﻿﻿﻿
  
﻿Original mod has outdated 3BA bodyslides and can result in the hairs clipping on your character
  
These sliders are setup to support current 3BA and prevent or at least help said clipping :)
  
  
Just bodyslides updated with current sliders for the collision meshes
