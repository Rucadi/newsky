…….A little while ago I decided I wanted to try my hand atmaking some cartoon-like characters, as far as their proportions go. When the
  
idea hit, I wanted to also create a new Bodyslide preset, inspired by the works
  
of my Lifelong Favorite comic artist, old-school cartoonist, Bill Ward. From my
  
days in elementary school, reading Cracked magazine, to later in life seeing
  
his work in more ‘adult’ publications, I’ve always loved the exaggerated look
  
of vapid ‘light-headedness’ his female characters had, as well as the bumbling
  
lechery of his males, and if you are familiar with his work, then you can
  
probably understand my choice for the name of this preset. It is not a
  
realistic body, yet it is not dysmorphic by any means. I have modeled the
  
proportions from viewing his drawings, so it is a body w/ fairly skinny legs
  
and butt, with a fairly ridiculous chest. I used Titkit by Monsto, as well as
  
Puffy Nipple Sliders by Vyveryn to achieve the complete look of the breasts. In
  
addition, I used More Sliders for Feet by Balveric in order to also model the
  
characters’ feet after what I think a Bill Ward drawing would look like w/o
  
shoes, but again, within reason. I hadn’t even considered sharing this
  
originally, I was just messing around with Bodyslide one night, as usual. After
  
playing around with it, I figured some of you may appreciate it, so I uploaded
  
it to share. I tried to do Bill Ward’s artistic vision some justice while
  
making a ‘feasible’ game character; To me his ancient, honest works of
  
appreciation are like the modern, pretentious SJW’s Worst Nightmare ?
  
 
  
(p.s.)…..the characters in my screenshots have their proportions changed to 97-98 in height, with a 1.02 or 1.03 size head. If you
  
build your character to default proportions, your results will obviously be
  
different. That’s just an fyi for anyone interested.
