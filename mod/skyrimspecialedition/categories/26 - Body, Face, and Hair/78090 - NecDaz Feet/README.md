**﻿NecDaz Feet** is a replacer that aims to rectify the criminally outdated feet included with CBBE 3BA, by replacing it with a new, more appealing model. Gone are the ping-pong paddle-shaped soles, chunky toes, and low arches. Gone are the unattractive angles, proportions, and shapes. The year is 2022, and what was satisfactory with the game's launch a decade ago simply will not cut it anymore. 
  
  
A special, optional texture is also included, which seeks to improve the textures of the feet & soles, adding in wrinkles, veins, etc. It is based on most recent version of Demoniac's skin.
