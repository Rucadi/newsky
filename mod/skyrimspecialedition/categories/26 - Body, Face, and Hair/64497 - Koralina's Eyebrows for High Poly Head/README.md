**﻿First of all:**
  
  
**You can use this mod however you want.** If you use my assets you can sell your mods, have them on Patreon and earn Donation Points.
  
**You don't have to ask me for permission.** Just don't upload a copy of this mod, let's be respectful.
  
**But ALWAYS credit me.** This is a simple, one condition. If I see any of my mods used without credit **again**, I report for breaking the permissions.
  
  
  
**Now, to the details: 
  
  
The eyebrows are all hand-painted.** I haven't used any resources that are not my own when creating the textures. There are two versions, HQ is 2048x1024 and the normal one is 1024x512. Textures were painted in higher resolution, so this version is recommended.  
  
**This mod is made to work only with High Poly Head.** The textures are high quality so using them with vanilla meshes makes not much sense.
  
**Every eyebrow texture has its own normal map** which makes it look more 3D and not so flat (it's just light-bump work, not 3D object).
  
I recommend tweaking eyebrows placement in RaceMenu, you know - angle, slope, thickness, and this kind of stuff. 
  
You may not like all the variants and it's OK. I made them to create my own characters (and published because I'm a poor student lol, nvm).
  
  
  
**Installation:**
  
  
Manually or with your mod manager.
  
  
  
**Compatibility:**
  
  
It's not a replacer, you can use this with everything.

I can't force you but if you use any of my mods, let others earn Donation Points if they use your assets. You lose literally nothing and it's always rewarding. Don't be a dück.
  
  
Also, if you want any help when creating your own mods, I'm here to help. I'm not a professional but this community is not as active as some years ago and it may be hard to find anyone who writes back. I don't have much time at the end of the semester but I do what I can.
