It's a slider mod that allows you to apply more scars on your character.
  
Supports Vanilla, [High Poly Head,](https://vectorplexus.com/files/file/283-high-poly-head/) [COtR](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27405).
  
ESL-flagged ESP.
  
  
**Requirement**
  
SKSE
  
Racemenu (at least 0.415) 
  
Old version of Racemenu will cause ctd on your saves!
  
  
**Q. Where can i find these sliders?**
  
A. Racemenu -> Head -> More Scars A, B  (HP sliders are for High Poly head)
  
  
**Q. Can't you just use Racemenu Overlay?**
  
A. Racemenu overlay cannot use normal maps, which means it can't add details and depth to scars.
  
**Q. Why did i get bunch of errors on SSEdit when i checked errors?**
  
A. Don't worry. Since we can't make a new head parts type, additional scars must be assigned to unknown type.
  
I made it 53-54, but you can change it.   
  
I've already tested it in game, no errors or ctds happened. It's the same method of [Horns Aplenty](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41022).
  
  
Northborn Scars version added, requires [Northborn Scars](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/720).
