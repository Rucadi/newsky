These are vanilla hair meshes for human races with higher poly count (hence smooth hair), UV tweaks, some tweaks to bone weights and detailed 3d braids.
  
I'm novice at these things, so the meshes aren't perfect, but I've done it as well as I could.
  
  
This mod was inspired by kebrus' Better Vanilla Hair. You can find his mod [here](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/28491/)﻿.
  
  
I have taken a few liberties with a few hairstyles' design, so if you don't like those, there's nothing I can do.
  
  
Only human races for now, but if possible, I might do other races as well.
  
  
Do let me know if you come across any issues. I hope you like it. :)
