A pack with the pre-built assets for NPC mods, to avoid duplicates, a quick and smoother download.
  
  
==============
  
**Safe to update at any point**
  
  
==============
  
  
These assets will be shared between [AllieWadeMods](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/AllieWadeMods) (AW) and [Lexa0100](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/32780095) (MW) accounts to use as a base for our NPC mods to save some space and some time, since it's a pain to create all the head parts each time for only 1 character and to avoid downloading the same head mesh 200 times for different NPCs.
  
  
We built the .esp file from scratch and included some of the needed assets in the loose files.
  
**This is not by any means intended as a replacer for the original mods from where the assets are from**.
  
All credits for said assets go to:
  
- KouLeifoh for [High Poly Head](https://vectorplexis.com/files/file/283-high-poly-head/) 
  
- Kalilies for [KS hairdos](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6817)
  
  
**ESP flagged as light.
  
Compatible with any version of Skyrim SE/AE**
  
The plug-in will be updated if we need to add some other assets or body parts, but we grant you that nothing will be removed to assure maximum compatibility with all the mods depending on this one.
  
  
All our mods will always be free and freely available for download.
  
BUT from now on, we won't allow any of our work to be ported or reuploaded to the Bethesda Marketplace and we don't offer support for Skyrim versions after 1.6.640 (the mod should still work with the new updates).
