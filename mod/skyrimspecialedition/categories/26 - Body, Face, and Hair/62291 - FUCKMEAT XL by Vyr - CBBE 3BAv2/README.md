Guess who! 
  
  
FUCKMEAT will now be a 3 part body series: FUCKMEAT, FUCKMEAT XL, and FUCKMEAT XS.
  
i will make an all-in-one preset if there Is interest :) i know people like diversity.
  
  
FUCKMEAT features those wide, grab-able, pixar mom hips we all love. I'm a hip and thigh kind of lady. clearly.
  
  
FUCKMEAT XL starts at 0 weight as a touched up 100 weight from my original FUCKMEAT. There will be slight clipping with some poses at 100 weight.
  
  
FUCKMEAT is meant to be used around the 50-ish range, and that is where i use it myself. i tried to make both 0 and 100 still as appealing as possible while making 40-50 perfect for my liking.
