**NOW FOR WOMEN!!**

  
This type of mod has been something I have searched for NUMEROUS times and I had yet to find one that didn't have serious clipping issues. I WAS able to find [Howitzer's Hair for Men SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14567?tab=posts) but there was only one option in terms of length and I didn't want the orcs to be better than me. So... After endless tutorials and sleepless nights of screaming at my computer (which it just sits there as I try to talk to it... I think it's ignoring me) I created this mod on my own. This is my first mod so please let me know if you run into any issues. Screenshots encouraged.
  
  
  
  
**WHAT THIS MOD DOES**
  
 ﻿- Adds new hair options for all HUMANS
  
 ﻿ ﻿- Hairstyles come in 4 flavors:
  
 ﻿ ﻿﻿- Short
  
 ﻿ ﻿﻿- Medium
  
 ﻿ ﻿﻿- Long
  
 ﻿ ﻿ ﻿- Viking Long **NEW! in version 2.0**
  
 ﻿- Makes "Vikings" fans happy (the tv show, not the sports team... Well, I mean it COULD make the sports fans happy... Go with whatcha feel on this one)
  
  
  
  
**WHAT THIS MOD DOES NOT DO**
  
 - Change the hair textures (use [Superior Lore-Friendly Hair - HD textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36510)﻿) <-- This is an LE mod but it's only textures so it will work with SSE
  
 ﻿- Add new hair options for all ELVEN races
  
 ﻿﻿~~- Add new hair options for all human FEMALES (currently working on it)~~**DONE!! included in version 2.0**
  
 ﻿- Cure world hunger (not currently working on it)
  
  
  
  
  
**INSTALLATION**
  
  
 ﻿﻿- **Use your favorite mod manager**[font=Arial](you should be doing this. Just do it. Grab a mod manager, buy it a drink, see how you like each other, and then invite it ﻿back ﻿to your place to FILL IT TO THE BRIM WITH MODS UNTIL IT BREAKS)
  
[/font]
  
 ﻿- **Not using a mod manager?** (Didn't I just say... \*sigh\*)
  
 ﻿ ﻿- Unpack the .rar file
  
 ﻿ ﻿- Place the contents into your Skyrim Special Edition "Data" folder.
  
 ﻿ ﻿- [Mod Organizer 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194)﻿

 ﻿ ﻿- [Beginner's Guide to Modding](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/wiki/begin2)﻿ (read ALL OF IT, ya savage)
  
  
  
  
**UNINSTALLATION** (Why are you doing this to me? Is... is it something I said?)
  
  
 ﻿- **Mod manager?**
  
 ﻿ ﻿- Untick the mod from your load order (see how EASY that was)
  
  
 ﻿- **No mod manager?**
  
 ﻿ ﻿- Find and delete all of the files you just threw into your SSE "Data" folder like last week's lasagna (... You did this)
