**What is it?**
  
  
[font=Arial]This mod adds 100+ SMP physics and collision enabled wigs and as of March, 2021 all 100+ are available as Racemenu hairs as well. This version is for the ladies only. For the unisex version for males and females, go [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56583).
  
  
This is a modified version of the SMP wigs conversions that Xing did of the Dint999, Fuse00 and HHaleyys oldrim hair physics hair collections. Originally you had to equip a "collision ring", occupying slot 58. The wig side of this mod does not require the ring to be equipped to activate collisions. Making it a little easier to use and freeing up that equipment slot. Additionally many other fixes and tweaks have been made as described below. 
  
  
As per the original mod, all wigs are craftable (books in Bannered Mare) or you can use the [Add Item Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17563)﻿. All have bracketed names (thanks to my edits), so they won't be spread all over your inventory and menus.
  
  
[/font]Wigs occupy slots 31 (hair) and 41 (long hair). They are cloth and have zero weight, value or armor rating. They are set to match the player characters hair color. This will also work on followers whom have their hair color set in CK, not just in the facegen data.

All ESPs are flagged ESL, so they will not take up a mod slot.
  
  
Notes: If you have Racemenu installed, the wigs should match your existing hair color for player character and NPC that have hair color in CK, not just facegen. If you don't have Racemenu installed or have issues, try this mod: [Sync Wig Hair Color](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/100858) (works fine in SSE).[/font]
  
  
  
Say what now?
  
  
[font=Arial]If you are not familiar with the terminology "Racemenu hairs" are those that you can select during character creation, or at anytime by entering the console and typing showracemenu. Wigs are basically helmets that are nice to have to give to followers, assign to outfits, etc. So, in this one mod you get the best of both worlds.

Building a collision body: 
  
  
[font=Arial]Included are bodyslide files for the collision body for: CBBE 3BA/3BBB, BHUNP and HIMBO. Note however that it can be made to work with any body type by creating a similar shape with one of these existing bodies. For example you can use the HIMBO sliders for any male type like SAM or vanilla. It does not have to be exact, you are just creating a crude invisible body for the hair to collide with.
  
  
To build in Bodyslide type "xing" into the Outfit Filter box and then select your preset. Next check the build morphs box before hitting the Batch Build button. When prompted use the radio buttons to select your desired body type: CBBE 3BA, BHUNP or HIMBO and press OK.
  
  
Note: There is only one collision body, so if you switch from male to female or vise versa, it may be necessary to rebuild the collision body in Bodyslide. I have found that the "Simple" preset included with HIMBO is a decent compromise that works pretty well for both male and females that don't have grossly exaggerated features.
  
  
  
**Changes from the original**[/font][Dint999 collection](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/60730)[font=Arial] - removed the need for a "collision ring", fixed a collision issue with one of the best hairs in the pack, removed redundant hairs and names. Fixed mesh tint settings. Renamed everything for tidiness. Removed hairline from shaved head wigs, due to clipping issues. Removed noise values. Removed incorrect keywords. Removed weight, value and armor rating. Changed from light armor to cloth to prevent perk issues. A few hairs still need tweaking. Wigs use only slot 31 (hair) and 41 (long hair). Bodyslide keyword Dint.[/font]
  
  
[Fuse00 collection](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57179)[font=Arial] - removed the need for a "collision ring", fixed a collision issue with one of the hairs in the pack, reduced hair shine, optimized and resized meshes. Removed non physics hairs. Renamed everything for tidiness. Removed noise values. Removed incorrect keywords. Removed weight, value and armor rating. This set needs a retexture and physics tweaks.
