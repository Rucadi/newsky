Hi!
  
I don’t like the default eye shape in HPH, and [EFM](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35785)﻿ isn’t any better for my taste, so I made my own shape and improved it for both male and female :)**
  
**This** shape is available via a slider in the **EYE TAB** to avoid any conflicts.
  
  
**Be sure** to set **EYE SHAPE** to **0** before making adjustments, or you’ll end up creating your eyes on top of the old presets.
  
It should look like this:

**"Is it compatible with...?"** **YES**, it is.
  
The only requirement is **High Poly Head** - without it, my mod won’t do anything.
