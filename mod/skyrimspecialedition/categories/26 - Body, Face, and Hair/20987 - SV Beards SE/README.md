**SV Beards SE**
  
  
  
  
SV Beards v.2.1 adds 120 new beard combos to the facial hair slider for males in Skyrim. They are made from vanilla assets, and put together differently to make new combinations. Please see above video. The styles are pretty random so you'll have to scroll thru to check them all out. (This mod only adds new beard combinations so it will work with any beard texture replacers.) To those of you who have used the oldrim version, I have added an extra 7 styles to this new Special Edition version.
  
  
I made this mod years ago, and have been using it for most of my characters/npc’s. This mod was inspired by DarkestLycan’s - [Muttonchops Goatees Handlebars and Lowcut Mohawks mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49201) here on Nexus(Go check it out!). He said he didn’t mind me releasing these a long time ago so I have had them posted up on my [Tumblr Blog](http://shadowtigers.tumblr.com/post/135867651864/), but I've noticed a lot more people seem to be using it now adays so I figured I would post it here on Nexus for anyones mod needs (Hopefully he won't mind me releasing it here on Nexus after all this time). I’m sorry I didn’t have the energy to create a image layout for every beard combo. (If anyone would like to help out with screenshots that would be awesome.) (The video is for the LE version, but it's the same mod +7 new combos. You guys get the idea.)
