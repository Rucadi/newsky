UPDATE for KS Hairs 1.9 [HERE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64707) by the lovely [dovaya](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/37990475)! <3
  
  
This started as an update to [Rough hair for KS Hairdos SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16582) by Shiva182, a retexture using [these textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/79735) by jasperthegnome for [KS Hairdos](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6817) by Kalilies. But, it kind of bloated out of control and I ended up remaking every single texture. Kalilies has made a LOT of updates to the hairs from KS Hairdos 1.6 (version the original retexture uses) to 1.7, like improving the alpha/transparency layers for all hairs - comparison in pictures, the difference is huge! That also made some textures from 1.6 to have some bugs when used with 1.7 meshes, so those are now **fixed** too.
  
  
I also disliked how "shaggy" some hairstyles looked, so my **edited textures are a bit smoother** than the original Salt & Wind ones.
  
  
I also wanted to make a 1.7 compatible **.esp replacer** [like this one](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12004) by Sokkvabekk to reduce the female hairstyles down. The hairs are not deleted, only removed from player character, so it *should* work with mods that depend on KS hairs. Male hairs are not touched, as they have so little to begin with! What styles stayed and did not are purely based on my Immaculate(tm) tastes, and there are some longer styles not included in Sokkvahbekk's original vision. There's nothing wrong with the hairs I deleted, but I just wanted to narrow the selection by removing styles very similar to one another. Complete list with pictures in images.
  
  
There is also an **optional blank hairline texture** I made for myself to make the hairs look good on my Ethereal Elven Overhaul Altmer character, as the hairline was poking through the hair because the EEO head is shaped differently. Not recommended unless you have the same problem yourself, as some hairs will have slight floating effects without the hairline (but nothing too major).
  
  
**tl;dr**

  
* Salt & Wind textures for KS Hairdos SE v.1.7
slightly smoother texture than original Salt & Wind
  
* optional .esp replacer - female hairs reduced from 792 to 333
optional blank hairline texture to fix problems with different shaped heads - *only use if you have the issue pictured in images*
