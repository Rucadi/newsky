# OActorOpacity - Customizable Transparency for Actors in OStim Standalone
- Author: daubuoi
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/143624


Sometimes, in an OStim scene, you want to fully observe a specific actor, but another actor gets in the way, which can be frustrating. That’s why this mod was created! It allows you to make unwanted actors transparent so you can focus on the ones you want to see more clearly.
  
  
You can adjust their transparency level or even make them disappear completely if desired.

[size=4]Upgrading
  
  
Okay, for those who are using version 1 and are preparing to update to version 1.1:
  
  
You will need to update on a clean save (meaning a save that hasn’t had this mod installed before) or start the new game. You can also clean an existing save to update without causing errors. You can do this just like how you updated OStim. If you’re not sure how to clean a save file, the method is mentioned in the description of the Ostim Standalone mod under the 'Upgrading' section; just follow the same procedure for this mod.
