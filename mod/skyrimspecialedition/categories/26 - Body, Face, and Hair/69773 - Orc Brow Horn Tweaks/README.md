# Orc Brow Horn Tweaks
- Author: SassiestAssassin
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

These are just some optional tweaks I came up with while working on my upcoming orc NPC overhaul. You can run any combination of these together or run one separately, any way you want.
  
  
**--Option 0: Brow Horns Don't Change Color-**  removed the shader flag that changed the brow horns color to match skin tone. Now they actually look like horns. Please note, this will show up on your player character, but will not show on NPCs without redoing facegen files. *Mesh replacer.*
  
**--Option 1: Tweaked Texture-** ran the diffuse through ESGARN and made it lighter. Nothing to write home about, but I couldn't find a mod that covered it. Best used in combination with Brow Horns Don't Change Color, otherwise they will be skintone tinted. *Texture replacer.*
  
**--Option 2: Brow Horns as Scars-** adds copies of each brow horn into the scar category, to allow for different combinations of eyebrows/horns. I recommend using with [More Scars](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44222), so that you can have brow horns, your choice of eyebrows, and facial scarring all at the same time. *ESPFE.*
  
High Poly Head versions are available. Additional version that replaces vanilla horn meshes with high poly versions is now available as well.
  
Mesh patch available for [Orc Horns Extra](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/69838) (LE, but converts fine to SE.) (Highly recommended.)

If you want to use these in an NPC mod, go for it (preferably with credit/link, but whatevs)
