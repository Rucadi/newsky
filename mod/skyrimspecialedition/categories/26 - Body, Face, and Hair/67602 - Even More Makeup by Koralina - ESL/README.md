There are many similar mods out there but with this one, **you can do whatever you want.**
  
The only condition is that you **ALWAYS credit me.**
  
Feel free to use this in your own presets and NPC overhauls **without asking me for permission.**
  
Also **earn Donation Points or sell your mods** if you like.
  
  
  
I recommend using  [Bits and pieces female skin mashup](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65274)

Soo why another makeup mod? Well, I'm better skilled in Photoshop painting now and I was playing with new brushes. Also, I treat this mod as my personal resource. My next NPCs will use it for sure, as I prepared certain overlays for selected NPCs. I also think it is comprehensive and useful enough to publish it for other modders or just players who want to have a huge choice of makeup. 
  
  
But I still recommend using [Koralina's Makeup Tweaks - 4k 2k](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63024) if you like eyeliners.
