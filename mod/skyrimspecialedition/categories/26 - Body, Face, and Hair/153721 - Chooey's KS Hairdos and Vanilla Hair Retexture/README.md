**Chooey's KS Hairdos and Vanilla Hair Retexture**
  
  
**For the KS Hairdo's Retexture:**
  
  
I have been using ShinglesCat's [KS Hairdos retexture](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38820) for years but I wanted to have something less rough and gritty. The default KS Hairdos textures were okay but some of them had intense toning. So I made this mod as an in-between with those two mods.
  
  
> ***KS Hairdo Retexture Features:**
>   
>   
> ✧ Covers **930** different hair textures from KS Hairdos - with a custom painted texture.
>   
>   
> ✧ Updated up to the **1.1.0** version of KS Hairdos.
>   
>   
> ✧ No .esp.
>   
>   
> ✧ Vanilla-Match and Grayscaled texture options available.
>   
>   
> ✧ You can uninstall this mod at any time and updates will not break your modlist.
>   
>   
> ✧ There is an optional file for [KS Hairdos - HDT SMP (Physics)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31300) if you use that mod.*

**For the Vanilla Hair Retexture:**
  
  
I also retextured the vanilla hair using the newly drawn base that I use for my KS Hairdo Retexture. I blended it with a little of the base vanilla textures so keep that same feeling but introducing that clean smoothing.
  
  
I tested my retexture with [Vanilla Hair Remake](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63979)﻿, good mod check it out.
