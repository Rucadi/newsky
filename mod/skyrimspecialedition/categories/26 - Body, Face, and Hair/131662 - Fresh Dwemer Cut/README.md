Hairstyle inspired by some Dwemer Fanart. Has SMP physics. There are two variants, one with a headpiece, one without.
  
  
I commissioned [Everglaid](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Everglaid/about-me?gameId=1704) and [Willowy](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/willowy1/about-me) to make this about 11 months ago, meaning I did NOT make this, they did. They've now given me permission to upload it here.
  
  
The screenshots also belong to them. I was too lazy to make new ones, but I tested it and it works.﻿
  
  
Shouldn't conflict with anything.
  
  
Requires [Faster HMP SMP
