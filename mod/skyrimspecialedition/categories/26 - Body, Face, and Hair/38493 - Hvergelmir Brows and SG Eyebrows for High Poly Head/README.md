[More High Poly Head Eyebrows Patch Hub by Nekomata](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43470)﻿ <<< Has a couple more eyebrow mods converted for SE
  
  
You can find LE sister mod here: [High Poly Eyebrows Patch Hub](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/105509)
  
  
**About**
  
  
Modded eyebrows have clipping issues on High poly Head i noticed. This can be solved in sculpt but since its easy, i made this mod. Maybe someone else will find it useful.  
  
  
It is useful if you want to use the modded eyebrows on your character with high poly head. Also useful if you want to make NPC overhaul with high poly heads and want these eyebrows, you can use this mod as template.
  
  
You must download requirement files. This mod includes no texture or mesh. It is ESP replacer (Both flagged ESL). If you want standalone for some reason, you can rename ESP. 
  
  
I can do same for other eyebrow non-replacer mods. Let me know.
