Easily the best preset I've ever made.

Low weight characters (0-30) have this nice, delicate form. Slightly upturned breasts that are perky, with hips that transition gracefully into the waist.
  
  
Mid weight characters (30-65) have this more developed form. Breasts start to gain more voluptuousness, and the hips become slightly wider.
  
  
High weight characters (65-100) have a rocking body. Generous breasts that bounce perfectly, and hips that would make Shakira jealous.
  
  
I like variety in my Skyrim, but I also wanted something that works well with HDTSMP/CBPC physics for EVERY weight, not just the high ones.

Dorian Imperious is a fully voiced, fully romanceable follower with a unique and dynamic backstory, and a rich and deep lore surrounding him.
  
The entire voice cast is professionally done. (When I say professional, I mean professional. Industry veterans.)
  
  
So far I've put over 200 hours into creating Dorian's story, and every Patron goes towards supporting the voice talent.
  
  
Also, I plan to upload a video on how to use SSE Nif Optimizer and NifMerge to get your Racemenu morphs to play nice with the Creation Kit generated NIF ;) that way you can doll your beauties up as much as you want AND have them look the same in game ;)
