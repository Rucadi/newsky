**[font=Verdana]Dibellan - Simply Better Bits [/font]**
  
[font=Courier New]\*for '**Bits & Pieces**'[/font]

[font=Tahoma]'[Bits & Pieces](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65274)﻿' - 3BA/BHUNP has lots of great pieces, now it also gets great 'Bits', courtesy of a little [Dibellan](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63151)﻿ skin treatment.
  
  
A complete re-master of my [Dibellan-TrueSkin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63151)﻿ textures to work as a replacer for all [3BA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30174)﻿ or [BHUNP](http://https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31126)﻿ genitals[/font]

  
  

  
[left]* Available in 4k or 2K.
New Diffuse, Normal, Specular, and Sub-surface Maps
  
* Works well with every skin tone I have tested, except demons, especially blue ones ;)
No, I will not be releasing more options... this is a one and done!

**[font=Tahoma]\*\*\*Will work with any CBBE-3BA or BHUNP Body Texture, but it is designed for BNP\*\*\*[/font]

 
  
  
  
Common Knowledge, and things that affect the 3BA/BHUNP genitals in general... ie, not my problem ;)**
  

  
1. Install after BNP and/or any other mod that replaces the default 3BA/BHUNP genitalia textures, \*\*load order matters.\*\*
Lighting affects everything, sometimes the textures appear lighter, sometimes they appear darker. Because... Science!!!
  
2. Your ENB and shader mods affect everything.
The genital is a separate mesh, so... the Normal maps render shadows differently than the crotch.
  
3. The shader settings of the genital mesh tend to make the labia appear to glow under certain conditions.
Custom 3BA Followers with their own skin textures rarely include custom paths for genitals/textures, so they fall back on the default. which this replaces, might look a little dark on pale skin followers like Snow Elves or 'Ashe', etc. (adjusting the sliders for 'Tight-Up', and 'Neat', in Bodyslide for custom followers will help hide the darker 'cleft of Venus').
