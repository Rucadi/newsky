I made these a like a year ago, it's about time I finish making the plugin and share them. I plan to make and share many more overlay tattoos like these (hopefully not in a year ?), and maybe other overlays in the future. I like to make and share the overlays I always wanted when I started back up modding again in ~2023. It sparked my curiosity to learn all things textures, and further modding from there. Overlays can go a long way in customizing and highlighting your character and their style.
  
  
My minimum viable product I wanted to create was to make these for 3BA and create this mod page. I'll look at baking/reapplying these to BHUNP & UBE before moving to my next project.
  
  
I experimented with a couple of these overlays, adding a greyscale gradient to them so that you can apply a gradient glow to them in RaceMenu. Go experiment with those Womb tattoos. If people like it, I'll try to do more like that in the future. I did notice with my ENB (Cabbage) it interacts.. interestingly with Subsurface Scattering.

Installation is genuinely as shrimple as downloading and installing. Assuming you have installed the requirements correctly, you will have new entries under the [Body Paint], [Makeup], [Hands], and [Face Paint] tabs. You can filter your search with "Infernal Inks".
  
  
There are alterations to can make to your SKSE settings to enable higher resolution overlays. If your overlays look unclear or blurry in game you may attempt this to improve them. Open/create "SKSE/SKSE.ini" and make this change:

```
﻿[Display]
  
iTintTextureResolution=2048 //this is for 2K, set this to 4096 for 4K resolution
```

  

Additional recommended changes to SKSE.ini you may consider:

```
﻿[General]
  
EnableDiagnostics=0
  
ClearInvalidRegistrations=1
  
[Memory]
  
defaultHeapInitialAllocMB=768
  
scrapHeapSizeMB=256
```

To all these wonderful screenarchers for providing their beautiful shots. Go check out their content and show them some love! To them - I'm your biggest fan. Sharing mods is fun, but Virtual Photography is what keeps me here. All of you, not just those showcasing here, inspire me deeply to continue creating.

The original artists of these tattoo designs: I sourced the artwork from various places on the internet, then applied them to the UV as best as I could. It's rather difficult to track their origins, as they were reposted 30,817 times across the internet. If you created any of this art, and feel the need to, please reach out to me about its use here.
