*[font=Georgia]When the children of our people came of age, they earn the privilege of wearing the vallaslin, the blood writing. It sets us apart from the shemlen, and from the elves who have thrown their lot in with them. It reminds us that we will never again surrender our traditions and beliefs.[/font]*
  
*—From [Codex entry: Vallaslin: Blood Writing](http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Codex_entry:_Vallaslin:_Blood_Writing)*

This is a racemenu plugin that adds 30 Dalish Vallaslin face tattoo's to your makeup section. Both male and female. Created by [Tropelicious](https://www.nexusmods.com/dragonageinquisition/users/25493724/?) :)
  
I finished DAI a bit ago and really missed Tropelicious' tattoo's so I asked for permission to port them to Skyrim. If you currently play DAI (heck even if you don't) please go to Tropelicious' mod page (link below) download and endorse their original mod. You won't regret it! They're just as stunning in DAI as they are in Skyrim!
  
  
Each Dalish Vallaslin is named appropriately to their names in DAI. But some have a couple different variations of appearance in game.
  
  
Their names are; Andruil, Dirthamen, Elgar'nan, Falon'din, Ghilan'nain,
  
June, Mythal and Sylaise.
  
  
The only ones that aren't named this are the v2.4 face tattoos. I just numbered them xD
  
I am aware that one of the Vallaslin is incorrectly named as well.
  
This is just a quick port from my LE version to SE. I'll get around to fixing it someday.

You'll find both male and female Vallaslin's under the Makeup tab. The female name begins with FDV (Female Dalish Vallaslin).
  
Males begin with MDV (Male Dalish Vallislin).
