Nord female face presets for RaceMenu and Enhanced Character Edit.
  
  
Please see the stickies for a list of mods that I use.
  
  
  
**Requirements:**
  
RaceMenu Presets require [RaceMenu SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19080).
  
  
ECE CME Slots require [Enhanced Character Edit SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12302).
  
  
I wrote an article on where ECE and RaceMenu preset folders are located and how the presets can be loaded. **This is very important for first time ECE users** as this folder will not be created automatically when you install ECE because the folder is not in the Skyrim SE Data folder.
  
  
The article can be viewed via the Articles Tab above or using this link: [Important Information for ECE and RaceMenu Users](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/411)
