Since [MFA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/97157) is on my dead account, I haven't had access to updating that mod any further per se. Anyway, this patch improves the headparts for the vampire lord based on that mod. I did some further editing to the head meshes and tri files, restored the weightmapping for the jaw and even fixed that one infamous unweighted vertex point on the female head.
