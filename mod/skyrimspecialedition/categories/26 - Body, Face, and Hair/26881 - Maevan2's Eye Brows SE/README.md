**What this mod does**
  
Depending on what you choose in the FOMod, you can replace the 11 vanilla female eyebrows and/or get 18 standalone eyebrows (11 vanilla + 7 new ones)
  
You can get all brows in dynamic colors (same as your hair color) or they're always black.
  
  
**What I've changed**
  
I have compressed the High res brows to BC7 (they were uncompressed before) and I have also used them to get higher quality of the Medium and Low res brows, so they're also in BC7 instead of BC3.
  
I have also added a ESPFE version of the ESP, you'll choose in the FOMod which one you want. FormIDs are compressed, so don't use on a saved game where you've had this mod before.
