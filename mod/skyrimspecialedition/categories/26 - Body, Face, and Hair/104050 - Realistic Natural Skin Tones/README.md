When you go into character creation ( console ~ ShowRaceMenu) this will add 21 skin natural skin tones to the following races:
  
Redguard
  
Breton
  
Imperial
  
High Elf
  
Nord
  
Wood Elf
  
  
This will work for ECE and RaceMenu users. Also works on vanilla character creation menu if anyone wants to port to consoles(even PS4/5). Works on both male and female characters.
  
  
TIP:
  
  
These are natural skin tones and may appear bright in your game, much of it depends on your settings and ENB but if some of the color tones do appear too bright in your game, simply adjust the brightness with RM or ECE sliders.
