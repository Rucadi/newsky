**Description**
  
Feature:

The Eyes of Beauty offers many new eyes textures for player and NPCs. All texture are high resolution and are made for the best result in Skyrim. No other eyes will be so real and unique.
  
  
The download section offers you many choices:

**\*\*You can either install one or several packs. If you want Player eyes AND NPC's, then you'll have to install BOTH.**
  
**Recommendation**
  
This mod will go along well with [Eye Normal Map Fix SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5445). Let this mod overwrite TEOB.
  
[The Eyes Of Beauty - Vampire Eyes SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15910) is superior than the original dawnguard eyes. Let this mod overwrite TEOB NPC.

**THE EYES OF BEAUTY**
  
  
You are a sky of autumn, pale and rose;
  
But all the sea of sadness in my blood
  
Surges, and ebbing, leaves my lips morose,
  
Salt with the memory of the bitter flood.
  
  
In vain your hand glides my faint bosom o'er,
  
That which you seek, beloved, is desecrate
  
By woman's tooth and talon; ah, no more
  
Seek in me for a heart which those dogs ate.
  
  
It is a ruin where the jackals rest,
  
And rend and tear and glut themselves and slay--
  
A perfume swims about your naked breast!
  
  
Beauty, hard scourge of spirits, have your way!
  
With flame-like eyes that at bright feasts have flared
  
Burn up these tatters that the beasts have spared!
