Nobody really knows what the Tsaesci looked like, did they look like snake people? Were they just humans shrouded in legends?
  
If you want to roleplay with the races added by **Lost Races of Nirn**, now you can have a new female skin texture compatible with CBBE-based bodies.
  
  
I provide two options:
  
  
- **Snake skin**: a mashup with the vanilla Argonian skin, if you believe in their snake-like features.
  
  
- **Human skin**: if you think they were just humans or shapeshifters that should have a fully human form.
  
  
The snake skin is not 100% perfect, I tried my best to blend it but there are still a few seams on the feet area, I will probably try to fix them in future updates but I wanted to get this out early so I can go on working on my presets.
  
  
I had to do an **ESP file (flagged as light)** to repath the textures because some were referring to the vanilla Argonian and would cause seams and other issues.
  
  
I will probably make the male skin too at some point if there are no better options available.
