[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]Overview
  
  
**Bottom-Heavy** is a 3BA BodySlide preset that creates a pear-shaped body with a thick bottom and thighs that taper up to smaller, perkier breasts. It is weighted 0-100 with the lower end being an A/B cup and the upper end being a C/D cup. The rest of the figure changes slightly to remain in proportion.
