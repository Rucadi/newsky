If you enjoy these please endorse! o/
  
I'd love to add some more screenshots (sfw) to this mod's media. If you upload any that you wouldn't mind showcased here please let me know or say so in the description, and I'll see if I can place them up there.
  
  
I didn't use any eyebrows from my Oldrim mod, but since adding NG to the name of improved reiterations seems to be the trend I wanna be trendy too! \o/
  
  
[font=Courier New]**Contents:**[/font]
  
These are hand drawn eyebrow textures made in Krita with a simple brush. They're standalone and come in both vanilla brow shape and high poly head brow shape, install either or both. Their resolution is 1024 x 512.

Install it with your favorite mod manager, it's a FOMod installer.
  
  
[font=Courier New]**F.A.Q.:**[/font]
  
**Can I use this in my follower or appearance overhaul ?**
  
As long as it's freely distributed, **yes**. And no need to credit me, although it is appreciated.
  
  
**Will more eyebrows be added ?**
  
While for the time being I don't plan to, if there's a shape you REALLY want to see ingame you can link me a reference in the comments and I can have a look at it. If it's something I'd also like to have I might try to add it eventually.
  
  
[font=Courier New]**Coming soon:**[/font]
  

  
* Updating my recent releases during the following days/weeks.
Got a few things in mind, but it depends on how far I can take up modding for the time being. [Buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/jerok)﻿ if you'd like to help fuel that onwards.
