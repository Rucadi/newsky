> ﻿**By default, Skyrim will change your eyes to the standard vampire eye that is used by all vampire races. It will also force you to use the vampire face part even if you switch it to high poly. This mod will disable the features that are automatically applied when you become a vampire and allow you to retain your appearance or customize your current preset.**

![](https://i.ibb.co/nBDw7fb/Nice-Png-vampire-png-972090.png)](https://ibb.co/684yHbm)﻿FOR MALE VAMPIRES ONLY
  

  
* To use, change the desired eyes in Racemenu before you become a vampire.

  
* [b]There is a bug that will revert your eyes to whatever you have set before becoming a vampire and will not allow you to change them once your race changes. ( working on fix)**
  
**To fix this use "player.setrace (your race)"**
  
- **Ex: "nordrace", "bretonrace", etc.)**
**Change your eyes then change your race back to a vampire with "player.setrace (your race)vampire" EX: nordracevampire, bretonracevampire, etc.**
