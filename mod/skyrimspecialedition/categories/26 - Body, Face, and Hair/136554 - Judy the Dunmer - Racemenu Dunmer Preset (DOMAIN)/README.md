This is an upload of a Racemenu preset for @daedaddy 's DOMAIN face preset contest. Made with the DOMAIN mod collection installed so you will also most likely need to be using that collection in order for her to look correct.
  
  
Installation/Use:
  
  
Vortex install should work fine but you can also do it manually:
  
Drag and drop the .jslot file into the presets folder found at
  
  
Skyrim Special Edition\Data\SKSE\plugins\CharGen\Presets
  
  
Choose Dark Elf race, change gender to female, then go to the presets column and load the preset file (judy final) from there. Enjoy.
  
  
Also including the .nif and .dds files in the files section in case you need them for anything.
