I never liked the waxy look of fur on vanilla Khajiits so when I decided to change things up a bit and play a Khajiit on a VR playthrough I quickly realized I needed to do something drastic if I wanted immersion. This is the result of work stretching back for years and recently adapted for use on these textures to help [XilaMonstrr](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/126616023) with [her version of CoverKhajiits](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71067) which was not quite compatible with all bodies and had issues such as only being mapped for digitigrade feet. The textures have been enhanced and made compatible with (hopefully) all bodies.
  
  
The real magic in this mod is the fur normal mapping that has been hand drawn with some help from my real cat to look like real fur and add a sense of realism you can only really appreciate while watching the lights move around your character in game. This also fixes a suspected bug with the vanilla tail normal maps having swapped blue/green channels and adds details such as shiny naturally faceted nails and tons of other details. 
  
  
**INSTALLATION:**
  
1. Choose the correct core files for the body mod(s) you use. (these are only textures and will not change you body alone!)
  
2. Install with your preferred mod loader with the included FOMOD installer. Make sure to choose the correct feet type (vanilla or digitigrade).
  
3. Choose the optional plugin patch file if you wish to set Khajiit to use their own subsurface scattering textures **only** if you use one of my textures on both genders! It may cause crashes otherwise, but should be fine if you overwrite my mod or let another mod take priority over mine as the patch just needs the new \_sk textures to be in both khajiit folders. There is a version that adds new colorful skin, hair, and warpaint tint colors as well, but I would not choose that one if you have any other mods that edit such things as they may conflict.
  
4. If prompted by your mod loader load these files AFTER existing file conflicts.
  
5. (SoS users only) You may wish to download this patch from the LL website after installing a SoS/HIMBO option if you use SoS Full or SoS Light for male nudity: [LL SoS Patch Files](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/26306-terres-4k-fur-textures-for-coverkhajiits-sos-patches/) (Thanks to rydoq for hosting this for me!)﻿
  
  
I recommended you use [CoverKhajiits - Face Textures 4K SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71067) if you are not installing 3D fur heads from my [Khajiit Has Hairs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/143427)﻿ mod.
  
The Digitigrade textures are for [Digitigrade Beast Races for Skyrim SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1975). If you use [Khajiit Paw](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43511) or my 3D fur version of that mod in [Khajiit Has Hairs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/143427)﻿ then download the optional Khajiit Paw patch files.
  
  
UNINSTALLATION:
  
1. Disable or delete this mod in your preferred mod loader or manually delete the files you added in manual installation.
  
  
**COMPATIBILITY:**
  
Use the esp patch only if you have a v2.0 or higher version of my textures installed for both genders. Use the simple no-tint patch if any of your mods alter skin, hair, or paint tints, and don't use the patch at all if you don't really notice or care about any lighting issue on the wrist seams as it is optional and may not even show a noticeable improvement for many users. The rest of this mod is texture only and should not edit code or conflict with any mods that do not alter the looks of Khajiits. Load this mod last to ensure the textures look as intended in game, if another mod overwrites files from this mod reinstall over that mod if you notice undesired visual issues have appeared. The detailed textures may cause a slight performance hit on lower end machines. This mod was originally designed for VR and should be fully VR compatible.
  
  
**Thank you to [Becofi](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1SJDZOOMCT13tBNncjrZ2g)﻿ for the screenshots****This mod is included in the Nexus Collection, [Proud & Beastly Beasts](https://next.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/collections/3qkwfw). Check that out for a bunch of great beauty mods for Beast Races!**
  
  
I tried to make versions compatible with as many versions of each body mod that I could find, but if you find a body variant or mod that is not compatible with any of the textures here feel free to comment on this mod page and show pictures if possible and I *may* be able to create a patch or new version that solves your compatibility issues.
  
  
Possible Common Issues/ Q&A:
  
Q: My character skin looks wrong on my body!
  
A: You likely downloaded the wrong version for the body mod you are using, check your mod list and try other versions or install the correct body meshes before requesting a fix.
  
  
Q: My SoS male character has private bits and feet not showing where they should be or fur colors do not match privates!
  
A: This mod only includes the body textures due to permissions issues, download this patch on the LL website if you would like matching male private textures or a SoS Light patch which will fix foot and private texture issues: [LL SoS Patch Files](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/26306-terres-4k-fur-textures-for-coverkhajiits-sos-patches/)﻿
  
  
Q: My UNP character has the breasts mapped wrong and I installed the UNP textures!
  
A: You might be using a UNP slider set of the CBBE body and need the CBBE texture.
  
  
Q: I don't want nudity, have a SFW version?
  
A: Most body mods have a never-nude option you can use or you can use the default/vanilla game bodies. This mod only effects the body textures and does not add nudity alone. 
  
  
If you enjoy this mod feel free to leave comments or post about any issues or requests you might have. I can not guarantee anything, but I may try developing more fur patterns and colors or reskin other races like argonians if this project turns out to be popular enough. This is my first publicly released mod so forgive me if there are any initial issues or file mix-ups. There were a lot of body mods and it has been a lot to keep track of.
