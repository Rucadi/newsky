[Even More Eyes LE](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/114103)
  
  
  
Installation:**
  
Manually or with your mod manager
  
  
  
**This is not a replacer!**
  
  
  
I've been working on this project for half of this year. The textures for this mod are carefully painted and selected, with high-quality image compression for the best screen archery experience. Every piece of texture is entirely new, so you will not see a vanilla cubemap or environment mask here. The eyes are completely standalone. Work both for males and females, there is no race restriction except for beasts. 
  
I also plan to update this mod and add more variants.
  
  
  
**What's inside?**
  

  
* 11 albino eyes variants, with white eyelashes
31 unnatural or semi-realistic eye variants, various lash colors
  
* 14 blue eye variants, black eyelashes
10 brown eye variants, black eyelashes
  
* 7 green eye variants, black eyelashes
5 maps in one texture: diffuse (color), normal, environment, glow, cubemap
  

  
  
**The plugin is ESL flagged, so it won't count in your load order**
  
**Take a look at the permissions before using in your own mods!**
