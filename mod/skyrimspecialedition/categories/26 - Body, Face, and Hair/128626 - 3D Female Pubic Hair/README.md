Adds 43 mesh-based pubic hairstyles for female characters applied through [TNG](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/104215). (rudimentary SoS patch now available, maybe someone will make a patch with full MCM support)
  
  
Matches the color of the character's hair through [Hair Colour Sync](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/121751). Non-AE users try [Hair Colour Sync NG](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/156414).
  
  
Requires TNG distribution and either CBBE 3BA or BHUNP.
  
  
Some options contain a lot of polygons and might impact performance. For people on modern computers as long as you don't have 30 naked characters in a single room it should probably be fine since it will normally be hidden on clothed characters.
  
  
It would probably be a lot more practical to use hair cards and textures instead of having individual hair strands, but I don't know how to do that so this is what you will get.
  
  
Bodyslide files for CBBE 3BA are included in the main files. BHUNP and UBE bodyslides available in optional files. No prebuilt meshes, batch building meshes required before use.
