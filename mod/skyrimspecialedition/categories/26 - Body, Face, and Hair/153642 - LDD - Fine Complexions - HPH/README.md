**Hi!**
  
**I was a bit tired of seeing flat-faced males with barely any detail on them - unless you used ten layers of makeup.
  
And when I’m tired of something, I usually fix it.**
  
  
This mod adds **high-quality** male complexions for precise character customization, with **60** combinations.
  
It helps make characters **more immersive**, **expressive**, and definitely **more unique**.
  
  
No makeup. **No tryharding**. Just complexions.

**3 Aging stages -** detailed description
  
  
Spoiler• **Clean** (no aging, no simulated nose AO) - this variant **mainly includes eye AO and detailers**. It’s a great choice for players who want to **enhance** their character’s face **without adding** any signs of aging or roughness, or who simply prefer a **very soft look**.
  
  
• **Young** - includes simulated **nose AO**, **eye AO**, and **all the detailing**. Best suited for **characters aged around 20-35**.
  
  
• **Older** - this version features **subtle but visible wrinkles** and **clear signs of aging**. I kept it toned down, because in my opinion, most aging complexions tend to be too strong and make different characters look too similar. Best suited for **characters aged around 30–50**.
  
**5 Types of simulated eye AO -**detailed description
  
  
Spoiler• **Default** - **suitable for all characters**; just a simple option if you're going for a more “regular” or neutral look.
  
  
• **Hunter** - made with **confident**, **striking young** characters in mind. It adds a **heavier effect**, especially on the eyelids, creating a sharp, bold, and slightly **sassy appearance**.
  
  
• **Tired** - **3 stages** of tiredness: from “**I just woke up**” to “**Damn, I could use a break**” to full-on “**Where am I?**” eyes. **I love this one** because it opens up so many possibilities: **tired peasants**, **rough or completely broken warriors**, **overwhelmed thinkers**, or just someone who’s had a **long** day… there are too many scenarios to name them all!
  
**2 Types of details -**detailed description
  
  
Spoiler• **Freckled** - as the name suggests: subtle, natural freckles. **Nothing overwhelming**, softly blended into the skin to **add charm without stealing the spotlight**.
  
  
• **Pimples** - speaks for itself: light, realistic pimples. Scattered mostly around the cheeks, with a few on the forehead to **avoid** a “template” feel. **Blends naturally into the face**.
  
  
These are great for adding personality, flaws, or a lived-in feel to your characters - **especially** **when you're tired of everyone looking airbrushed**.
  
**Simulated nose AO -**detailed description
  
  
Spoiler• **Simulated nose AO** is a matter of **preference** and point of view. To me, noses on HPH heads are **very flat** and almost **blend into the face**. In preview gifs, when switching from the version without AO to the younger or older version, you can see a **big** contrast change around the nose. **This is intentional** and **works well** in the game.
  
  
Notice the nostrils - they now have **depth** and are **no longer too bright**. The nose wings also have **better shape and depth**. The cheeks **contrast better** with the nose.
  
**Overall**, the face has more **depth** and **detail**, looking more **natural**, **lively**, and **expressive**, not plastic.

**This mod** **doesn’t have any requirements** on its own and will work just fine with the base game, but...
  
  
Because it touches race records, **it would** normally be incompatible with any race overhauls. **I went through the trouble** of patching the **most popular** ones and made four different versions of the mod, depending on which race overhaul you have installed - if any. **Everything’s included** in the FOMOD.
  
  
**Full compatibility, yay!**
  
Just **make sure** my mod loads after any race overhaul you’re using. **Putting it last** in your load order is the **safest** choice.
