I couldn't find a muscle slider mod for the vanilla female body, so I made one using tweaked normal maps from the amazing [Reverie - Skin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64314) by Novelyst.
  
  
This mod adds dynamic muscularity that scales with character body weight, so that human and mer women will be less muscular at lower weights and more muscular at higher weights. There are 11 increments, from weight 0 to 100. The overall effect is on the subtle side as these things go.
  
  
I've included two non-slider body normal maps in the optional files which I spliced together in the process of creating this mod, for anyone who might want them.
  
  
*What about beast races and non-vanilla bodies?*
  
Several other mods include muscle slider options for beast races and CBBE, UNP, etc.
  
Update 3/23/25 - I added a version for CBBE.
  
  
*Will you make a male version?*
  
I wanted to, but couldn't find a good set of normal maps to use as a base, and don't have the skill to make them myself. (Tempered Skin for Males has some options, but while I've happily used Tempered Males in the past, for some reason it doesn't look good with my current ENB/LO). At any rate, there are muscle slider options available on the Nexus that work with vanilla males.
  
  
*What about different muscle sliders for different races?*
  
Maybe. I'm toying with the idea. Watch this space. (Or don't. I'm not the boss of you.)
  
  
Requirements
  
[Reverie - Skin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64314) is strongly recommended but technically not required. However, this mod only contains body normal maps -- no face or hand normals, so you will want to get those from [Reverie - Skin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64314), or else you will probably get seams. Load this mod after so it can overwrite the body normals.
