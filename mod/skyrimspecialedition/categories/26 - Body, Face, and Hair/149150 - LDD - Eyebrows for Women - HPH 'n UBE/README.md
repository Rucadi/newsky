**My goal was to focus on mods dedicated to males, but well, the ladies got me.
  
This time I'd like to present you a bigger set of brows, because exactly 100 new positions.**
  
  
**FULL SUPPORT FOR VANILLA HEAD / HIGH POLY HEAD / UBE HEAD**
  
> Break the **100** positions into **20** **unique brows** and add to every single one **5** **levels of saturation**. I'm craving that whenever I use any brows, and it's **rarely** **available**.
>   
> Why? That's mostly for the character creation freaks and for people who care. You can match the color **perfectly** **to your taste**, hair color, or simply have a chance to not go bald whenever you use blonde. :)

  

  
> For HPH users, you can freely manage the shapes with sliders, meanwhile UBE users have to sweat a bit more and play with the UV Bodyslide project as well. I personally use thin and long brows, so my build is based only on:
>   
>   
> • Width Out by 20%
>   
> • Thick by 50%
>   
> • Outer Out by 20%
>   
>   
> **Features**
>   
>   
> Saturation levels - **Blonde**/**Base**/**Black**/**Base Extra**/**Black Extra**
>   
>
>   
> + Support for **blonde** hairstyles and Individual **normal** maps
