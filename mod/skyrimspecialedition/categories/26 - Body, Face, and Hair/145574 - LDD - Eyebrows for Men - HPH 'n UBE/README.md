**The idea**
  
**As I'm learning to draw, I have decided to make a very simple yet super versatile set of brows for men. There are 5 different textures, which are extended to 2 different shapes, and ALL of them have different levels of saturation. This means there are over 40****new positions to choose from.**
  
  
**Textures are showcased in the attached images.**
  
**Let's talk about the shapes**
  
> I always struggle with getting the shape I want because either the arch is **too round**, or **too straight**. The whole brow tends to bend in a direction I don't really want it to bend, or I simply just can't hit the sweet spot. This is why I've made each of the brows have a version with their tail pointed down and up. Thanks to that, you are able to **freely create different shapes**, and most importantly, **it's easier** - without ruining the whole idea of the brow. There is **no quality loss** when making the brows thicker and wider because they're very dense and come only in **2K**, which helps a lot.

**Let's talk about the saturation levels**
  
> I wanted to make sure the color and lightness range is as flexible as possible. So I've included separate textures for each of the brows - both the tail pointed down and up. They come in **Blonde**/**Base**/**Regular**/**Extra Black** levels.
