[font=Comic Sans MS]Nails added by these mod are implemented through a new racemenu slider, these way they don't occupy a body slot. So they can freely be used along any outfit item[/font]

[font=Comic Sans MS]Nails come in 5 base shapes (Short, Long Squared, Long Almond, Longer Squared, Longer Almond & Longer Stiletto), a few patterns and many colours, making for a total of 297 options to chose from : )[/font]

[font=Comic Sans MS]By default the new slider only appears on vanilla races
  
To enable the nails slider on your non-beast custom race, you need to open the races.ini file and add the lines:
  
YourCustomRaceEditorID = sliders\human.ini
  
YourCustomRaceEditorIDVampire = sliders\human.ini[/font]

[font=Comic Sans MS]The file needs to be saved with UFT-8 encoding, so don't change that
  
  
Also, the valid races list may or may not need to be patched in the esp[/font]

[font=Comic Sans MS]Do I need racemenu to use the nails?
  
Yes, this mod won't do anything without it
  
  
Do they show up in first person?
  
No, they do not : (
  
  
Will the nails clip trough gloves?
  
Possibly, depends on the thickness of said gloves and the length of your chosen nails
  
  
Is it compatible with "Female Hands Redone"?
  
Unfortunately, this method of implementation only accepts sigle-weight meshes. So there is no way to make work with FHR : (
  
  
Will there be a version for vanilla, BHUNP, UBE, etc?
  
Not from me
  
  
May I make a patch for X body?
  
Yes you may
  
  
May I use the nails for a custom follower/NPC?
  
Yes you may
  
  
How would I implement the nails in said custom follower/NPC
  
IDK
  
  
I'm having a CTD when I open racemenu
  
You are using a RM version older than 0.4.15, aren't you? Update your RM[/font]
