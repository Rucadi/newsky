These are textures to match [these retextures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44975) I made for KS Hairdos using [Salt & Wind resources](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/79735) by jasperthegnome. He has already made [Bed Head](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8528), and I wanted something similar but softer and smoother. My textures also use the accessories from his textures, and also some hairstrand alphas from [KS Hairdos](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6817). Also, I edited the hair roots slightly after taking previews, so they should be less blocky in game!
  
  
**details;**
  

  
* 2k textures
re-done alpha/transparency layers
  
* close to matte normal/shine maps
works for all races and mods that use vanilla hair assets
  
* textures only, so no .esps to take space in your load order
should work for LE just as well
