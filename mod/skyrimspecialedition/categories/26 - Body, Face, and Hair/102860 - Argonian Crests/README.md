[/size][/size]Originally released as part of my other mod, [awg's Assorted Argonian Adjustments](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99143)﻿, but with a few new additions.[/size]

**About**
  

  
* ESPFE
[size=3]crests use Hair Color[/size]
  
* [size=3]show with most helmets (except the frill, which is treated like hair)[/size]
[size=3]no NPCs edited[/size]
  
* [size=3]no textures edited, compatible with any Argonian retexture[/size]
[size=3][size=3]built with High Poly Heads in mind, but probably works for the default Argonian heads[/size][/size]
  

  
9 new hairstyles for Argonians (both male and female)
  

  
* Parasaur (large)
Parasaur (small)
  
* Hadrosaur
Dilophosaur (3 texture variations)
  
* Dilophosaur Frill (lone and 2 dilophosaur crest combo variants)

  
I recommend using a spikeless male head for the frill if you plan on using it, otherwise the spikes will clip. There is one for High Poly Heads in my Assorted Argonian Adjustments mod and one for Vanilla heads [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80015)﻿.
  
  
Additionally, check out Argonian Creation Extension by WhiskersIsTheCat: it's an awesome mod and has a patch for these crests!

**Note:** I am not taking requests. I can assure you, I don't want to help make your idea into a mod/port a mod for you/help with your mods/make these crests usable for your human-Argonian hybrid race, so please don't contact me about that sort of thing.
  
  
Future Ideas
  
-I want to mess with some horns next: thinking nose horns and horns up farther and closer to brows and such (think Jackson's chameleon.)
  
-Chin/jaw spike options, inspired by Baldur's Gate 3's Dragonborn
  
-ESO-inspired horns
