[font=Arial][/font]****[font=Arial][/font]**[left]**[font=Arial]INTRODUCTION[/font]**[font=Arial]Ever since I first got into modding skyrim, one of my first personal goals was to make a mod to replace some of the most heinous-looking models in the game: the hairstyles.
  
  
I've tried every hair replacer out there and always ran into the same problem: there would just always be one or two hairstyles in every mod that would end up breaking immersion for me. Whether they were too glamorous, too modern or just impractical, I quickly realized that I wanted to make a hair replacer that could fit the aesthetic I was looking for. I decided to make a hair replacer that would try to stick to the original vanilla hairstyles, or at least *feel* as lore-friendly as possible with newer, high-poly model and texture replacements.[/font][font=Arial]

I was planning to replace all hairs, including orcs, but there is just not any hair replacers that currently matched the vanilla aesthetic of the orcs, and I didn't want to settle for something that felt out of place. Regarding replacing the male elder hairstyles: I have no personal issues with baldness, but I noticed that a lot of marriagable bachelors in Skyrim were missing hair, and to me this seemed like an easy solution due to a sufficient lack of male overhaul mods. If that is an issue, the Bald is Beautiful version is for you.
  
  
You may notice right off the bat that not all of these are not just KS hairstyles duplicates. In order to stick closer to vanilla styles, I've added braids (Thank you zn00p!), shortened hair lengths to avoid clipping, and edited hairlines to get a look that felt vanilla to me. I also took some liberties with some styles, especially with the female elf hairstyles. Unfortunately there weren't many hair options where I could match the styles perfectly, but I noticed that the female elf styles were generally always high ponytails or updos with similar hairlines (high widows peaks). To me this insinuated that was the current fashion of the Fourth Era, and so while the styles may not be perfect replacements, they still feel like they fit in the game.
  
  
Another thing you may notice: I have avoided heavy bangs at all costs. I quickly realized why even short blunt bangs was an issue when testing, because some NPCs facial morphs would make the eyes disappear right into the hair. Bangs are great, but in order to prevent awkward NPC blindness everyone's faces will be relatively free of fringe for max immersion, and, y'know, seeing faces!
