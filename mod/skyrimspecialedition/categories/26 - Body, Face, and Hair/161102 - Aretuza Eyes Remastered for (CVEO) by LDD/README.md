After posting[CVEO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/160705)﻿, I said I will take care of my older mod, Aretuza Eyes... 
  
  
So here I am!
  
*(I’d make the mod page prettier, but Nexus isn’t letting me.)*
  
**ADDITIONAL 179 UNIQUE EYEBALLS AND HUNDREDS OF HETEROCHROMIA COMBOS**
  
From now on, the original [Aretuza Eyes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/152682)﻿ will remain **hidden** and unavailable for download.
  
This is a **relaunch** - with much better textures and different build.
  
  
> **Aretuza Eyes Remastered is an add-on for [CVEO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/160705)﻿;**
>   
> however, I really wanted to make sure these eyes are still available for [COtR](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27405)﻿ and [UBE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92989)﻿, just like before.
>   
>   
> **This time, I took a better approach** - instead of giving you a master plugin that **forces you to download assets for VANILLA/HPH** (which you might not even use), **you can now install a dummy master that contains only the texture sets**. Then, you can add a patch for that master, which will make use of those texture sets differently depending on whether you use [COtR](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27405)﻿ or [UBE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92989)﻿.
>   
>   
> Thanks to this, there won’t be any vanilla eye meshes showing up in your eye sockets or in the sliders.
>   
> No clutter!

  
**AGAIN...
  
ARETUZA EYES REMASTERED
  
IS AN ADD-ON FOR
  
[CVEO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/160705) and no longer supports [Eyes Nouveaux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/131210)﻿﻿**
  
  
**GENERAL**
  
  
This mod no longer includes any shader maps besides the diffuses and instead relies on its main mods.
  
  
> • **In this case**, I adapted my textures to work best with the meshes and normal maps from CVEO.
>   
>   
> • **All eye textures** have been separated into left and right eyeballs, giving tons of opportunities for heterochromia (probably my favorite part!).
>   
>   
> • **You may notice** that some irises look familiar - and yes, that’s true!
>   
>   
> **Aretuza was partially used in creating the vanilla overhaul.**
>   
> So while some patterns might look familiar, the shades are different. Instead of focusing on vanilla style,
>   
> this mod focuses on offering variety - lots of it
>   
> (but stays lore-friendly).

  
**TEXTURES**
  
  
The textures have been bloomed compared to the original - they’re now less rough and much more pleasant to the eye.
  
Additionally, the irises have been made smaller so they don’t overwhelm the eyes with their size.
  
The pupil size remains medium (?) - not fully relaxed and not fully focused. Just fine.
  
  
**And the most important**, baked-in world overlay has been lowered to **50%** opacity and is no longer taking over the entire eye.
  
  
> • "Hey, there are doubled irises" - No, that’s intentional. Aretuza gives elves two different scleras each for more variety.
>   
>   
> • **In the first picture**, after the 16th eyeball, you’ll notice the beginning of a color pattern.
>   
>  > **This pattern is based** on a Procreate palette I used when creating the eye set - it contains *lots* of shades for each main color: blue, green, and brown.
>   
>  > “These colors look the same”
>   
>  > **They don’t** - color theory is just playing tricks on you.
>   
>   
> Take a look at the image below where the contrast is stronger; you’ll see the difference clearly.
>   
>   
> **This palette works great** when you’re trying to match the eyes to your hair or skin tone.
>   
> I often struggle with finding the right shade myself, but with these irises, it’s **much** easier.

> **Speaking of** **shades** - while taking the screenshots, after around **100** shots, I noticed that one of the irises in picture **3**, row **1/3**, was duplicated. It was fixed before release!
>   
>   
> **I also noticed** that the Bosmer sclera was unusually yellow for some reason, so I desaturated it(we keep the yellow for Altmers in this house).
>   
> However, the original pictures still show the older version.
>   
>   
> The irises themselves were, of course, untouched - here’s the comparison:
>   
> **Before** / **After**

Besides that, I’ve also removed the records for Orsimers, as I wasn’t happy with the old diffuses.
  
 I’d rather update the mod in the future and add new colors based on the vanilla replacer.
  
  
  
**That’s pretty much it. This mod requires either**
  
[CVEO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/160705)﻿, [COtR](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27405)﻿, or [UBE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92989)﻿ to work.
  
  
*Follow the requirements of these mods to install it correctly.*
