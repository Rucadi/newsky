**FAQ**
  
  
**Q. Why don’t you enable comments?**
  
A. I don’t see a reason to enable comments for presets or bodyslides. If you like the mod, great. If not, that’s fine too. If something doesn’t work, make sure you follow all mod instructions and read their modpages. All my presets have been tested by friends, so they should work if you have everything set up correctly.
  
  
**Q. Why are all the images low quality?**
  
A. This is due to Nexus changes. The images used to look fine, but many older ones are now low-res.
  
  
**Q. Something doesn’t work because a required mod was updated or deleted.**
  
A. I won’t update my old mods whenever a requirement changes or gets deleted. I simply don’t have the time. You’re welcome to update them yourself and publish the changes.
  
  
**Q. What clothing mods are in the screenshots?**
  
A. Most clothes are from Nexus, Rektas, Sunjeong, random Patreons, or some Asian sites. Some mods are private, but those are usually for skin and tattoos.
  
  
**Q. What ENB and ReShade do you use?**
  
A. I’ve used many, but my current ENB is a mix of [Pi-Cho](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35082) and [Silent Horizons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21543), along with some other ENB presets made by friends. ReShade settings are random, depending on what I want in the screenshots.
  
  
**Q. I really need to contact you about something. Discord? DMs?**
  
A. Sorry, I don’t use Discord anymore and I’m pretty much retired from modding. That’s part of why DMs and comments are closed. If it’s permission related, all perms are open, so you can do whatever you want, even sell my mods or claim them as your own, I really don’t care. If you want to know "what mod is in the screenshot," ask around in Discord servers.
