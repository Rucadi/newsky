This is a FOMOD containing my patches for TRX's, EvilReFlex's and OsmelMC's SOS addons to work with [The New Gentleman](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/104215) made by [ModiLogist](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/172297578).
  
This also serves as resource to others on how to make addons work with TNG, I likely won't be adding more addons to this in the foreseeable future.
  
  
What this does
  

  
1. Patches *Female* SOS Addons to work with The New Gentleman
Add-ons include pubic hair and Futanari add-ons.
  
  

Patches
  
Currently, the following patches are included:
  
1. ERF's SOS Futanari CBBE Addon
  
2. TRX's Futanari Addon
  
3. TRX'S Futanari Horse Addon
  
4. OsmelMC's 3D Pubic Hair for Females Addon.
  
  
Installation
  
0. Install the requirements.
  
1. Install the SOS addons you want the patches for. If you already have them, skip this step.
  
2. Install this mod and load it \*after\* the SOS add-ons, so mine overwrites their ESPs.
  
3. Start the game
  
4. ???
  
5. Profit.
