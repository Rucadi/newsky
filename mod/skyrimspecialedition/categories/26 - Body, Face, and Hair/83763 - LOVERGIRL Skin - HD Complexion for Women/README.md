[font=Tahoma]DESCRIPTION[/font]**
  
  
Lovergirl is a high quality 4k/2k skin texture based on Bijin Skin. 
  
This skin is very detailed, characters will have defined bone structure, pores, wrinkles and freckles. 
  
All races have unique diverse normal maps.
  
There is an ESPFE plugin that comes with the mod, this is a bugfix for some annoying vanilla issues,
  
such as wood elves not having unique textures and afflicted npcs using male textures for hands.
  
  
  
**[2K PERFORMANCE FRIENDLY VERSION HERE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/88945)﻿**
  
  
  
**[font=Tahoma]INSTALLATION[/font]**
  
  
Download and Install using a Mod Manager
  
Make sure my texture files win all conflicts by placing my mod last in your install order.
  
*Enjoy :)*[font=Tahoma]**FAQ**[/font]
  
**Why is there a plugin? Can I disable it?**
  
It's ESL flagged, so no point disabling it. It's there for a reason.
  
Female Bosmer Race is the only vanilla race that doesnt have custom textures,my esp fixes this.
  
The second fix is for Afflicted NPCs, in vanilla game the hand texture is missing, so female npcs will use the male texture,
  
which doesnt look right, my esp fixes this as well.
  
  
**Are these textures compatible with x/y/z body mod?**
  
I've provided CBBE and UNP textures, most body mods either use CBBE or UNP as a base. So it's safe to say that yes my textures are compatible with most if not all modded bodies. 
  
  
**What Body Preset are you using in the screenshots?**
  
  
It's literally the default CBBE and I use 3BA sliders to customize it in game to my liking.
  
  
**How do you get your character to look so good in the screenshots?**Racemenu, Expressive FaceGen Morphs and High Poly Head is all you need to make beautiful characters. 
  
I sculpt all of my character's faces in game. My mod's normal map textures also help to enhance detail and the bone structure of characters.
  
  
**Can we have options for hair/muscle etc?**
  
  
In the past optional files only cause issues, I have been patching my other skin mod ( Loverboy ) because of errors caused by many optional files.
  
This is why I decided to avoid many options and not use a Fomod. 
  
  
**Can I use this in an NPC replacer?**
  
  
Yeah, feel free. Just credit me and link this mod.
