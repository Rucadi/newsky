I really like his work and wanted to use it with BHUNP bodies as well and as the result of a collaboration, this mod came up.
  
  
  
**This mod includes:**
  
  
- Texture, script and source changes to make it compatible with BHUNP bodies
  
- It does not come with an .esp, it requires the original mod for that.
