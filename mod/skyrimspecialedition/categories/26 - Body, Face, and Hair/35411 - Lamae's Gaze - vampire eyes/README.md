ABOUT
  
A vampire eye replacer and standalone eye mod for human and elf races to match the eyes used in my NPC overhauls and vampire follower mods.
  
  
**Version 2.0 is a major revamp (hehe) of the original mod, and now includes the following:**
  

  
* 8 colors to choose from (red, yellow, green, blue, purple, pink, silver and the default orange)
improved textures
  
* standalone version (esl-flagged plugin, player only, does not affect NPCs - accessible through racemenu)
replacer version (no plugin, only replaces the vanilla eyes)
  
* full version (includes both the replacer and standalone install)

**Maybe, possibly, hopefully coming in a future update:**

  
* beast & orc support
patches for popular child overhauls (for clarification, they're already compatible but don't use these eyes)

INSTALLATION & REQUIREMENTS
  
This mod has no requirements but should be installed with a mod manager - manual install is not recommended. 
  
  
FAQ
  
**Q: Can this be installed/uninstalled on an existing save?**
  
A: Yes!
  
  
**Q: Can I use these even if my character isn't a vampire?**
  
A: Yes, with the full or standalone player version.
  
  
**Q: Does this work with [insert vampire/race mod here]?**
  
A: No clue, it depends on how those mods are made and what they do. I'll gladly add support for these mods if I can, but *for the love of everything unholy* - PLEASE make sure that the mod in question isn't already compatible with this one before you ask!
  
  
**Q: I installed the replacer version and vampire NPCs aren't affected.**
  
A: Unfortunately it doesn't quite work like that, it's a little more complicated. This mod will replace the vanilla eyes and every character that uses the eye textures in the default location for vampire eyes (data/textures/actors/character/eyes/) will use the new textures. Most modded NPCs will not be affected, because they have their own textures. 
  
  
**Q: Does the replacer version affect the player too?**
  
A: Yes, every character that utilises the default vampire eyes will use the eyes you choose from the replacer version. If you want your character to have different eyes than everyone else, install the full or player version. 
  
  
**Q: Can you add/change/remove something?**
  
A: Not unless there is an actual problem with my mod. This is my vision and I'm happy with it. I will*absolutely not*make any special versions for strangers on the internet. That may sound harsh, but I don't have the time to cater to everyone's individual tastes.
