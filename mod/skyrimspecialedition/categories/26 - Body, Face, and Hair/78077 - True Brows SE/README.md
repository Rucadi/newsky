This mod  is a replacer of all original female and male eyebrows to realistic eyebrows in high quality textures. It also adds standalone eyebrow options for female characters.
  
  
 Eyebrows were created from real photos. Each brow has been hand crafted and refined using Adobe Photoshop CS3 and Paint.Net
  
  
You can either use the console command 'showracemenu' to change the eyebrows of an existing character or use [ShowRaceMenu Alternative](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2155), which I recommend.

- Eyebrows are fully compatible with all mods, including mods that change faces and eyes, with the exception of mods that change  vanilla eyebrows. If you install this mod, then all other changes from other mods will simply be replaced by this one.

I highly recommend you to use Mod Organizer 2 or Vortex to install this mod.  Uninstall should be easier if you change your mind.
  
  
To manually install it, use an unpacker like 7zip or winrarand drop all files into your game DATA folder.
