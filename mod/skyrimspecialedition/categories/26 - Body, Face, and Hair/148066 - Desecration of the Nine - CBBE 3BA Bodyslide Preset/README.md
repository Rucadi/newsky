**One is time. One is rot. One creates. One forgot
  
They were not meant to know each other, but silence bread a secret lover
  
  
In the gap between two hours, when Akatosh blinked beneath star-showers
  
Namira rose, her mouth a grin, and fed him truths wrapped deep in sin
  
  
"You count the days," she whispered low. "But what of things too foul to grow?"
  
"You give the world its forward motion, I give it shame, bile and erosion"
  
  
He answered not, but let her stay. And in that pause, they both gave way
  
From seed of time and womb of filth, a thing was born of shattered myths
  
  
She did not cry. She did not laugh. She spoke in screams, her tongue in halves
  
Her skin was ash. Her blood was light. Her beauty tore through holy rites
  
  
Julianos forgot his name. Dibella wept and called it shame
  
Mara fled. Stendarr prayed. Akatosh, regretfully stayed
  
  
"She is mine," said rot and flame. "She is ours," said gods in shame
  
"She is what was never meant... The body born when rules were bent"
  
  
She is Desecration, She is the Hour
  
She is the wound in Aether's Tower**
