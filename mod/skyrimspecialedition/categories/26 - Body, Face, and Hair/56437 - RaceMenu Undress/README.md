If you're like me you sometimes need to see your character without clothes in RaceMenu for... scientific reasons. I hate having to leave RaceMenu, unequip things and then open RaceMenu again.
  
  
This mod adds an "Undress" slider which toggles the equipped items off and on.
  
  
Also if you use both SoS and another mod to start out undressed you probably noticed you're missing something. This mod does not have that issue, your friend will be there.
