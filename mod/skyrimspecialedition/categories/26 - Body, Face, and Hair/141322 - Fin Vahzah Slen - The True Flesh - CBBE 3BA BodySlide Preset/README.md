**[font=Verdana]In ages past, when moons were twin, and snow felt soft on mortal skin
  
A dragon stirred in twilight's hush. His name was forbidden, lost in a gush
  
  
With wings of ash and molten flame, he flew where no man dared to name
  
Yet not with fire did he bring dread, but with the power to shape instead
  
  
For women prayed upon the stone, in temples wrought of ice and bone
  
To feel his breath, as divine as surreal, and change their form with sculptor's zeal
  
  
A whisper here, a curve appears, a prayer, and gone are aging years
  
From elf kin grace to titan might, he gifted shapes both dark and light
  
  
No queen nor thief, no mage nor maid, could flee the art that he portrayed
  
A living shrine, their bodies blessed. Each bearing signs of the True Flesh...[/font]**
