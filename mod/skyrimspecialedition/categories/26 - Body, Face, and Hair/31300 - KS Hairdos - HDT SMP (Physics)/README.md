# KS Hairdos - HDT SMP (Physics)
- Author: ousnius - Kalilies - Stealthic
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31300


This mod comes with female hairstyles from the KS Hairdos pack with added [HDT SMP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57339) physics.
  
It is standalone and does not require the main KS Hairdos mod.
  
  

  
* The hairstyles are included as "real" hair (head parts) that can be selected in the race menu or even used for NPC mods.
Additionally, an optional file with equippable wig items is provided that lets you hand the hairstyles over to your follower.
  

  
If you're using the wigs, make sure to install [RaceMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19080) to get the correct hair color applied to them automatically.
  
You can craft them at the skyforge and they can be tempered. Alternatively, you can get them using the [AddItemMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17563) (SE + [AddItemMenu NG](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71409) for AE) or [QUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65343) (AE) mods.

2. Open the console by pressing ` and type "showracemenu" to enter the race menu where you can choose your hairstyle.

**FAQ**
  
**Q: Will this replace any hairstyles from KS Hairdos?**
  
A: No. Standalone means it's its own separate mod.
  
  
**Q: How do I change my character's hair?**
  
A: Open the console by pressing ` and type "showracemenu" to enter the race menu where you can choose your hairstyle.
  
If you installed the wigs, you need to craft them at the skyforge or insert them using the [AddItemMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17563)(SE) or [QUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65343)﻿﻿ (AE) mods.
  
  
**Q: Can you make these for men?**
  
A: No. Most of the male hair in KS Hairdos is too short.
  
  
**Q: What's the performance impact?**
  
A: HDT SMP performance depends on your CPU. Too many hairstyles (NPCs) or other types of physics at once will slow the game down.
  
  
**Q: I found something wrong with a hairstyle. Will you fix it?**A: Post the issue in the comments and we will see what we can do.
  
  
**Q: Can I use hair retexture mods with this?**
  
A: Simply replace the texture files located in "Textures\KS Hairdo's\HDT".
  
  
**Q: The wigs are all blond, how do I change their color?**
  
A: Install RaceMenu (or skee64.dll of it) to get the correct hair color applied to them automatically. Works for the player and NPCs.
  
  
**Q: On custom NPCs, why do the wigs have a different color than the NPC should have?**
  
A: A lot of NPC mods adjust the hair color directly in the facegeom .nif file. You will have to use the Creation Kit or xEdit to give the NPC the color it's supposed to have in the plugin.
  
  
**Q: Can you remove the armor rating of the wigs?**
  
A: Apply the following script to the "Armor" forms in the wigs plugin using SSEEdit:
  
Spoiler

```
unit UserScript;
  
  
  
//============================================================================
  
function Initialize: integer;
  
begin
  
end;
  
//============================================================================
  
function Process(e: IInterface): integer;
  
begin
  
  if Signature(e) <> 'ARMO' then
  
    Exit;
  
  SetElementEditValues(e, 'BOD2\Armor Type', 'Clothing');
  
  SetElementEditValues(e, 'DNAM', '0');
  
end;
  
end.
```

  
**Q: Does this work with other hair packs?**A: Yes.
