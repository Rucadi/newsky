This mod came to be because I have used Pumping Iron for a while now, and enjoy seeing somewhat more dramatic body changes to the shape of my character during a playthrough.
  
  
I haven't tried the 'exercise' addons for Pumping Iron (can't remember their name sorry), but I would say this bodyslide preset would be ideal to use with them.
  
  
Short description of weights:
  
    0 > very slim/skinny body with prominent ribcage and relatively small curves all around (runway model style)
  
  20 > slim/fit body, a bit more curves and muscles all 'round (photoshoot model style)
  
  40 > fit/blessed body, more curves than before, prominent breasts and butt (actress style)
  
  60 > blessed body, this would be the sort of curvy canon (pinup style)
  
  80 > very blessed body, more curves, muscle and fat, bigger body (actress from the 60's style)
  
100 > big body, even more curves, muscle and fat (Resident Evil Vill age style)
  
  
  
ATTENTION!
  
Apart from Racemenu, Bodyslide and CBBE 3BA, other mentioned requirements are suggested or recommended mods, meaning they are completely optional.
