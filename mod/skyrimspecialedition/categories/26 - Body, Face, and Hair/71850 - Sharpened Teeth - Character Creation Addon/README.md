# Sharpened Teeth - Character Creation Addon
- Author: HHaleyy dovahnique
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71850


A version of the textures made by HHaleyy, with sharpened teeth by me. For use in character creation for the player, separate from my "modder's resource" page with the same teeth to avoid confusion during installation. All Human races, Orcs, and Elves can use these (Not for Khajiit or Arognians). I need to make separate versions for those races and plan to do so in the future :) ESL flagged and won't take a load order spot.
  
  
Requires RaceMenu. Through testing I've found it looks best when using [Expressive Facegen Morphs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35785)﻿ to show off the teeth, even though the mouth mesh is
  
 Vanilla.
  
  
**Not compatible with custom race mods, they will not be recognized by my mod. People are welcome to make patches for this.**

Select the teeth from the "Mouth Part" slider under the "Head" section.
