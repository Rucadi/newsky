**﻿Vanilla plus presets - part 2**
  
  
These presets are a direct continuation of my previous vanilla plus preset pack that can be found [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/101978). It's a lot of presets (73 as of now), but all are organized by sex\_race\_number. This time I focus mostly on men and beast races, but I tried to match my previous pack so now every race and gender has at least 7 faces to choose from.
  
Just like my previous pack, I made these presets for [Gates to Sovngarde](https://next.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/collections/qdurkx) collection.

Feel free to change them in any way you like, you can use them out of the box or make them as a base for your hero, or your NPC mod. All for grabs, just credit me.
  
 
  
**[b][size=5]How to install:**[/b][/size]**[b]**[/b]
  
Drop the file into your Data/SKSE/Plugins/CharGen/Presets or just use mod manager.
  
If you are using Mod Organizer like I do, the path is hidden in your Overwrite at the bottom of your mod list. Click on it with right button,select open in explorer and from there you can find your preset path.
  

Warpaints are managed through makeup tab in racemenu, if you want to change the warpaint, press T while hovering above one of the lines and pick the warpaint you want
  
(you can use warpaints for any race).
  
To change color, click on the small rhombus next to the "warpaint\_name\_#".
  
You can set the hue, opacity and brightness.
  
To remove warpaint, simply set the opacity to zero.

**Additional info:**
  
I made these to feel "vanilla plus" - not to go overboard with makeup and other fantastic mods.I used smooth function in sculpt tab a lot, so let me know if a preset looks weird.
  
I made these presets to go into Jayserpa's collection Gate to Sovngarde which you can finde [here](https://next.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/collections/qdurkx).
  
  
What's with the odd numbering?
  
Like I stated above - these are direct part 2 of my previous vanilla plus presets. So if you use my [first preset pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/101978), they start at number 1. Some races and genders (looking at you, nord girls) have lot of faces in that one, so I limited them this time. If you use both mods, you'll get about 160 presets to choose from.
  
  
Can I request more faces for X race?
  
You can and I might make them when I have free time :)
  
  
I use GTS and some of them don't have the same hair!
  
Jayserpa trimmed down the SMP modular hair by Everglaid. Preset works fine, bu you'll just have to choose a different hair.
  
  

***Thank you guys and gals at Jayserpa's discord for feedback. These presets are made for you :)***
