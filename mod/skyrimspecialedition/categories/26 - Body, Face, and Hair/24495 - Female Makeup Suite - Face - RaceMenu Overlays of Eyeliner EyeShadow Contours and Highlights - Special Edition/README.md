---If you like the mod and think it deserves it, feel free to leave an endorsement as it helps me to know what people want to see more of, and I also really appreciate it! Though, adding an image of your character is even better!---

-Overview-
  
This mod aims to add more customization options for female characters, allowing them to customize their appearance in a few more ways, and to better suit the character that you want to make. Most of what is added was based on modern cosmetics, and should at least allow you to create a character with more defining features then little bits of shading. Some come in multiple parts, such as the Contours and Highlights, which are in matching sets.
  
  
In RaceMenu, to access the textures, press T over one of the default values to bring up a list of textures you have installed. Press E to change the color, and pressing T within the color selection menu will allow you access to the Glow setting (excluding makeup).
  
  
When applying the makeups to your character, black has an issue, and will likely appear as a bit washed out, making black eyeliner somewhat impossible with my current tools. However, most other colors work very well (with dark purple looking closest to black I have found). 
  
  
Playing around with opacity (transparency) sliders can make a great deal of difference when working with the different makeups, especially with the Contours and Highlights.
  
  
All overlays can be found with the prefix FMS, in the Makeup Section of RaceMenu

Current Features
  
--------
  
-RaceMenu Overlays-
  
18 Eye Liners, some for above the eyes, and others for below the eyes, some winged, and others not (more winged coming in the future once I figure them out).
  
17 Eye Shadows, to give your character increased emphasis to their eyes.
  
8 Blushes, 5 for Cheeks, 2 for the Nose, and one for the upper lip for some reason.
  
7 Lip Gloss Overlays, to give you some additional options for your characters lips.
  
5 Sets of Contours and Highlights (10 overlays), with the first 2 sets being close to modern standards, while the others may have use in unorthodox applications.
  
A collection of individual highlights.
  
  
---If you wish for these to work fully, set the iTintTextureResolution = 2048 (or 4096) in the SKSE.ini. (If you do not have this file, download the SKSE Makeup Configs from the optional files, which is preset to 2048x2048 textures.) This will allow the makeups to show in full quality!---
  
  
-Requirements-
  
Requires [RaceMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29624) (and by extension SKSE)
  
I would highly recommend using [Enhanced Female Head Mesh - Vanilla](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/94545) as it fixes some issues with your character's eyelids that are helpful for this mod. 
  
  
-Installation-
  
Extract the contents of the 7Zip and move the contents to your Skyrim Data folder, or use the Nexus Mod Manager to install.
  
You should then be able to access the Makeup through  RaceMenu, under the Makeup section.
  
If you are installing over a previous version, simply replace all when asked.
  
  
-Uninstallation-
  
Remove or disable the .esp (FMS\_FemaleMakeupSuite.esp) in your data folder and the content should no longer appear in game. To delete the textures, you should delete the folder Data\textures\actors\character\Overlays\FMS in your skyrim directory.
  
Otherwise you may just uninstall via Nexus Mod Manager if you used it to install.
