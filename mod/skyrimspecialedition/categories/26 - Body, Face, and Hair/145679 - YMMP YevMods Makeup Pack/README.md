Go to your NetImmerse Override folder in Data/SKSE/Plugins/nioverride.ini (skee.ini if you're using newer versions, thank you [MorbidBoyd](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/MorbidBoyd)﻿ for pointing out this change). Open the file in text editor of choice, find:
  

```
[Overlays/Face] ;
  
Face [Ovl#]" and "Face [SOvl#]"
  
; Determines how many face overlays there should be
  
iNumOverlays=20 ; Default[3]
  
iSpellOverlays=1 ; Default[1]
```

  
  
Change iNumOverlays to desired number. You can see I'm using 20. Higher numbers used to lag you or cap your VRAM too fast (as according to reddit). You can do it for all other overlays as well. Remember to let this one overwrite anything else, otherwise slots won't get expanded.
  
  
[line]**How does modular makeup work?**
  
For eyes, default priority will be (from the top to bottom) - Highlights, Eyeshadows, Eyeliner, low opacity Eye Lashes.
  
  
For lips - Lipstick/Lip Liner, Lip Pattern/Lip Glitter, Lip Gloss, Lip Mark.
  
  
This way everything will be visible and won't cover each other too much. Of course that's idealized and it may not be the best option for the look you're going for so keep experimenting until you find what you really like!
  
  
[line]**Can I use these textures outside of my own gameplay?**
  
Actually, yes, for the most part. I don't want them uploaded anywhere without direct link to my website (yevvie.varyel.com) or nexus mod page, and I don't want them converted to any other game without my permission. But yes, you CAN use it for followers, NPCs, just give credit where credit is due. 
  
  
  
  
**Back on Nexus?**
  
Yeah, we gotta put the website on maintenance mode until redesign is done and I'd rather avoid people just linking straight to my mega all the time. I'm also tired of constantly keeping my mega account alive, and I've been planning to post something new on nexus soon, soooo... this is here to stay?
