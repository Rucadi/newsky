As you can tell by my avatar, I am a big fan of Khajiit and nearly always play as a Khajiit character. Cats are the best, what else is there to say?
  
  
So, it is with great honor and humility that I bring you a new version of the best Khajiit skin retexture ever made, [CoverKhajiits](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/5941), now optimized for Special Edition.
  
Thank you so much to [mrLenski](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/2788925) for creating the original mod and granting me permission to release this new version
  
If you've never downloaded and endorsed that mod, I strongly encourage you to do so and support the original work that this mod was based on.
  
  
**There is now a new version of [CoverKhajiits Body Textures by Terreflare available here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76568)﻿, which was built to accompany this mod. As such, I have removed all body textures from this mod effective v1.2
  
  
This mod is included in the Nexus Collection, [Proud & Beastly Beasts](https://next.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/collections/3qkwfw)﻿. Check that out for a bunch of great beauty mods for Beast Races!**
  
  
The original textures were BC1 compression and in 2K resolution. I have cleaned them of compression artifacts and upscaled to 4K using ESRGAN/Cupscale AI software, and then converted to BC7 compression with full mipmaps. This results in increased performance and visual quality.
  
  
Personally, I recommend using this with [This One Feels Like a Tiger](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62296), which gives Khajiit a more cat-like head shape.

We know from experience that modding is an extremely addictive past-time and can be a slippery slope from creating a simple load order to porting mods to going full boat and attempting to rebuild Skyrim from the ground up. That's why we believe in a community that integrates Xbox and PC gamers along with porting noobs and experienced mod authors. We all have more to learn, and modding Skyrim to its extreme is a community effort to say the least.
