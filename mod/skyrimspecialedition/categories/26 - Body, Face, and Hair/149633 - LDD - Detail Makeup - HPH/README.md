**I was in need of overlays that would help me achieve more realistic features and details that would fit dark themed characters, so I've made my own. This mod is a version for HPH (which wasn't really planned - thank [Serket](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/serkethetyt)﻿ for reaching out to me) of my detail makeup set with support for both genders. I don't like leaving dudes behind :)**
  
**This mod is VANILLA/HPH exclusive and most likely wont work for UBE/COTR****.**
  
  
**Version for****UBE/COTR below**[Download](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/149480)﻿
  
  
This mod adds 94 high-quality racemenu overlays in the form of freckles, pores, moles, heat wave blushes, eye circles, tintable waterline (and facial hair for the dudes) to help achieve more realistic facial features and enhance your character's look.
  
  
Available in 2k/4k - screenshots were taken in 4k for the best quality.
  
  
> • I don't recommend overusing forehead heat wave blush and pores
>   
> since they were made to add gentle detail, not to be used at full opacity.

> But of course, you do you, that's just my vision while making these!
