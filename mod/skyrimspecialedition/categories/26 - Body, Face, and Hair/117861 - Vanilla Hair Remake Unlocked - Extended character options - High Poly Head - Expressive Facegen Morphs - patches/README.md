# Vanilla Hair Remake Unlocked - Extended character options - High Poly Head - Expressive Facegen Morphs - patches
- Author: Mharlek1
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/117861


**New extended character hair options** **(~340+)**
  
  
This is a race and gender hair option unlock. p.e. female dark elf to male orc.
  
A refit of and for all models for each.
  
Check the images.
  
Requires Vanilla hair remake - hdt only or static **(select your version)**
  
Install and play, nothing else to consider. Vhr requirements still needed.
  
  
You should use the patches regardless.
  
  
to note:
  
during character selection if you stumble across an hair option that looks stretched or odd, simply scroll sideways and back and your problem is solved.
  
hair is stretched and not working. you alt tabbed the game and it bugged out, it can happen. A save reload won´t suffice. Same thing can happen when switching hairs lots of times using the console command. You must choose another option and then re-enter the race menu, the previous option will then work.
  
  
To apply to npcs download the txt file in the optional files and overwrite the one from the author´s tool from the tutorial in vanilla hair remake. This file adds the new names for it. Follow Vanilla hair remake instructions in its mod page. Making new facegen is the same, only with an extra step.

unmodded vanilla hair with High Poly head with Expressive facegen Morphs
  

  
WARNING: using high poly head with high poly hair options you will still have issues for:  fem/male darkelf7, fem redguard 03, 04.
  
  
Use
  
For the player character and/or for use making npcs with both mods
  
  
For the character extended option, generate facegen normally through creation kit then run it through the mod authors tool, you also need the text file here in the misc files to be added to its folder.
  
  
**Use warning**
  
Use this mod using high poly head (if you use it, there are other patches that do not require it) for your character - this option is in the face parts slider in the character menu under the head category.
  
Does not matter if existing npcs with npc replacers have this patch or not, this patch will not change them.
  
  
For npcs to have these changes new facegen needs to be generated. And afterwards use the vanilla hair remake author tool. For custom faces you then need nifskope to swap all headparts except hair and nodes and bones into the new mesh from your racemenu creation.
  
  
**Patch progress**
  

  
* This patch is updated to v 1.03 - all races and genders and all hairs are included - likely for future versions as well.
if there other instances like the ones shown in the images use the comment section to let me know about it.
  

  
You can install/uninstall this mod at any time.
