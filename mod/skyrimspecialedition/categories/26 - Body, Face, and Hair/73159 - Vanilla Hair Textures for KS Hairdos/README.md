**This is just a texture replacer. You'll need the actual hair models from [KS Hairdos SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6817), as well as whatever replacers you want that actually give them to NPCs.**
  
  
I like the vanilla hair textures, so I took the vanilla hair textures and made a made a custom map that I can easily apply to hair mod textures.
  
  
Will be releasing more as I make them - typically in order of when I decide to use them on an NPC in my game. If there's a specific hair you want, let me know and I'll be sure to have it included whenever I next do an update. Currently covers ~460 KS hairstyles.
  
  
A version is also available for [KS Hairdos Lite](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1932) - this version is complete and covers all the hairs available in Lite.﻿

Some hairs will look better than others, but I'm overall pleased with the results. Let me know if any styles have major issues.
  
  
(Some of the screenshots may not be of hairs from KS Hairdos, it's hard to keep track - I just took some screenshots in-game of some I've made so far. If they're from a different hair mod, they'll be released in their respective pack... eventually. I'm starting with KS since it's by far the bulk of what I've made so far.)
