This is the CBBE adaptation of the signature [Milfactory D\*sney Mommy preset originally on BHUNP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77629)Faithful to the original design, nearly identical in term of proportion, shape, size and officially supported by Milfactory,
  
Now 3BA user can enjoy Milfactory mods to their fullest satisfaction.
  
  
There are two reasons for me to make this preset:
  
1. I got enormous amount of request to make a preset similar to D\*sney Mommy for 3BA
  
2. I can't help but feel that 3BA users of my mods are left hanging because all of my works are based on my BHUNP preset.
  
This hopefully will provide them a good alternative. So here it is. Enjoy. 
  
  
  
> ﻿Inspired by.... several certain characters from several certain media production, D\*sney Mommy preset features a tastefully thicc body with gentle curvature while still managed to look relatively convincing.
>   
>   
> This preset is intended to use with [Obody NG](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77016) so no "outfit" preset is provided.

Q: Who is the model in the screenshots?
  
A: [Valariel The Auntmer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/82866)Q: Can I use this on normal CBBE?
  
A: sort of, some sliders are not there, but the overall shape should be similar.
  
  
Q: BHUNP version?
  
A: [D-sney Mommy NG - BHUNP Bodyslide Preset](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77629)Q: what version is better? 3BA or BHUNP?
  
A: They both have same aesthetic and proportion, in fact damn near identical when it come to size, even nipple position match up.
  
Howver due to topology and sliders differences, BHUNP will have smoother waist-ass-hip transition and tighter ass.
  
while 3BA will have slightly softer boobs. ﻿

* Install all the requirements files and their prerequisites
Install the preset using your mod manager of choice
  

﻿
  
  
﻿Note on 3BA installation:
  
  

  
* Choose the collision breast size as medium.
The bouncing physic is up to your taste, but I recommend least or slightly bounce because it's a curvy body.
  
* You should add gravity effect, you can do it without gravity, but the preset is designed with gravity in mind.
Don't use the auto push up function, I highly recommend using [Obody NG](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77016) refit function instead.
