This is simply a standalone version of the fabulous [Multi Colored KS Hairdos SE by Mekasaa](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8840). 
  
  
This adds the multicolored hairs as new hairs instead of replacing the textures of the original KS Hairdos.
  
  
Currently available are female-only (no physics), female-only (physics), and male-only.
  
  
Alternate colors (monochrome, ombre, etc.) will be released at some point in the future.
  
  
Each can be installed alone or with the others if you only want a specific set.

* [KS Hairdo's](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6817)﻿ (duh)
