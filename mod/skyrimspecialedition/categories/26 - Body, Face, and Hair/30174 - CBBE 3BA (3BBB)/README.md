First of all, thanks to [Ousnius](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/4291759), the original author of [CBBE SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/198), for giving me his permission to edit his mod.
  
  
  
  
My screenshots are just an example using sliders of this body
  
You can get my body preset [here](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/20338-acros-mousebell-body-preset-for-cbbe-3ba/)
  
  
  
  
  
**Description**
  
  
This is an improved version of [CBBE SMP (3BBB)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29023)
  
  
**CBBE 3BA** stands for **CBBE 3BBB Advanced (or called Amazing Body)**
  
  
This will provide Jiggly hdt sexier movements, natural bone weights spread, CPU friendly optimized options, etc
  
  
Then what's the difference from CBBE SMP then? These are essential features of the mod below
  
  
[font=Georgia]**1. Implanted 3BBB bone weights to the body, and also repainted the bone weights and more spread out so that it will perform much more smoother, sexier bouncing**
  
  
**2. CBPC is now also available with the body. You don't have to rely on SMP only, which means it will solve high CPU usage caused by smp for low-spec users. Moreover, you can always swap SMP and CBPC even during the gameplay**
  
  
**3. Various physics presets depending on your taste and the size of breasts will be provided**[/font]
  
  
**[font=Georgia]4. Body meshes improvements and additional sliders you'll like[/font]**
  
  
  
  
  
  
**So how is it different?**
  
  
**1. more vertices**
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/hdV1fHp.jpg)
  
  
More vertices in breasts that you see often
  
So when making various shape about breasts, possible to express a smooth curve without being angled
  
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/K30kghM.png)
  
*this outfit is Vindictus Golden Bastet Xing*
  
Like this breasts, this can give you a better experience 
  
  
  
  
**2. Improved edge flow**
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/2zhtpeR.jpg)
  
  
Improved overall edge flow of body meshes
  
This improvement have a smoother curve even though has same vertices count
  
  
  
  
**3. Detailed genitals**
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/3BO6ArS.jpg)
  
  
Along with 3D Labia mesh, anus mesh exists too
  
  
  
  
4. More sliders
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/KXefr1f.png)
  
  
Supports additional 60 sliders more than CBBE SE
  
These additional sliders make easier to build the body you dream of
  
  
  
  
**5. Improved bounce**
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/1VByiMw.gif)﻿
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/BoFdp86.gif)
  
  
Bones that making breasts movement has increased to 3
  
so this will make breasts bounce and collision to more natural
  
  
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/QR72h79.gif)
  
And supports various physics for breasts, butt, belly, legs
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
**[b]SMP and CBPC?**[/b]
  
  
It's a kind of physics
  
Both CBPC and SMP can show various bounce and have collisions
  
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/E9YlwX3.gif)
  
In CBPC, to make a exact collision
  
That needs to customize collision setting according to your body
  
  
But if you don't watch carefully, it's okayThe collision files provided in this mod will be sufficient
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/diCn1nP.gif)﻿﻿
  
In SMP, to make a exact collision   
  
That needs to build collision meshes in bodyslide
  
  
  
  
Bounce feature is almost same
  
You just have to choose bounce you want
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/AV7ymAo.gif)
  
(CBPC Very softness preset)
  
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/P5CfVZM.gif)
  
(SMP Option1 Dcup preset)
  
  
  
  
  
  
Also CBPC has more friendly to performance more then SMP
  
such as processing of only NPC that comes into camera angle and ragdoll based physics
  
This can provide you with more FPS
  
  
  
  
and has additional features for body physics in CBPC
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/uFCAHum.gif)﻿
  
Even if usually breasts don't saggingIt can make breasts sag more when a specific posture for realistic
  
  
And CBPC has auto push up feature that raises breasts sagging when wearing armor
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/gbdOWVI.gif)
  
 
  
  
  
Also can set strength of bounce depending on weight of NPCs and Player
  
So you can setting is possible like next

```
﻿  0 weight NPCs and Player = small bounce
  
0.5 weight NPCs and Player = middle bounce
  
  1 weight NPCs and Player = big bounce
```

These additional features can provide you with a more natural look
  
  
  
  
So this mod can be work only SMP for body part where collision is important like Breasts and can be work CBPC for the rest
  
  
**Yeah, this mod provides mixed physics so you can maximize the advantages of two physics**
  
**That feature is another advantage of this mod**
  
  
  
 
  
  
  
  
**You can choice body physics with CBPC and SMP**
  
  
  
you can choice variety of physics options to mix and use

How to use SMP physics within a game?
  
  
Select and build *"CBBE 3BBB Amazing SMP Object - Player or NPC ABCDcup"* in the Body Slide.
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/g2vgTss.png)
  
Why is it divided into Player and NPC?
  
Because the player and npc to have a different body preset.
  
  
  
The **cups** means is breast physics strength.**Dcup** shakes the most.**Acup** shakes the smallest.
  
  
  
The **Player** uses the selected Breasts physics strength when installing this mod.
  
  
And see this video.
  
  
[font=Georgia]\*\* [/font][font=Georgia]The version 1.22 or higher, the Toggle Hotkeys can be used instead of the spell.[/font]
  
[font=Georgia]     You can also activate it at any time in the MCM if you want the spell way. \*\*
  
[/font]
  
**Hotkey list :**
  
Player : Num+
  
NPCs : Num9
  
  
You can disable hotkeys from the MCM or change it to other key.If you want to disable the hotkey, Enter ESC or DELETE to the hotkey.
  
This change the Hotkey to DELETE, but it is actually disable.
  
And you can activate the previously used Spell method in the MCM.
  
  
*\*\* Spell, toggle key are not one for each one person, more folks can use it together. \*\**
  
  
  
Therefore we can to balance feature and performance.
  
And you can give SMP physics strength for NPCs as you want.
