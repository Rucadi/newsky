Update 26.07.2017 - I've given editing rights to Shiva182, author of the UNPB SE port. She will be using her talents to help maintain the mod, as regrettably I've never had the time again to care for the mod (nor play Skyrim at all...). Thank you so much for volunteering/stepping up, Shiva.

Total Character Makeover - Install TCM first, then UNP. This mod **have** to overwrite all female body and face textures. Other textures are optional.
  
  
**WICO (Windsong Character Overhaul)** - Only compatible with UNP version of WICO. Whatever you install will overwrite WICO's bsa.
  
  
Skin Texture mods (Mature Skin, Fair Skin, etc) - Totally compatible but they will overwrite the mod's skin textures. Make sure it's for UNP.

[font=Georgia]FAQ[/font]
  
  
Q: Why does my game CTDs when I get naked or loot female NPC?
  
A: You have installed TBBP meshes without having all the requirements. Install XPMSSE with either fake physics or physics extension rigmap.
  
  
Q: Is it safe to install/uninstall in the middle of a play through?
  
A: Of course it is!
  
  
Q: Why doesn't this mod show up in my plugins list?
  
A: This mod is only a meshes and textures replacer, which means no plugin (You'll get a plugin if you install SG Eyebrows, since it adds new brows)
  
  
Q: How do I know that this mod is installed?
  
A: Check that you have the meshes and textures
  
Meshes path = DriveYouInstalledSteam:\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition\Data\Meshes\actors\character\character assets
  
Texture path = DriveYouInstalledSteam:\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition\Data\textures\actors\character\female.
  
Steam and your mod manager should be installed on the same drive.
  
  
Q: Why does some of my NPCs have black faces?
  
A: It has nothing to do with this mod. This mod can't cause black faces. You have two mods that edits the same NPCs and facegen doesn't corresponds to the right esp, meaning you have to change your loadorder. Remember that loose files wins over bsa archives.  
  
  
Q: Why does High Elf's eyebrows sink into the face?
  
A: If this happens then you still have the .TRI files from ECE, delete them.
  
  
Q: How can I change something on this body?
  
A: You need to install the program [Bodyslide](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/201/?) and install [Legacy UUNP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43773) or [BHUNP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31126)
