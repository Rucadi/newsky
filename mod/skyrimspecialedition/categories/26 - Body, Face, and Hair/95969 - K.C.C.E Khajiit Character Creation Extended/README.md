**﻿KCCE - Khajiit Character Creation Extended,** is an addon for RaceMenu that adds a bunch of new sliders for Khajiit characters.
  
I made this mainly for my upcoming Sphynx Khajiit mod, as I noticed while working on it that there really weren't a lot of character creation options for khajiit. In addition most of the distinctiveness came from fur colour/pattern rather than shape, something that wouldn't really work for a Sphynx as they don't, you know, have fur for the most part. With that said, I saw an opportunity to expand on the character creation options players have for khajiit in general with this mod.
  
  
Please let me know if you have any issues with the mod, be they bugs you've found or if you think a slider could be improved. I'm also willing to take suggestions on possible new sliders to add in, so if you have any ideas let me know.
  
  
**Features:**
  

  
* Around 40 new sliders in total (give or take)
Sliders for ears that also move earrings and ear tufts
  
* Sliders to adjust the placement of earrings
Whisker customisation
  
* Full compatibility with High Poly Head

  
**Compatibility:**Mods that modify or replace the vanilla chargen tri files, OR modify vanilla kahjiit hair will be incompatible.(depending on the changes it might be fine, but if you're having issues let me know and I'll see what I can do about making a patch.) Other than those two things, there shouldn't be any compatibly issues. 
  
  
as of v1.1, A patch for [BeastHHBB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38480) has been added to the Miscellaneous files tab, this patch makes the rings and ear tufts respond to the sliders. Unfortunately was having trouble patching the facial hair, and considering that many of the sliders (mainly the beards) wouldn't be effected too noticeably anyway, I have have chosen not to spend the time patching them. You will still be fine to use the facial hairs, they just might look a little weird with some slider combos, applologies.
  
  
24/07/2023: Patch for [Khajiit Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48223) has been added, 2 sliders have been removed from this version as they do not translate well to the new head shape. Please ONLY use the Khajiit Overhaul version of the mod if you are using Khajiit Overhaul and do not install any of the main files. The BeastHHBB patch is fine to use with this version.
