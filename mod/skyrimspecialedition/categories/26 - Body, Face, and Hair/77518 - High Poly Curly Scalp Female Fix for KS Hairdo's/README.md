This is simply a mesh replacement for the curly scalp human mesh from KS Hairdo's utilizing a mesh from high poly head. For shaved female haircuts this will make the shaved part look smoother and have less clipping in cases where the character is not simply looking straight ahead. This really only impacts a few haircuts since the scalp is generally not showing on most KS Hairdo's. 
  
  
This will impact primarily character creation and when generating facegen for characters that happen to use the haircuts that use this scalp mesh. Untested whether it will improve the scalp for existing NPCs with facegen using the old mesh, but I'd assume it won't. I mainly created this for personal use as I like using the haircuts that happen to use this scalp and it'll make for nicer looking high poly NPCs. 
  
  
Examples of differences in media. It is more subtle of a difference with lighter hair colors.
