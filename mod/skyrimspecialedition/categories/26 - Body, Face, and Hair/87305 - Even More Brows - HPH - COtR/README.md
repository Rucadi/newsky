**LE version:**
  
  
[Even More Brows - HPH - COtR (LE)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/115084)
  
  
  
**This is not a replacer!**
  
  
  
I've been working on this mod for a long time, adjusting colors and maps. Finally, I've decided to make the normal map empty, so it doesn't make the eyebrows reflect too much light. 
  
This mod is completely unisex, you can use it both for male and female characters.
  
In my opinion, COtR needs more attention so I included a version compatible with it. 
  
It is compatible with High Poly Head or COtR only, so it probably won't work with vanilla head mesh. 
  
You can use both HPH and COtR versions at the same time.
  
In the image section you can see the full showcase of the light variant.
  
  
  
**What's inside?**
  

  
* 41 eyebrow variants both for male and female characters
41 darker versions of those variants
