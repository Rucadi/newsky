**Description**:
  
The usual Pubic Hairs available on "Lovers Lab" and "Nexus" are just textures (tattoos) or 3D models that can't detect and apply the NPCs Hair Colors. Thanks to the *NiOverride*that come with the *RaceMenu*, this mod allow you equip a Pubic Hair that will take the same color as the NPC or Player Head Hair. 
  
 
  
The Mod come in 3 parts, one for Females, other for Male actors and another for Futanari actors:
  

  
* The Futa Addon come with the following Pubic Hairs for the [TRX - Futanari Addon](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/19039-trx-futanari-addon-wip/)﻿:[list]
Landing Strip
  
* Bush,
Wild
  
* Untamed
*Paw (for the next version)*
  

  
[\*]The Female Addon come with the following Pubic Hairs:

  
* Landing Strip
Bush,
  
* Wild
Untamed
  
* Net Trim
Hart
  
* Sparse Bush
Bushy
  
* Very Bushy
Very Small Strip
  
* Strip
*Paw (on the BETA version)*
  
* *Natural Wild (on the BETA version)*
Shaved (without hair, for compatibility reasons)
  

  
[\*]The Male Addon come with the following Pubic Hair for the "Smurf Average, VectorPlexus Muscular, VectorPlexus Regular and Leito" Schlongs:

  
* Natural Wild
*Landing Strip (for the next version)*
  
* *Bush (for the next version)*
*Wild (for the next version)*
  
* *Untamed (for the next version)*
*Paw (for the next version)*
  

  
[/list]
  
  
**Installation**:
  

  
* To install it, just open the compressed files with your mod manager o extract the compressed files into your Skyrim data folder and build the BodySlide meshes of the female pubic hairs that come apart.*By the way the "SOS Pubic Hair for Females COCO (BodySlide)" should be compatible with all the body types with the belly node.*
In case of pregnancy belly edit the body sliders on the RaceMenu or some other mod that use the related to the Morphs, make sure keep the "Build Morphs" option on the BodySlide while you are building the pubic hair meshes.
  
* The Male Mod is independent from the Female Mod but both come with the same script files; so is harmless let one overwrite the other.
For compatibility reasons the Male addons require it's not pubic versions installed. (Is just to make sure that the Schlongs meshes are present because this mod only add the Hair meshes in order to keep compatibility with your current Body Physics)
  
* In the case of the Futa Addon, make sure of "Build" just the hairless version of the original TRX Addon and the independent hairs of my BodySlide. Otherwise you will end with 2 different hairs on the same futa.

  
**Update**:
  
 ﻿The update process usually is just about replace or overwrite the previous files but in some cases will be different:
  

  
* The BETA version on the Updates comes ESL flagged so probably will require the use of option to Reset the SOS Addons on the SOS MCM.
In case of update from a ESP unflagged plugin to a ESL or ESP plugin flagged as ESL, the FormID's will drastically change so a Clean Save will be required together with the use of option to Reset the SOS Addons on the SOS MCM. 
  
* All my Pubic Hair Addons share the same base scripts but those scrips can be enhanced between version so in case of be using more than one of my Addons is always recommended place lower the Addon with the most recent version number. That way the newest scripts can overwrite the oldest.

  
**Compatibility**:
  
Incompatible with "The New Gentleman" because the colors here are done 100% by scripts and those scripts are made for SOS so any TNG patch will have to rewrite all the scripts and that will be another Mod.
  
Is not compatible with other Pubic Hair Meshes or BodySlide's because the meshes need a special treatment to accept the actor hair color.
  
Is 100% compatible with COCO body and all the other Body Physics. Since use you current version of the hairless Addon for the Male Schlongs.
  
Is for Skyrim SE but can be compatible with LE with just convert the included meshes or using one of my old BodySlide's for LE.
  
 
  
\* For LE compatibility or my tweaked SOS, can check [my Tweaks on LoversLab](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/10316-osmelmc-mod-tweaks/).
  
 
  
**Recommendations**:
  
SOS - Schlongs of Skyrim with PapyrusUtil & SexLab (Tweak) from [my Tweaks on LoversLab](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/10316-osmelmc-mod-tweaks/).
