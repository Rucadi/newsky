- Author: karamazovnew
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16399
**Requires:**
  
- [Bijin Warmaidens SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1825/?tab=description)- [Bijin Wives SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11247)- [Bijin NPCs SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11287?)- Any AIO esp from the above OR:
  
- [Bijin All in One-SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11)﻿  (but you have to manually rename his esp from "Bijin\_AIO 2018.esp" to "Bijin AIO. esp").
  
  
Includes bundled Serana and Valerica mods in misc section.
  
  
Main files (use one or the other)
  

  
* AIO - YBMT (For Original AIO) requires "Bijin AIO SE for USSEP" or "Bijin AIO SE" optional files of the original [Bijin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11287?tab=files)﻿ mod.
AIO - YBMT (For Bijin AIO SSE 2018) requires Mebantiza's [Bijin All in One -SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11?tab=files)﻿ mod. 
  

  
Note: As of today 29/07/2018, the mod had to be split into 2 versions. If you were already using the original AIO, no change is required. If you were using Mebantiza's 2018 mod, then please download the second version and let it overwrite the previous version of my mod. Please read below for more details
  
Note: 07/08/2018, I've moved the previous version to the Old Files section. The new one uses the "Bijin\_AIO 2018.esp" file of Mebantiza's mod directly as a master, no need to rename his file anymore. Otherwise they're both similar. 
  
  
**Introduction**I love Bodyslide, and I love Bijin mods, but I could never get my textures to work well with the characters. This is because [rxkx22](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/2650523)'s Bijin mods use they own custom meshes and textures. Attempts have been made to include bodyslide meshes for the characters, but my mod uses an even simpler method: it reroutes all body meshes/textures and head textures to their "vanilla" location.
  
  
All you have to do is to provide a good texture pack and body mesh of your choice through Bodyslide (CBBE or even UUNP). If they look good on you character (and, by extension, on any vanilla NPC), now they'll look the same on your Bijin NPCs as well. 
  
  
Details such as head meshes, hairs, eyes and freckles have been kept so the characters retain most of their detail. Some of the original variety is lost, but you will longer get ugly seams due to either a difference in diffuse textures, or specular and normal textures, or any combination of these, also you don't have to reinstall the mods to switch from CBBE to UUNP (or reverse).
  
  
**In detail**In case you're wondering exactly what this mod does and what it includes:
  
- facegendata meshes from [rxkx22](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/2650523)'s original Bijin Warmaidens/NPC's/Wives mods, with all main head textures re-linked to the vanilla location. 
  
- modified ESP files with the following differences from the originals:
  

  
* Armor Addon: all meshes have been relinked to use the torso, feet and hands meshes found in the "actors\character\character assets\" folder
Texture Set: all torso and hands textures have been relinked to the textures found in the "actors\character\female\" folder
  
* the esp files only alter what is needed, so it is future-compatible even without bashing with any AIO (all in one) mod.

  
**Result**No pics, no clicks, so notice a complete lack of neck and hands seams on the attached picture. Sorry for the bad quality, I am using VR. The texture I'm using is a custom mashup of Demoniac textures, although any set should work. I've tested it with CBBE, UUNP for the meshes and SG, Mature, Fairskin and Demoniac for the textures.
  
  
**[size=5]How to Install**
  
[/size]**Option 1: All In One (all three Bijin mods)**
  
  
1. Download and install all the following mods (click for links):
  
- [Bijin Warmaidens SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1825/?tab=description)- [Bijin Wives SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11247)- [Bijin NPCs SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11287?)
  
[color=#ffffff]During install only select the ALL-IN-ONE options, go with no wrinkles (they will be ignored anyway by my mod) and choose any body, although I suggest you use CBBE if you plan to use CBBE bodysliders and UUNP if you plan to use UUNP ones. Not that I've noticed any difference, since I was later able to switch back and forth from CBBE meshes/textures to UUNP meshes/textures without problems.[/color]
  
  
2A. From his optional files, get one of his AIO versions, either the "BIJIN AIO - SE" or "BIJIN AIO - SE for USSEP"
  
  
**[color=#ff7700]No need to download High Res textures. My mod will reroute these texture to use your existing body textures.**
  
  
Disable the individual esp files and just keep the AIO one.
  
  
Download and install my "AIO - YBMT (For Original AIO)" main file, using NMM or MO.[/color]
  
2B. OR, In case you want to use Mebantiza's [Bijin All in One - SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11?tab=files) mod instead (I do), download "AIO - YBMT (For Bijin AIO SSE 2018)" from my main files and install it as usual. 
  
Note: the "needs rename" version has been moved to the Old Files section. They're identical, but the old one uses "Bijin AIO.esp" name as a master. For upgrading an existing savegame, use the old one, for a new game, use the Main one. 
  
  
  
3. [color=#ffffff]Your load order should look like this:
  
  
- any other mod that alters these NPCs
  
[/color][color=#ffffff][color=#ea9999]~~- Bijin Warmaidens.esp (DISABLE or delete)
  
- Bijin Wives.esp (DISABLE or delete)
  
- Bijin NPCs.esp (DISABLE or delete)~~
  
- Bijin AIO.esp    (original non USSEP, original USSEP) 
  
OR
  
- Binin\_AIO 2018.esp (Mebantiza's mod)
  
- Bijin AIO - YBMT. esp (this mod)
  
  
[/color][/color]
  
**! No need** to install [Bijin All-in-one Customizer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14000) ﻿Kudos to the mod's author, but all it does is provide extra texture options (which my mod completely ignores).
  
  
**! No need** to install [Bijin Bodyslides](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16097) mod. That mod only alters the original Bijin body mesh files which my mod now completely ignores. You might still want it for the extra companions that it contains.
  
  
If you already have them installed, no critical need to uninstall them, it's just that they will not have any effect as long as you use my mod.
  
  
  
**If you're a usual Bodyslide user, you're ready to go. The game should instantly pick up your body meshes and textures. If not...** 
  
  
  
4. Install Bodyslide, if you don't have it already**.** If you don't know what Bodyslide is, then you shouldn't be using my mod. I assume you also have CBBE body and armors (or UUNP) and know how to use it to alter bodies and armor with the batch function. 
  
  
5. Get a proper texture mod for your character. Or just use the CBBE originals. Or even move Bijin's original textures and use them for your own body.  I'm using Demoniac's awesome pack, which comes with SG textures, subsurface scattering disabler and all types of skin shine. You can find it here (don't worry, it works nicely in SE, there's also a UUNP version): ﻿<https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/70834/>﻿.
  
If you're using CBBE, then why not try my own version of Demoniac? ﻿[Demoniac VR Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18743)﻿. 
  
  
You can also use other texture packs, just make sure they look ok on your other female characters (non-Bijin) before you blame any seams or misplaced nipples on my mod. Same goes for armor.
  
  
**IMPORTANT: Remake all of your bodies and armors with Bodyslide the first time, or whenever you alter your body texture pack.** The armors need to update their textures in order to work. But you should already know that if you're using Bodyslide.
  
**[b]Option 2: Individual Bijin Mods (optionals section)**[/b]**[b]**[/b]Important! The original individual mods don't include USSEP modifications. Use them at your own risk. My mod doesn't fix that because it doesn't touch any NPC stats.
  
  
Same in option 1, but download only those Bijin mods you want, then install my corresponding optional file.

(notice no AIO esps).[/color][/color][/color]**[u][b][size=5]How to Uninstall**[/size]
  
[/b][/u][size=3]Safe to Uninstall at any time[/size]**Serana and Valerica**I assume you're familiar with rxkx22's mod, kindly ported to SE by bchick3 and elrizzo: **[Seranaholic](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13027?tab=description)**Since bchick3 was kind enough to allow me to redistribute it here, you'll find both Serana and Valerica listed in the misc files. They are straight copies of their original Seranaholic SSE 1.8.2 and Valerica SSE 1.7.2, with my edits to the mesh and texture links. This means that they also inherit all issues of their originals, including not being able to alter Serana's weight. 
  
  
**Changelog**1.3 (and again): Uploaded a new version for SSE AIO that uses that mod's naming of "Bijin\_AIO 2018.esp" as master, moved the old one to Old Files, in case you still need it. They're identical otherwise. 
  
1.3 (again): Form ID fixes to match latest patch of Bijin All In One-SSE. Unfortunately, it's not possible to support it with the same file, so it's now a separate download. 
  
MISC - added Serana and Valerica as Misc files.
  
1.3 - Updated all esps to Form Version 44 (Serana and Valerica were already ok)
  
1.2  - Adrianne Purple Hair fix
  
1.1 - Compatibility Update -  Original esps ARE NOW REQUIRED
  
1.0 - Initial Release - original esps are not required
  
  
**Credits and permissions**Rxkx22 unfortunately retired from modding, but all kudos goes to his amazing original mods. This mod still needs his, and thus inherits all of his permissions and restrictions.
  
This mod also redistribuites Seranaholic by rxkx22, bchick3 and elrizzo and as such inherits all of their original permissions and restrictions.
