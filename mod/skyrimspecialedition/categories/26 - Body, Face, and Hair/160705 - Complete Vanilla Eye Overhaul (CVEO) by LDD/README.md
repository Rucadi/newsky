> **Albino** / **Regular** / **Black** / **Tintable**
>   
> lashes are available as a main slider and as separated lash for left and right eye in the HAIR tab.
>   
>   
>  > **Tintable** lashes follow your hair color, allowing for bold and vibrant styles or simply matching your lashes to your hair.
>   
> > **Regular** lashes have a natural brown tint, making them a subtle and versatile choice that works well for everyone.
>   
>  > **Black** lashes are ideal for a sharp, defined look.
>   
>  > **Albino** lashes are, unsurprisingly, albino.
>   
>   
> **IMPORTANT!**
>   
> My mod pushes the vanilla lash meshes to their absolute limits, greatly enhancing the character creation experience,
>   
> but it is still an extremely low-poly vanilla mesh, so keep that in mind.
>   
>   
> **Mashuping lashes in-game is posibble!**
>   
>   
> Layering lashes is experimental and will be improved in future updates.
>   
> Currently, applying one mesh on top of another may (not necessarily will) cause flickering or conflicts in display priority.
>   
> In dark colors, this effect is usually barely noticeable.

> **Lash** customization is available only for women, because **it seems men were never really meant to have** **lashes**, **considering their mesh**. I recommend using the vanilla **lash** length slider at a value of 1.5–2 **when creating a masculine character**, and it will look fine.
>   
>   
> > **Other** than that, all **lash** textures and eye part sliders are available for men as well, so no worries!
>   
>   
> Beta sliders were created while I was experimenting with **lashes**.
>   
> ...and thinking, “Damn, I wish I could do that with the mesh.” 
>   
>   
> > **Sometimes** they make sense, sometimes not - play with them and see for yourself.
>   
>   
> **Lashes** are not pre-defined! Shape them however you want and adapt your mesh to the textures you pick.
>   
> Go bushy, slim, fox-eye, dramatic - it’s entirely your choice.
>   
>   
> > **These** **lashes** love to be sculpted by you, so don’t be afraid.
>   
> Entire mod was made with **improvment**, **customization** and **freedom** in mind.
>   
>   
> **IMPORTANT!** Sliders are technically unlimited, as they sometimes work well above the 100% (1.0) value.
>   
> Be aware, though, that they were originally designed for the 1.0 range, and extreme values may cause distortions. Combining 20 sliders on a vanilla lash mesh that has like three faces for its entire surface is not as well recommended. Just use them wisely, and you’ll be very happy with the results.
>   
>   
> **Known issues:**• If you'll make lashes too long (very long) and it will happen that they overlap, for example, bangs in your hairstyle, you will see under certain angle lash and it's "border". It's simply alpha glitching. Either lower the length of your lashes, change hairstyle or just ignore it.

> **When** using custom **heterochromia**, **make sure** your eye slider is set to eyes that use the same color for both eyeballs. **If this is ignored**, two eye meshes will be applied in the exact same spot, which may cause **flickering** or constant **swapping**, as the eyes fight for visibility.

> This adds more awesome textures integrated with my overhaul.
>   
> **To** make it work, you need to **download the standalone version of the mod** linked above, **delete the plugin and meshes from its folder**, and then **install my plugin**. This will add eyes in the same way as **Khisartin's** original plugin, since it was built on top of it to ensure **accuracy**.

> **If the eye mod you want to patch is a replacer - it won’t work.**
>   
> I added new records, new texture sets, and generally edited the way vanilla eyes function.
>   
> You will bork my entire work and cause errors.
>   
> **If the eye mod you want to patch is a standalone - you can do that:**
>   
> **1.** Make CVEO a master of your eye mod.
>   
> **2.** Point all eyes in your plugin to the meshes in CVEO.
>   
> **3.** If texture sets of your eyes in your plugin are not pointing to the blank **\_sk** map, correct that.
>   
>   
> **Optional**You can add your eyes into my custom heterochromia slider.
>   
> **1.** Copy all eye records for **MALE** and **FEMALE** twice in your plugin:
>   
> **>** point your first partition of eye records to the **LEFT** EYEBALL meshes in my mod,
>   
> **>** point your second partition of eye records to the **RIGHT** EYEBALL meshes in my mod.
>   
> **2.** In the records of your newly created eyeballs, change the category:
>   
> **>** for all **LEFT** EYEBALLS from EYES - to **184**,
>   
> **>** for all **RIGHT** EYEBALLS from EYES - to **185**.
>   
> Those numbers refer to my custom sliders; that way they will show up. 
>   
> Otherwise, you will create a mess in your general eye slider and your character will end up with only one eyeball XD

>   
> **-= TIP =-**
>   
> **If you have unpatched eyes installed and still want to use them:**
>   
> 1. Take off my lashes by setting up lash slider to **0**,
>   
> 2. Take of my carancula and AO by setting up miscellaneous slider to **0**.
>   
> **Now you should be able to use those eyes without any issues.
>   
> You can still use my customization sliders on unpatched eyes :)**

> Results may be different, I made them for my eyes - not vanilla ones
