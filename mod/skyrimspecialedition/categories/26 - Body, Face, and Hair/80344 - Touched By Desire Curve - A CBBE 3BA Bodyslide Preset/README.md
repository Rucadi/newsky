[font=Georgia]A body preset made for CBBE 3BA, that is atletic, with abs and large thights, but also a voluptuous breast and thin waist. Weight 0 and 100 are the same however there is 2 bodyslide preset, one called "TBD Curve" that leave the breast fall, and the other called  "TBD Curve - Outfit" with a breast pushed up. I recommend to use a mod like Unique Character or OBody if you want this preset to be apply only on your character and not all npc, but you need to know how those mods works before doing anything !
