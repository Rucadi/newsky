**﻿Most artifacts are blades, tomes or enchanted, but this ones walks...
  
  
Known in hushed circles as The Daedric Loadstone, the form is flesh shaped by forgotten forces, neither mortal nor safe.
  
Curves wrapped in magnetism, hips turned into laws of obsession. The glutes sway with pull, like moons dragged by gravity.
  
No mind remains still in her presence. No will stays intact for long
  
  
 She first appeared at the collapse of an Ayleid pleasure cult, striding barefoot through marble walls as if the world had been build beneath her.****Their altars shattered. Their gods forgotten. All eyes fell backward, and then downward
  
  
When scholars at the Arcane University attempted to measure her, eight mages were dismissed for "conduct unbecoming of academia".
  
Scrolls recorded unusual mana surges around her hips, including minor telekinetic effects, reality warping and spontaneous arousal.
  
  
She was later sent to Thalmor for containment...
  
They did not contain her...
  
  
After witnessing her picking up something from the floor, a Justiciar collapsed, screaming, and the entire testing wing was quarantined.
  
The incident report described her as a:
  
  
"Class-9 Forbidden Mass (Non-Destructive Type"
  
with a stern addendum:
  
"Gravitational enchantments possible. Subject not to be viewed from the rear"**
