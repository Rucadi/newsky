**EYE NORMAL MAP FIX SSE
  
  
There is now a version for True Eyes 2.0 in both the main and optional categories.
  
The main True Eyes file is the standard DXT5 compression. The optional file is the DX11 BC7 compression for those who think it makes a difference.
  
Only use one file. Use either the main or optional True Eyes version if you are using True Eyes 2.0.
  
The True Eyes versions are independent of the original main and optional files. They contain both human and beast normal maps now.**
  
This port of my original mod is different than the one for original Skyrim. If you are using the original Skyrim uncompressed version for SSE, please use this one instead. Bethesda has caused some instability issues in their latest engine involving ARGB8x32 uncompressed textures, which can cause CTDs. This happened with their first update to Fallout 4 and has carried over to SSE. This version guarantees those instability issues will not happen.
  
  
DESCRIPTION:
  
This mod alters the human and beast race normal maps to reflect light correctly. It is just a pair of textures and will not impact performance, or conflict with anything else, like modified character creation.
  
It is compatible with pretty much every eye mod out there, and has been based on the majority of the eye textures in Eyes of Beauty, since that is the most popular.
  
  
Some of the eye mods out have included my original version ( which they were not supposed to ) , or a modified variant, but those too have been left uncompressed. They need to be replaced with this version, or removed completely.
  
  
The main file is saved in the standard DXT5ARGB format, and works just fine. Due to being twice the size of the vanilla file of the same compression, the artifacts from being compressed don't show.
  
There is a BC7 file in the Optional section for those wanting it. Visually, there is no difference between the two in game.
  
  
This fix can also be applied to any custom follower by simply replacing the same texture in its respective standalone folder.
  
It works on humans, elves, orcs, beasts and any custom race or follower who uses the vanilla eye maps.
  
  
NOTE: Due to the vast number of custom eye texture mods, and there not being a specific template for iris placement, this may not line up perfectly with all custom eyes. please do not contact me asking me to make alternate normal maps for specific custom eyes.

My really choppy video. I found a patrolling guard at night so it enhances the effect.
