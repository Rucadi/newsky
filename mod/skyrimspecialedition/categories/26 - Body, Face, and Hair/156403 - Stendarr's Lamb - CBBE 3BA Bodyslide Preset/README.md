**﻿"Beneath the righteous gaze of Stendarr, there is no mercy for the wicked... but sometimes, mercy takes the shape of temptation".****In the silent halls beneath the Hall of the Vigilant, a hidden rite is whispered among the oldest of the Order. A forbidden ritual, uttered only when the tides of evil swell too great for steel or fire alone.
  
  
Once every generation, or when the previous soul passes away, a single woman is chosen, blessed, altered, sanctified through the Benediction of the Lamb.
  
Her body becomes the lure, her presence a siren's call to the vile. Demons, vampires, daedra, and worse are drawn to her like maggots to sacred flesh.
  
  
This "Lamb" is sent into the world as radiant bait. Her exaggerated, nurturing form awakens something primal, a twisting desire into recklessness. The corrupted step into the light, seduced by the illusion of vulnerability. And when they do she calls upon the wrath of Stendarr
  
  
Some Vigilants view her as a blasphemy. Others as their last hope. But the cunning enemies of man know to thread carefully around her.
  
  
"Let them come, their hunger shall be their end".**
