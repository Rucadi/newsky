**Update (2/24/2021):** Threw together a small video of the body with its physics in motion **[[b]here](https://youtu.be/vv5_aZ8tS3E)**﻿. (Must be signed in on a 18+ Youtube account to view)
  
  
Alternatively, [/b]I have a MEGA Link **[here](https://mega.nz/folder/TfxnhQRC#U-ZIK0hHXyzUrPABo_LzNA)** for anyone that would like an easy time making the game look like my screenshots on a base install of SSE.

**What is it:** A simple bodyslide preset made for the CBBE 3BBB body type. 0% weight is more realistic t h i c c, 100% weight is like a T H I C C Mom from PIXAR.
  
  
ALL with jiggle/SMP HDT Physics. All Images use 100% weight.
  
  
The Preset is called ***Thottie to Mommy***.
