**Aquatic Elegance - Argonian Koi Whisker Addons**

  
  
There are 4 different types of whiskers per gender to pick from the ***scars*** section of racemenu. Currently no tri-files but they shouldn't cause much clipping unless your nose shape is very small or creative. I will try to figure out how to make them. This is my first attempt at seriously diving into creation kit, outfitstudio, nifskope and blender and it took me weeks to make this. They are compatible with every skin out of the box, by using the body textures!
  
> * ***Update (03.10.23):** Reduced excessive shininess. I am currently putting the SPID project on hold. Since permissions are open, anyone can do it, if they want to. Cheers.*

  
**There is two versions available to pick from:**

  
* Non-HDT (static)
With HDT-SMP Physics

* In the **scars** selection of the argonians - there is 4 selections per gender. Use Slot 46. **!NEW CHANGE!**

**Any requirements?**

  
* [Faster HDT-SMP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57339)﻿ (optional, only if you pick the HDT version)

**Known Bugs?**

  
* [size=3]No .tri files means they **dont morph with the face when editing your character** (currently trying to figure that out, too)[/size]
[size=3]The HDT-version will not work correctly with [Dread Tentacles](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39112)﻿ because they use the same bones.[/size]
