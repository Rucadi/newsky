**Each time I'm making a male character, I find it hard to make a decision on which hair would fit him the best. Unfortunately, neither of them do. Hairstyles never fit the head, add that weird and ugly (I'm sorry) black scalp texture... and the shapes. Well-**
  
  
I decided to re-model the hairstyles and fix them as much as possible. Some of the hairstyles **will remain** a bit levitating next to the forehead, neck, and ears. I have also created a new scalp using the Redguard’s bald hairstyle, which will be applied to every hairstyle with shaved sides or similar features. I reshaped it to better fit my vision as well.
  
  
**Quick reminder**
  
**These hairstyles were never meant to be used in Skyrim; they're ported. Most of them are from The Sims 4. They refuse to cooperate, regardless of how much I try.**
  
**Technical stuff**
  
• Forehead issues: most of the hairstyles come with uneven roots. Also, textures matter **A LOT** because they determine the direction in which the hair strands go. I can't snap them all the way to the forehead because they pull the rest of the hair with them, which causes horrible clipping. Also, I needed to chill because it deforms **A LOT** as well.
  
  
• Neck issues: since the head and neck constantly move, **it's impossible** to snap them directly to the body, and I had to fix most of them after the first versions. When your character looks left or right, the hair would clip with the neck, so the gap between the two **is crucial**.
  
  
• Ear issues: **I've tried my best** to fix the hair clipping with the ear issue, and I did, but it results in a bit of stretched textures by the ears – for me, not a problem. I honestly don't even notice them unless I zoom in, but it's there. Please keep in mind that I've styled the hair to fit regular-shaped ears, meaning it may not fit "elf" or spiky ears.
  
  
• I have shaped the hair using my character because the core High Poly Head is wider than what we get in-game. I've also tested the hairstyles on **John Skyrim**, and they look fine. If you experience any clipping, try deflating your head in those areas - but that shouldn't happen.
  
  
~~**Future plans**
  
**Not all hairstyles are covered; I'm doing it mostly for myself and simply sharing with you guys as I know how much trouble that hair pack is and how literally nobody cares about males. So far, there are 16 hairstyles available.**
  
• I will cover most of the hairstyles that come with the pack (something around 107), but while doing so, I guarantee that I will blacklist some of them and not touch them at all. Honestly, as I go through them, I often ask myself, "what am I supposed to do with that" xD
  
  
• There will be new hairstyles constantly released, but in a "pack" way. I follow alphabetical order, meaning all the hairstyles whose names start with the letter A will be released, then B, then C... I will be simply updating the main files with more hairstyles, so just keep the track on the mod.
  
  
**So far A-B are done.**
  
• Elves are not supported for now because they have to be re-fitted to a different head, as theirs is smaller. I doubt I will ever do them, though – too much work, and I don't play these races.~~**MOD WILL NOT BE CONTINUED. PAY ATTENTION TO THE PINNED POST.**![](https://i.imgur.com/OPLXWuK.png)

• My mod runs on its own separate plugin because I simply can't work on someone else's, so both versions are available at the same time.
  
• It requires KS Hairdos SSE, as it uses its resources and will not work without it.
  
• It's compatible with any textures made for KS Hairdos SSE.

Just drop it into your mod manager, but make sure it loads after its requirements!
