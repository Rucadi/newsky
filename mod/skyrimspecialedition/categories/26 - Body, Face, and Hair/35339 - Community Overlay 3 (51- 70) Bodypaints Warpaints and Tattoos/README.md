-Overview-
  
 ﻿This mod was a project of mine to give something back to the community that has supported me so much, by not making what I wanted to make, but making what YOU, members of the community, wanted to see in an overlay! Some of the people I decided to work with were not very big, but they all have big hearts and a passion for modding and screen-archery! Many of them contributed images to the mod, as I was not allowed to take any pictures for this mod, so be sure to check out their profiles and support them if you like their work!
  
  
Whats included?
  
 20 Sets of unique overlays, each designed according to the parameters given to me by different community members! Some cover more than one part of the body, and may come in multiple layers! There are also some extra goodies I left in for the fun of it! You may also check out all the gorgeous screenshots taken by members of the community who helped me to get this mod ready, I highly recommend you check out their work and give them a ton of support, I have their profiles linked below!
  
  
 ﻿
  
 ﻿ ﻿ There are Bodypaints, Tattoos, Ritual Markings,  Beautiful Designs, Runic markings, and so much more in this mod! It is quite literally a grab bag, and each individual overlay had a lot of time and effort put into it, until the person they were inspired by was satisfied!
  
  
 ﻿Also, this mod supports CBBE, UNP, and Male bodies, so just about anyone should be able to use it. The ability to use both Female and Male overlays in the same file is present in this version as well, so you should have to switch your files if you wish to use both Female and Male characters with the Overlays!
  
  
Whats planned for the future?
  
 The mod is essentially 100% complete! I may attempt to patch out any bugs that may pop up, but you can rest assured that this is the best quality I can manage to bring you! If you have any ideas for anything feel free to stop by my Discord linked below to check on the progress of this or any of my future mods! Keep in touch and I may include some ideas of your own for a future installment!

-Mod Usage-
  
*[color=#f4cccc]-NOTE - You can access racemenu at any time by using the "showracemenu" command in the console by pressing the Tilde ~ key-*[/color]
  
 ﻿In order to use the  mod, you will need [RaceMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/29624/) installed, which allows you much more options for character customization. Inside of RaceMenu, shortly after the normal character customization options, you will find the Makeup, Body Paint, Hand Paint, and Foot Paint sections, with a list of textures inside. To select a texture to add to your character, press "T" over one of the values that show up, which will bring up a large list of all the overlays you have available to you.
  
 ﻿ At the bottom there should be a search bar, which you can type into to specify what you are looking for. To help the user to find the overlays that will best fit the character they are using, all overlays added by the mod come with the prefix CO, and followed by the number the overlay corresponds to.
  
 ﻿Thus, typing into the search bar in the texture lists "CO 51", will pull up the Nexregiant bodypaint!
  
-Installation-
  
 ﻿Installation is simple, simple extract the files and move the data folder inside to your Skyrim directory. Otherwise, you may use Vortex or NMM to install by choosing download with Vortex/NMM in the files section.
  
-Uninstallation-
  
 ﻿If you installed using Vortex NMM, or any other mod organizer, you will likely be able to uninstall using it.
  
 ﻿To uninstall the mod for RaceMenu, you may disable the mods esp, as well as delete the bsa.

-Setting up SKSE for HD Tintmasks-
  
Navigate to your SKSE directory in data, and create/open the SKSE.ini file (you can save as "All file types" and add the .ini after).
  
  
Inside, you should add/find [Display]
  
underneath this, you should add
  
iTintTextureResolution=2048 (or whatever size textures you are looking to use.)
  
  
Here is an example of the contents of SKSE.ini file with the texture resolution set to 2048x2048
  
  
[General]
  
EnableDiagnostics=0
  
ClearInvalidRegistrations=1
  
[Display]
  
iTintTextureResolution=2048
  
[Memory]
  
defaultHeapInitialAllocMB=768
  
scrapHeapSizeMB=256
  
  
Otherwise, if you wish to, you can use a premade config from the miscellaneous files of this mod.
