Some additional words:
  
  
Everytime I start to create a new BodySlide preset from zeroed sliders, the result is mostly in some way similiar to my Tinraa Body. That was a reason for me the start at my already existing bodies to see where it goes.

A few notes to the edits:
  
A-C Screens: Is mostly The A-C Preset, but with the changes from my Screens2 preset just to have another 'normal' one besides my Soft preset.
  
B-D Leg Day: The upper body is a bit smaller, especially on max weight, bigger tights, a bit more hourglas shapped.
  
C-E CuSeRo: Inspired by the work of an artist who draws women very curvy and strong, this preset was mostly overworked on max weight. [size=4][size=3]Bigger butt, more hourglas shaped, changes on the back. This should be the only one that needs 3BAv2.
  
[/size]SoftER: Mostly like the Soft preset, but now it's like the max weight would be 200, and it got 2 push up variations.
  
Strong refined: Uplifted the Body a bit and set some slider to 0 so it can be used on normal CBBE aswell.
  
  
  
Even if those are only a Bodyslide presets, I'd like to fill my credits with some of those mods that made my screenshots look the way they are but are not a requirement.
