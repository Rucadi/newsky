Inspired by.... several certain characters from several certain media production, D\*sney Mommy preset features a tastefully thicc body with gentle curvature while still managed to look relatively convincing. Over the last several months, it has been used by members of the Ostim community, appeared in many OpenSex demo animation and finally getting updated for Nexus release.
  
  
This preset has been used by my friend [aceanimations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/130801683) exclusively during OpenSex development and likely will still be in the future, so out of the box it has perfect alignment with OpenSex animations.
  
  
This preset is intended to use with [Obody NG](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77016) so no "outfit" preset is provided. All you need is to enable "outfit refit" function from Obody NG.
  
This preset does not use body type morph (7base, Unpb, Unpo etc....) to avoid unnecessary deformity and minimize potential clipping.

* Install all the requirements files and their prerequisites
Install the preset using your mod manager of choice
  

  
Note on CBPC installation:
  
  

  
* Chose the correct version of Skyrim and Skyrim / Skse version
Set all "Bounce amplitude" at "normal"
  
* Enable "Gravity" config
The reset doesn't matter
  

Note on BHUNP installation:
  
  

  
* Highly recommended to use HDT-SMP body with the option: CBPC + SMP (most parts B) - Only breasts are running on SMP
Boobs Physics - Rare bounce
  
* Boobs collision: "Small~big boobs" or "Medium boobs" both works
Boobs gravity: add gravity
  
* Gravity is there: Gravity for boobs
Boobs push-up: **Dont add auto push-up**
  
* If you need to adjust your body physics, you can download the BHUNP Physics config installer and let it overwrite BHUNP instead of reinstalling the whole package
