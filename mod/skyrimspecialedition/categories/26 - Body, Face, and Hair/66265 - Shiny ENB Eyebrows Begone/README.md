**[EDIT: I wasn't aware of an LE fix for this already, so check it out! <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/49168/?>]**
  
  
This mod is just a texture replacer that replaces the eyebrow normal maps for both males and females (works on npcs as well) It gets rid of the shiny brow problem with certain ENBs that have really high specular values or if you just have shiny eyebrows in general
  
  
  
Install with your mod manager like normal and let it overwrite any eyebrow mods!
  
  
Compatible with all eyebrow texture mods, but was made with [Hvergelmir's Brows](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1062) normal maps
