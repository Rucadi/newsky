[font=Arial]**KEY FEATURES**[/font][font=Arial]
  
  

  
* **Natural Colors**: Teeth are now a light yellow/grey tone, mimicking the appearance of healthy teeth instead of glowing white.
**Improved Mouth Shadows**: Darkened edges and inner textures of the mouth to remove any glowing effects.

* Tested using **Rudy ENB** and my personal mod list. It should work well with other ENBs, too—feel free to share your screenshots!
If you'd like me to enhance additional teeth mods, leave your suggestions in the comments!
