Since Racemenu is out for SSE and seems to work perfectly for me and many others I wondered, why there are not really any mods for war paints. So I decided to try and port BH Warpaints from Oldrim for myself. Because the port seemed to work without an issue I contacted the original uploader to get permission for an official upload.
  
  
So here we are: Thanks to permission by [Diethardt](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/5373679)﻿ I give you:
