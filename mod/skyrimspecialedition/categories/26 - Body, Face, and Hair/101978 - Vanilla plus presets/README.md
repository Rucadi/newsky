**Preset for every playable race.**

When Jayserpa started his GTS collection ([here](https://next.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/collections/qdurkx?_gl=1*19rpqgj*_ga*MTM3NTI1NDE2MC4xNjg4NDY0NzAy*_ga_N0TELNQ37M*MTY5NjYxMTQ1MS4zOTguMS4xNjk2NjExNjA5LjAuMC4w)) I wanted to make vanilla preset replacer for him. Could not get it to work, so I started to make a batch of racemenu presets. Now (after small BG3 detour, hehe) it is done and ready for all. It's a lot of presets (30 male and 58 female), but all are organized by sex\_race\_number. **Update:** Added presets without ECE requirement in optional files, these are meant for GTS collection. Some faces will look a bit different, mainly elven women, but they are close enough.
  
[size=3]**Update 2:** Made 16 presets for beast races, 4 for each race/sex. Argonians turned out really nice, khajiits not so much,
  
but they are there too.
  
**Update 3:** Almost complete re-work of the mod, tweaked presets to suit my current style more and added new hairs. Removed ECE slider requirement. Now contains one single file for all 88 presets. Fixed entries in the makeup tab, so now it's just vanilla makeup textures.

Feel free to change them in any way you like, you can use them out of the box or make them as a base for your hero, or your NPC mod. All for grabs, just credit me. 
  
  
**[b][size=5]How to install**[/b][/size]**[b]**[/b]
  
Drop the file into your Data/SKSE/Plugins/CharGen/Presets or just use mod manager.
  
  
If you are using Mod Organizer like I do, the path is hidden in your Overwrite at the bottom of your mod list. Click on it with right button, select open in explorer and from there you can find your preset path.[size=5]

Warpaints are managed through makeup tab in racemenu, if you want to change the
  
warpaint, press T while hovering above one of the lines and pick the
  
warpaint you want
  
(you can use warpaints for any race).
  
To change color, click on the small rhombus next to the "warpaint\_name\_#".
  
You can set the hue, opacity and brightness.
  
To remove warpaint, simply set the opacity to zero.

[/size]**Additional info**
  
I made these to feel "vanilla plus" - not to go overboard with makeup and other fantastic mods. I did use slider mods and smooth function in sculpt, so let me know if a preset looks weird. 
  
  
Why are there way more female presets than male?
  
Because I already had tons of those - many of these were either a preset for my character, preset I already released (in HPH version) or faces I used for my NPC replacer (older work, now hidden).  All of male faces were created from scratch by someone who never plays male characters.
  
  
What about beast races?
  
~~Maybe later..~~ Done!
  
  
I want more presets!
