-Overview-
  
 ﻿This mod is a continuation of the Vanilla Warpaints Absolution mod, which replaced all of the warpaints for every race and gender, this mod is to complete my collection of high-quality vanilla tintmasks, to increase the quality of the vanilla colors/makeups for not only males/females, but also for the beast races. This mod includes tintmasks for them as well!
  
  
Whats included?
  
 ﻿All vanilla makeups/colors (as well as dirts) redone by hand and in up to 4K quality, each having a unique style and matching closely to the vanilla, though I did make a few small adjustments where I felt it improved the quality. This mod can replace tintmasks for Males, Females, Argonians, and Khajiit characters, you can choose to install them all, or install each individually according to your liking. 
  
  
Whats planned for the future?
  
 ﻿I want to redo some of the beast race ones when I get the chance, otherwise you can let me know in the posts what you think could be done to improve some of these!

-Requirements-
  
[SKSE](https://skse.silverlock.org/) - This is required to use tintmasks of much higher quality than what is allowed in vanilla.
  
  
-Installation-
  
 ﻿Installation is simple, simply extract the files find the version you wish to use, then move its contents to your data directory. Otherwise, you may use Vortex or NMM to install by choosing download with Vortex/NMM in the files section.
  
-Uninstallation-
  
 ﻿If you installed using Vortex NMM, or any other mod organizer, you will likely be able to uninstall using it.
  
 ﻿Otherwise you will need to remove or replace the files added in your tintmasks folder in your character assets.
  
  
-Setting up SKSE for HD Tintmasks-
  
Navigate to your SKSE directory in data, and create/open the SKSE.ini file (you can save as "All file types" and add the .ini after).
  
(This is atleast required if you are using SKSE, and want the paints to appear at full resolution)
  
  
Inside, you should add/find [Display]
  
underneath this, you should add
  
iTintTextureResolution=2048 (or whatever size textures you are looking to use.)
  
  
Here is an example of the contents of SKSE.ini file with the texture resolution set to 2048x2048
  
  
[General]
  
EnableDiagnostics=0
  
ClearInvalidRegistrations=1
  
[Display]
  
iTintTextureResolution=2048
  
[Memory]
  
defaultHeapInitialAllocMB=768
  
scrapHeapSizeMB=256
  
  
Otherwise, if you wish to, you can use a premade config from the miscellaneous files of this mod.
