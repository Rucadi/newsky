**In an age when mortals learned to guard their sleep, warding off nightmares with faith, willpower, and spell craft, Vaermina, Mistress of Dreams, grew ravenous. Her Dreamstride, an ever-shifting realm of dream and nightmare, hungered for more than fear, willing souls, drawn in by desire rather than dread.****She turned to an old and quiet ally: Nocturnal, Lady of Shadows and Secrets, sovereign of the Evergloam.****“Give me a body they cannot resist,” Vaermina whispered. “A form no mortall can ignore, no god can banish, and no dreamer can forget.”****From shadow and forgotten yearning, Nocturnal confided in her a lost, cursed form.****As such, a shape was born, illusion made solid, a trap cast in curves.****The result was Vaermina’s Hunger, a being of soft horror and sublime design, her breasts impossibly full, impossibly perfect, glistening as though always kissed by moonlight.**

  

**To touch her breasts is to be marked by Vaermina herself.No pain. No warning. Only a strange warmth, and then, the sleeper is claimed.The next time they fall asleep, whether by magic, fatigue, or drunken stupor…They never wake up.Their soul is ripped from the body, drawn into Quagmire, where time fractures and identity fades away.
  
  
Vaermina feeds on their dreams, twisting them into fuel for her power; and the Hunger is sent to hunt again...
