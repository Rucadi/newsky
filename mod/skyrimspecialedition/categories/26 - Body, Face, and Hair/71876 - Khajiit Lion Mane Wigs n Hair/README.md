**Description**
  
Ever wanted to play as a full-on Male Lion-Khajiit but were bummed out there were no hair mods that added Lion Manes? Me too, and so I threw this together. I'll admit that it's not the best made or prettiest hair mod out there, but I feel like it's good enough to suit its purpose. 
  
  
As of current, the mod is available in 2 versions, both ESP-FE, one as a constructible and temper-able selection of wigs (or can be obtained by using [AddItemMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17563)﻿ or a similar mod) - or as an alternate version that includes the Manes as playable hair, selectable in Racemenu. Now as of version 2.0 RM issue was fixed thanks to the help of [magicbunnyrabbit](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/11580058) , as well as of version 2.1 new featured EARRING and EAR TUFT options! I am not exceptionally skilled with hair mods, but with the lack of options out there for a Lion Mane, I gave it my best effort anyway. 
  
  
These Hairs/Wigs do conform to the hair color selection you've made in RM and should use whatever base hair textures you have installed for HairLong.dds/HairLong\_n.dds.
  
  
The assets used are mashups from [BEASTHHBB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38480) which uses assets from [Khajiit Hair](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/67873) ,  BEASTHHBB has listed open permissions on their page as long as credit is given, and the author of Khajiit Hair - [Saerileth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/4522213) has left a sticky in the comments for open permissions since their retirement from modding. Given that the assets were free to use to begin with, I am stating here that anyone who desires to improve upon or make bug fixes to this mod are free to do so as long as they credit my work and the original asset authors [Mharlek1](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/20108844) & [Saerileth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/4522213) .

All that being said, I hope you all enjoy this mod and can beam proudly with your new luxiourious manes.
  
  
**NOTE:** Beard portions in screenshots are from [Beards of Power](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42635) and ARE NOT included with my mod but are highly recommended since my mod only provides the head hairs/wigs﻿ and no facial hair.
