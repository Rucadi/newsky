**My good friend FableForge, (Creator of the AMAZING mod****[There Is No Umbra: Chapter 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47302)) asked if I would be willing to overhaul the appearance of the infamous Naenra Waerr.
  
  
Having already owed my soul to Fable for all of his coding help, I decided I would be more then happy to make a banger of an overhaul. :P**For those of you who have seen this trailer, I am the creator of the body that Daumbra is wearing :P you can watch it here! 
  
  
**Fable's only conditions for Naenra were to make her a dolled up Barbie looking for a damn good time, and I was more than happy to oblige. Characters/Followers are my specialty, and I wanted to give that fiesty little spitfire a much needed upgrade.

Naenra looks fucking insane with my 3BA/3BBB bodyslide preset that has 7.6k downloads.

Last but most certainly not least, I created a revolutionary mod that Unequips your Weapons when you use furniture, and re-equips them when you stand up. FableForge himself helped immensely with the proof of concept! You can find it here!
