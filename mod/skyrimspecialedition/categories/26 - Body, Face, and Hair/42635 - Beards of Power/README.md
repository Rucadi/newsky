# Beards of Power
- Author: Mharlek1
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42635


**Please read the 0.4 changelog**
  
This mod adds beards and mustache options to humans, elves and orcs; also comes with considerable Khajiit support - version 0.4 has 200+ options
  
  
This mod affects only the player character.
  
This mod is also an open resource for anyone wanting to use it for npc mods/any mod. 
  
Since version 0.4 onwards, the beards can be applied directly to npcs without any need of complicated adjustments, now anyone can do it.
  
----------------------------------------
  
The beards only work with the game default sliders
  
To note:
  
Beard accessories are more susceptible to slider values. Consider moving the sliders to put the accessories back into the correct place.
  
Orcs are also more susceptible to this. You can  check in the creation kit and make these adjustments. Usually by receding the mouth forward or chin forward sliders to the value of 0 or below.
  
  
  
Fun mustaches:
  
The new 0.4 mustaches allow for extra creativity - you can create new mustache shapes simply by moving the nose up/down, mouth up down, wider, etc.
  
Look at this silly example Spoiler

Requirements: Choose a version
  
  
Conflicts - Since 0.4 **overwrite** expressive facegen morphs and/or expressive facial animation - male ; this will make sure to include my newest vanilla beard edits and fixes.
  
  
Clipping - clipping is the same as vanilla, while crouching, neck twisting, etc. Some longer beards may look stiff because they are modeled to armor and clothing and not the naked body, so the chin area has a curved angle to them to avoiding clippings.
  
  
Flagged as an esl.

- feel free to combine your own beards in the CK by configuring them together as parts or main parts.
  
  
  
Color mismatch between hair and facial hair
  
For Khajiit there is no redemption but I included some options nonetheless
  
Use a retex mod like salt and wind and vhr for the models p.e. mix them with a hair color mod like natural hair colors or mild colors
  
Use a beard retex such as Khisartin  [facial hair](https://www.ddsworkshop.net/facialhair/) from ddsworkshop, its what I use.
