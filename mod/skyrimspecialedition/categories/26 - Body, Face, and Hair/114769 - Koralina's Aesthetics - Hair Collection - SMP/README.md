Major update - WIGS
  
  

  
* Can be installed together with hair
Can be given to followers
  
* (probably) more lightweight than hair

  
  
Information:
  
  

  
* This mod adds 3 hairstyles and/or 3 wigs: Wendy, Bae and WolfCut
Hairstyles are made to support SMP - thus [Faster HDT-SMP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57339)﻿ is **required**
  
* The hairstyles have **no mipmaps** - the textures are 4k and remain 4k even after you zoom out
This mod is made to be **FPS-friendly** - physics is minimal and natural
  
* This is my first SMP mod - if you encounter any problems or anomalies, first visit the troubleshooting section, then report a bug or write a comment. Pls be nice ?

  
  
  
**Installation:**
  
  
Use Vortex or MO2
  
  
  
  
**Troubleshooting:**
  
  

  
* If the hair clips through the body:

 ﻿- Open the mod
  
 ﻿- Go to the folder of the clipping hairstyle
  
 ﻿- Find an XML file and open it with Notepad++ or another software
  
 ﻿- Scroll until you find <per-triangle-shape name="CK\_CollisionFemaleMiddle">
  
 ﻿- Increase the margin to 1 (or lower)
  
 ﻿- Check in game, if it's weird then go back and try another value
  
 ﻿- Alternatively, open OutfitStudio, import the CollisionBody mesh, inflate it where you want, export to NIF to the same place as the original file (overwrite it)
  
 ﻿*If you decide to increase the margins or inflate a collision mesh, the hair will keep further from the body*
  

  
* If physics anomalies happen

 ﻿- Make sure you have  [Faster HDT-SMP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57339)﻿ installed correctly
  
 ﻿- Report a bug
