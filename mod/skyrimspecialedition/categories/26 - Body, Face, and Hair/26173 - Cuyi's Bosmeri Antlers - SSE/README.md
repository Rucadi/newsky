The original mod by cuyima can be found [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/97325).
  
  
Adds five variations of antlers for your character to use.
  
They can either be selected during character creation as a scar or can be worn as a circlet after obtaining them using [AddItemMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17563).
  
  
The antlers are based on the ones from Nightshade's TDN Equipable Horns but the base mesh as well as the idea have been taken from Bosmeri Antlers by Dreldyn. In version 1.1 the antlers come with custom HD textures made by the fantastic [Khisartin/Letho0036](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/45836952)﻿!
  
  
The antlers are pretty close to the head so there will be clipping with hairstyles that have a lot of volume. Also they can technically be baked into NPC head meshes in case you want to use them for an NPC overhaul.
