* [font=Tahoma]This body preset is made for[CBBE 3BA (3BBB)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30174), you can also use it for regular[CBBE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/2666) but keep it in mind thatthere will be a missing slider in regular CBBE therefore the body will not look as good as CBBE 3BA (3BBB) [/font]
[font=Tahoma]Use [BodySlide & Outfit Studio](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/201) to build the body preset to CBBE 3BA SMP Object , Bodies , Hands , Feet & Outfit that you want﻿ to use for the character , remember that sexy skimpy outfit is recommended if you use this preset[/font]
  
* [font=Tahoma]There are 2 different body preset files (Nude) & (Outfit) they are the same shape and proportion but offer special purpose the (Nude) is preset for your character naked body , feet & hand this also intended for topless , bikini , skimpy & slutty outfit , the (Outfit) is preset for your entire outfit build that you want for the character to use unlike the (Nude) that will make the boobies move freely depending on how gravity take her the (Outfit) will give a push up effect on the chest area make the boobies tight and firm this also toned down the nipple a bit and make it soft suitable for lingerie , sport bra , light clothing , light armor especially something that doesn't look heavy or bulky[/font]
[font=Tahoma]This body utilized 0 - 100 body weight , you can play with it and adjust your own character body weight this also work for any female NPC & Follower that use your female character asset body but you can also build this preset for your follower if they have their own body[/font]
  
* [font=Tahoma]Best if you use this preset with smooth normal map to make the body appear more soft[/font]
[font=Tahoma]For those who curious with my CBBE 3BA physic settings because a lot of you asking me that question and i apologize if i can't answer that one by one because so many people ask me that question but i will tell you that for now i'm still using the old version of [CBBE 3BA (3BBB)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30174) V2.0.6 & [CBPC - Physics with Collisions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21224) V1.3.6 , because for me that version give the best and natural bouncing for the overall body that i don't even need to edit anything , old is gold right ? :)[/font]﻿
