[font=Verdana]*[font=Trebuchet MS]Introduction:
  
  
High Poly Head, was another mod that took the community by storm, but there was just one problem for me. I wasn't really feeling the expressions, and some of the gimmicks I was used to pulling off on screenshots with vanilla head, were just not possible with High Poly. People kept recommending me Expressive Female Animation, but for me it had the same problem of its design not really being what I needed. So I ended up taking a look at the head tri files myself, and decided to rebuild expressions to something I actually liked.[/font][font=Trebuchet MS]

[font=Trebuchet MS]**WHAT IT DOES:** **Re-sculpting of facial expressions that works both on Vanilla and High Poly Head.**
  
 Needs mfg console or a similar mod (like Opparco on SE) to work.
  
Among the main differences with other mods, I've made expressions a bit more "intense" and it's possible to make more exaggerated expressions such as a full teeth smiling grin, I've made Aah and Big Aah to be more open, same with Oh, I've made a more marked Happy dialogue/mood and so on. Big and little differences.
  
The expressions were originally intended for HPH, but I've crafted the same edits on a vanilla head tri file, so it has files for both.

**REQUIREMENT:** [**High Poly Head**](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V_jcYzwTiKnSv8Dbv-7Z0hh9SWbkn6Bi)
  
  
[/font][font=Trebuchet MS]**COMPATIBILITY**:[/font][font=Trebuchet MS] **Expressive Female Animation, is NOT compatible, since this does the exact same function, but differently.** CHOOSE ONE OR THE OTHER
  
*FAQ:*[/font]

  
* [font=Trebuchet MS]*"Why not use EFA instead?" A: No real reason other than personal choice.*[/font]

  
* [font=Trebuchet MS]*"Is EFA and EFM Compatible?"* A: [Expressive Facegen Morphs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/102796) by the same author as EFA, is completely compatible and very recommended, as it produces even better results when combined with this. (Basically, both my mod and EFA control expressions, EFM controls *chargen sliders* instead). EFA, I repeat, IS NOT COMPATIBLE SINCE IT CONTAINS THE SAME FILES AND IT WILL CONFLICT. You must choose one or the other.[/font]
[font=Trebuchet MS]*"X mod says it requires EFA"* A: I would try to explain more, but it's pointless. Any mod that says it "requires EFA" should work just as well with this. Technically, those mods actually just require High Poly Head, since EFA is just a simpler option to get the required files.[/font]
  

[font=Trebuchet MS]**Install:**
  
[/font]

  
* [font=Trebuchet MS]Standard file pack. (Use a mod manager or unpack files to your mod directory).[/font]
[font=Trebuchet MS]HPH already comes with some expression options on its installer, but the EFA option there is irrelevant, so choose whatever. [/font]
  
* [font=Trebuchet MS]This mod needs to overwrite expression files (tri) to install properly. Make sure the files from this mod win any file conflict you might have in your modlist.[/font]

**Using on Followers and other NPCs:**
  
If a follower is using their own tri files, they are usually located somewhere on the follower's file tree, something like Meshes/Actors/CustomFollower/Head or something similar, *it depends on the author's design*. But once located (And it should be easy, because head tri is usually named "FemaleHead.tri" or something very recognizable) it's a matter of knowing whether it's vanilla or high poly head, and you can overwrite those tris with custom ones, like IE, the ones that come with this mod.
  
  
ANOTHER POSSIBILITY, is that the author didn't natively customize head meshes for the character, or that it's just a vanilla Skyrim NPC you want to see this on. Those, end up using the base directories for either Vanilla or High Poly heads, in which case, this mod is already acting on them.
  
  

**[size=5]Mod use permissions:**

  
It's tri files, they belong to Bethesda as they come in the base game. If you repack and use mine on your mod, just put me somewhere in the credits, I only messed with the shape of them.[/size][/font]
