**[Do not use HDT-SMP for NPCs if you have to use SMP.
  
Just make sure you use it only for your character.
  
Otherwise FPS drops rapidly and it causes CTD in the end.]
  
  
[I[b]f you don't know anything, or aren't sure about the relationship between
  
HDT-PE, HDT-SMP, T/BBP, etc, it is highly recommended you read this
  
first.**][/b][/size]

**How to Install**
  
1. Get the file

**How to Use Physics**
  
  
There are two ways to make physics wrok, by CBPC or by HDT-SMP.
  
  
You will see CBPC physics right away once you play game so let's skip this part.
  
  
Then how do you activate HDT-SMP rather than CBPC?
  
  
You should open Bodyslide and build Collision meshes for SMP physics first

You can set the hotkeys and activate it whenever you want or you can add spells if you don't want any new hotkeys.
  
  
If you prefer the spell, click 'Add Player 3BBB Physics Toggle Spell', then you can see the spell added in your spell tab.

**FAQ**
  
  
Q. Belly physics collision seems not working with SMP body. PE was fine.
  
A. It's almost impossible to make it work as PE does to Belly. It's just
  
 because SMP collision radius is too short. SMP is known to be much more
  
 precise than PE. It's just the stick can't reach the belly collision
  
mesh. You might think 'Then, do I have to give up?'. Maybe... But to
  
compensate for the issue, I made 'Belly' bone movable with 3BBB skeleton
  
 so that animators aniamte belly if necessary(like when a huge cock
  
kicks in). Nonetheless, this limit will be solved in SE. In LE, you
  
can't help it.
  
  
  
Q. There's no anus physics. What's wrong?
  
A. Nothing wrong with it actually. It's not supposed to move itself. It
  
won't move unless animators give keyframes to it. Anus doesn't belong to
  
 hdt physics. I decided to give up on Anus physics because it became too
  
 ugly and it didn't seem very realistic. Best leave it to animators.
  
  
  
Q. I have my own custom race other than your ygnord race. But it doesn't seem to work.
  
A. It could be complicated to solve this problem. You need to learn how
  
to make your new bodyslide for your custom race in Outfit Studio. In
  
Outfit Studio, load project BHUNP 3BBB body. Then, do Save As.. Name it a
  
 different name. Set the folder path where your custom race body mesh is
  
 located. Finished? Run the bodyslide you created just now.
  
  
  
Q. Breasts aren't moving at all. They are... not moving and detached from the body.
  
A. It should be absence of skeleton issue. Double check if your character has a proper 3BBB skeleton.nif.
  
  
  
Q. Some of Racemenu bone scale options aren't working. What's happening?
  
A. It's natural. Don't worry. 3BBB breasts bones are not subordinate to
  
bbp bones. They are independent bones. So any slides that handle bbp
  
bones won't work for 3bbb breasts.
  
  
  
Q. Racemenu Morphs isn't working in showracemenu.
  
A. It works. You just need to start a new save. I don't know but it looks like it's how it works.
