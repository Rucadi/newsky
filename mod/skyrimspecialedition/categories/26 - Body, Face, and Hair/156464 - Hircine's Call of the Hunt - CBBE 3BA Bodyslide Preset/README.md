**﻿The wilds had been silent for too long.****No wind in the pines. No howl in the dark. Fading signs of the eternal balance Hircine keeps between predator and prey.
  
  
That silence was broken when the forests shuddered under a sound older than any mortal tongue. A deep, resonant call that pulled at the blood of beasts and mortals alike.
  
  
Then, the transformed emerged, her body carrying the signature of the Hunt: smooth, glistening skin catching moonlight like wet stone, muscles drawn tight beneath a hunters frame, and the crown of horn and antler marking her as chosen
  
  
This was no mindless transformation. Every step she took through the trees was deliberate, every movement a calculated expression of grace and danger.
  
Her presence stirred the heart with equal parts of desire and fear. Primal instincts awakened in all of those around her.
  
  
Where [Stendarr's Lamb](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/156403)﻿ draws corruption into the open, the Hunt gives chase, her path cutting through forest and stone until the quarry falls. More than beast or prey, she is the relentless rhythm of pursuit, the flash of movement between shadow and moonlight, the closing distance that few or none outrun
  
  
Predators rejoice in her presence
  
Prey fear just the glimpse
  
And when the Hunt begins, her form is the omen that the chase will not end until balance is restored**
