Inspired by TEKKEN 6's hair customization system, Modular SMP Hair mixes and matches different options of hair: front & back.
  
Focused on medium to long hair. Also includes some fully unique hairstyles!
  
  
**Features:**
  

  
* 100+ new **'mix & match'** unisex hairstyles for humans & elves: 12 bases and 13 bangs.
A handful of unique hairstyles.
  
* High poly meshes & high resolution textures.
Physics-enabled through SMP, with a performant low bone count.
  
* esl-flagged .esp

**Requirements:**
  

  
* [Faster HDT-SMP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57339?)

**Optional:**
  

  
* [RaceMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19080?) ﻿can be helpful for reading the names of the hairstyles.

**Notes:**
  

  
* All the hairstyles are in the original 'Hair' slider. There aren't any new sliders to select, menus, etc.
There can be some floating near the forehead & clipping with some ear shapes. I tried to eliminate the worst cases- male human vs male elf morphs, etc- but doing meshes per race (because each one has their own unique head morph) is not something I want to do.
  
* *This can be easily fixed with a bit of manual sculpting, or a slider if you have one to move the related area!*
A config for [Headpart Whitelist](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106126?tab=description) is included.
  

**Q: Non SMP Version?**
  
**A:** Perms are open.
  
**Q: My body shape is very different from vanilla so the hairs clip! Can you make bodyslide files?**
  
**A:** Perms are open.

A handful of combinations are not implemented, notably:
  
Bangs D only goes with 'hair down' styles, and Bangs H only goes with 'hair up' styles.
  
Bangs that are longer than the base may not be available.

**Non-modular, Unique styles:** (currently all female ahhhh sorry)
  

  
* 'Eventually' - Medium long with a middle part *(this is the earliest collision hair I did, the mesh is fine but the bone work is a bit rough)*
'Intensity' - Medium long with a side part, one side tucked behind ear
  
* 'Rogueish' - Medium-short length ponytail with side bangs, lots of wisps
'Scryer' - Textured hair with a slicked back short-ish ponytail
  
* 'Dove' - Dense low bun with lots of wisps ~~★~~ *(Cayrice's WIP hairstyle from Sirenroot before using vanilla textures)*
'Oracle' - Medium long with a middle part, half-up into a bun, slightly wavy, very detailed
  
  
  
**Updates I'd like to do?**
  

  
* More pieces in general. Various lengths.
More styles with wavy~curly~coiled hair. Scryer is my first hairstyle with cylinders rather than planes, and I think it turned out well. Curly, medium-poly game-ready hair geometry workflows aren't documented well online :(
  
* Redo Base A's physics: more bones, more accurate collisions.
