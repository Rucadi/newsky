**Traverse Riften While Staying Underground**
  
  
The Ratway Passages is a small dungeon that expands on the Ratways in Riften. It adds a handful of new rooms, loot spots, and enemies... But more importantly, it connects several of Riften's existing locations to the city under the city. The Ratway now extends across the entire settlement, making it possible to reach many landmarks without ever having to leave the tunnels at all!
  
  
Locations that now connect to the Ratway include:
  

  
* **Beggar's Row:** Looks and feels like it should have been part of the Ratway to begin with. (Also explains how Hefid the Deaf, Salvianus, and similar characters managed to wander from the streets of Riften into the very depths of the vaults.)
**Honeyside:** If Mercer Frey can have a secret passage to the Ratway in his basement, why can't you?
  
* **Hall of the Dead:** Ever want to do some light grave robbing without having to go outside? Now you can!
**Riften Jail/Sewer:** Why would the guild helpfully provide a secret door and shadowmark to help you escape... And then dump you in the lake instead of bringing you safely back to headquarters?
  
* **The wilderness outside the city walls:** In case you ever want to get in and out of Riften undetected (without having to buy an entire house to do it).

  
All of this is easily accessible from a door in the final room of the Ratway (directly across from the entrance to the Ragged Flagon). No other edits are made to the Ratway, and the Ragged Flagon/Guild Headquarters remain wholly untouched.
  
  
**Compatibility:**
  

  
* Any mods that alter/revamp the city of Riften--the area outdoors, but still within the walls--will be compatible out of the box. This mod makes no edits to the city proper.
This mod also makes no edits to the Ragged Flagon or the Cistern; **anything that only edits the Thieves Guild HQ should be compatible.**

There *might* be conflicts with any other mod that alters Beggar's Row, Honeyside's interior, the final room of the Ratway, Riften's Hall of the Dead, and/or the Sewer under the jail. If there's one that I missed, feel free to test it out yourself and let me know if you see any weirdness.
