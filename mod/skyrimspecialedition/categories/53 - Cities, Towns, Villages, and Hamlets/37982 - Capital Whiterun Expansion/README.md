***"Whiterun's central location in Skyrim has made it a trading hub of the entire province."***I think this quote is actually true now. The city has been expanded in two directions
  
  
*Windhelm Expansion?*[Capital Windhelm Expansion at Skyrim Special Edition Nexus - Mods and Community](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42990)***Pls read description and sticky post before asking questions.**
  
  
**FEATURES INSIDE THE WALLS:**
  
- 14 new buildings, three are shops
  
- A bakery
  
- A shop selling construction goods 
  
- An alchemist/witch/magic goods shop
  
- A new playerhome, Bluesky Hall. It's got more room than Breezehome. It costs more as well.
  
  
- Around 22 new npcs
  
- The new npcs all have AI packs set up, so they'll do stuff around town. Practicing archery in the day, drinking mead in the evening and so on
  
- Many of the new NPCs will have some dialogue and/or greetings using vanilla voice acting
  
- A few of the new NPCs will have some custom-made outfits.
  
- A fence who will buy stolen goods, you don't have be a guild member to trade. You have to find him yourself though. 
  
  
- Various new decorations around town.
  
 - DLC-integration. Which is a fancy way to say I added in some stuff from DLCs. Like an oven, butter churns and yellow mountain flowers.
  
- Skyforge equipped with tanning rack, smelter, sharpening wheel and workbench.
  
  
You can now disable the planks easily ingame. Instructions are in the changelog/articles tab. 
  
  
**FEATURES OUTSIDE THE WALLS:**
  
  
- Some small decorations. 
  
- New tavern, called the Roadhouse.
  
  
Four new merchants will sell their goods on the way to the main gate:
  
- An imperial wine-merchant
  
- A redguard trader and his daughter, selling some clothes, gems and rum from Hammerfell
  
- A nord fur trader
  
- A high elf merchant who probably would rather have stayed in the Summerset isles
  
The merchants will go sleep in the Roadhouse during the night. 
  
  
**QUEST FEATURES - EFFECTS ON WHITERUN:**
  
  
There will be some small new scenes and decorations around town depending on the quests you complete. 
  
  
-[i] Dragon Rising*. After killing Mirmulnir (watchtower dragon) and you become thane, some very excited guards will be celebrating by the statue of Talos. Talk to them for a small gift. Mirmulnir's skull will be mounted above the entrance to Dragonsreach.
  
  
- *Battle for Whiterun* (Imperial). A few new imperial-themed decorations will appear in town after the battle. The effects of the White-Gold Concordant will also lead to some changes.
  
  
- *Battle for Whiterun* (Stormcloak). New offerings and decorations will appear by the shrine of Talos after the battle. Heimskr's temporary home will be a bit nicer.
  
  
- *Glory of the Dead*. After a reaching a certain stage of the Companions storyline, the skyforge will "awake". It's a fairly subtle effect.
  
  
- *The Blessings of Nature*. Some new Gildergreen saplings will pop up around town after finishing this quest, either ending is fine.
  
  
(Most of it should work even if you already completed the quests before installing)
  
  
**NEW QUEST(S)**
  
A short new quest revolving around a special horse has been added. Look for a note in the new district behind the Bannered Mare. Or by the Jarl's stables up outside Dragonsreach. Vanilla voice acting.
  
  
New in 1.2 = A quest involving a giant has been added. Speak to any innkeep in the Whiterun area to start. Even innkeeps from other mods should be fine - if they have the correct faction set up.
  
  
New in 1.2  = A quest to help out Igna with some issues in her basement has been added. Speak to Igna to start.
  
  
New in 1.3  = Thane Quest. Been to long since we've had a good bandit raid. A courier will find you.
  
  
**INSTALLATION**1. I recommend saving your game somewhere that's not Whiterun. Before installing. 
  
  
2. Choose one version. A is the normal one. B has fewer exterior (outside) edits. Only choose one.
  
  
2. Install as usual, I recommend using a mod organizer, like mod organizer. Or vortex. It's up to you. 
  
- If you wanna do a manual install there's 3 files. "SurWR.esp" "SurWR.bsa" and "SurWR - Textures.bsa". Put them in your Skyrim/Data folder.
  
  
3. Quicksave and reload, and you're good to go. 
  
  
For LOD, run DyndoLod or SSELODGEN. It is not required, but you probably wanna do it anyway. I used SSELODGEN, it's fairly straightforward.
  
  
You can disable the planks ingame. Instructions are in the changelog/articles tab.
  
  
**COMPATIBILITY**If it's not included here, I haven't tested it. So no point in asking me :-)
  
In general it works like this:
  
  
Mods editing vanilla NPC should be OK.
  
Mods editing texures should be OK.
  
Mods editing only interiors should be OK.
  
\_\_
  
Mod's editing objects or navmesh in Town will likely need a patch.
  
--- 
  
Immersive Laundry - Compatible
  
AI Overhaul - Compatible. At least I didn't notice anything weird. 
  
Bells of Skyrim - Compatible. Just did a quick test though.
  
Astronomer's Loft - Compatible
  
Wind District Breezehome - Reborn - Compatible (there's a patch)
  
  
**PATCHES ETC**I don't have time to make patches, but anyone is free to do so!
  
  
(if you check the "requirements" drop down on the top of the page, there's a list of many patches that
  
people have made. You can also search for the mod name on the nexus.
  
  
RS Children Overhaul Patch (in case Imsin's face looks weird in your game):
  
Check optional files on this mod page. Thanks Muffloid.
  
Patch for JK's only:
  
Check optional files on this mod page. Thanks NeduZ
  
  
**PERFORMANCE**More stuff generally means lower fps. Difficult to avoid. But I've tried to not go overboard & used occlusion planes to help performance a bit. 
  
But everyone has different ENBs, computers, mods. So results will vary. 
  
  
**Stuff you maybe want to know**The green grass in the screenshots is not from this mod.
  
~~I'm also working on a Windhelm overhaul.~~  It's done.
  
I'm also working on a Riften overhaul.
  
There might be some differences ingame from the screenshots. No huge difference, just some small details.
  
I might add some more quests for Whiterun in the future, if I have time.
  
**I don't have time to port this to the xbox or oldrim or whatever.** **You are free to port/patch if you want of course**.

Alexrhcp - Giant quest idea
  
The quest probably ended up being a bit different than you imagined it, but the basic structure is there
  
  
Oaristys and CD PROJEKT RED - Modder's resource pack
  
<https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68755>I used a few models from here that suited Whiterun,
  
  
dwemer156 - Nordic Wayshrines
  
<https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/97414>Used and edited a few models from here that I thought looked really good.
  
  
elinen - Whiterun house foundations (ported by sattyre)
  
<https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31558>Used some foundations for some of the Whiterun houses. Very helpful when placing new buildings in town.
  
  
Threeton - TD18 Lore-Friendly Hair
  
<https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/91391>
  
Neat hair. Used some hair for some of the new npcs.

As you can see the stuff above were from oldrim, I ran them through cathedral asset optimizer. Tested many times, works fine. 
  
  
JK's skyrim and Dawn of Skyrim - didn't use any assets. But got some inspiration! Like the antlers above the Drunken Huntsman entrance. And the guardhouse roof.
  
  
**PERMISSIONS**
  
There's a whole bunch of models that I've edited myself. You're can use them if you want. Just give me credit, link to this page. No paywalls allowed.
  
Not all of the stuff is made by me , and the files are maybe a bit unorganized. You can message me if you are not sure who the file belongs to.
  
  
**If you wanna make a patch/port or translation or whatever that's fine. You don't have to ask me.**
  
  
**SUPPORT**
  
  
I made a Ko-Fi page, if you want to buy me coffe.  There's some screenshots on stuff I am working on as well.
