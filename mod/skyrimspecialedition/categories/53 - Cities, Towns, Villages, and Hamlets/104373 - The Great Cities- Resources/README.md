**﻿The Great Cities - Resources**
  
  
The Great Cities- Resources contains a few base files required by some of the overhauls in my city overhaul series The Great Cities. It contains a few base assets and voice types so they can be easily used by multiple of my overhauls without the need for re-implementation. This file was originally on the page of [The Great Cities - Minor Cities and Towns](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20272) but this caused some confusion so that's why I've made a separate page. The are new additions since the old release. You must use this version for the latest Winterhold update!
