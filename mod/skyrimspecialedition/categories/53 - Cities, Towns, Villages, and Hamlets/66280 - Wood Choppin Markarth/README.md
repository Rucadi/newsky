Why the hell there is not even a single woodchopping block in Markarth?
  
Now there are 2.
  
  
One near the blacksmith.
  
One near the furnace on the corner of the city.
  
  
Both with a woodcutters axe on the side.
  
  
Extremely simple mod that can everyone can create.
  
  
Compability:
  
Pretty much anything,
  
Not tested with Markarth overhauls tho.
