[font=Georgia]KARTHWASTEN[/font]
  
~A Skyrim SE Addition~
  
  
  
  
Karthwasten was once a great city, 'the' city in the Reach during the 2nd Era. In Skyrim, it's only 3 houses.
  
It's due time we change all that.
  
Now, Karthwasten reflects that of a city once proud, now abandoned for the security of Markarth, and subjected to the 'massacre at Karthwasten' as spoken about during the Seasons Unending questline. The town now has a massive graveyard and assorted ruins to reflect this, with a unique new look unmatched in the rest of the province that fits nicely in the highlands of the Reach.
  
  
The new town comes with: 
  
-New buildings and walls to reflect its lore
  
-A general merchant, outdoors
  
-A barkeep, outdoors
  
-An alchemist/enchanter with stations in a new building
  
-A few new npc's
  
-Redesigned interiors for Karthwasten Hall
  
-Several new idle markers around town
  
-Fully navmeshed
  
  
-No Player Home Version, may be added in the future-
