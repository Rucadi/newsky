This mod edits the location near Pavo's House and Kolskeggr Mine. It overhauls the settlement and applies dynamic changes that take place after you complete the quest to clear the Forsworn out. When you first arrive at the location there will be noticeable signs of the violent raid. After you complete the vanilla quest from Pavo Attius at Left Hand Mine, you’ll be able to see some additional changes that evolve over time as activity returns to the mine. This includes a rebuilt house, two new miners, an extra guard, and other small details.
  
  
*\*\*\* Requires the latest Environs Master Plugin (v2.00), found [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/91160).
  
\*\*\* Do NOT update mid-game from a version earlier than v3.00.**\*\*\* Installing mid-game is not recommended.*

Skyrim's world space tends to feel very static. Despite a civil war, dragons, and vampires, not much ever changes. The Environs series implements small, dynamic changes that take place over time to help make the land of Skyrim feel more alive, to help give a sense that events are occurring and time was passing throughout a playthrough.

When you first reach Left Hand Mine there's a dialogue scene where Pavo Attius describes how he narrowly escaped a ferocious Forsworn attack on Kolskeggr Mine and how nearly everyone was killed. However when you go there yourself, there are no signs of violence at all, just a few Forsworn casually milling around.
  
  
 ***﻿"Kolskeggr Mine is lost, friend. Forsworn killed everyone..... Gat and I are the only survivors."  - Pavo Attius***
  
  
With this mod, there will now actually be some signs of this violent raid, including a burning house, the bodies of miners, and signs of ransacking. Then, once the miscellaneous quest to clear out the Forsworn is complete, the destruction will be cleaned up. Two new miners will eventually arrive at Kolskeggr. The first will arrive soon after the mine is reopened and begin repairing the destroyed house, the second will arrive later, and camp near the mine's entrance. An additional guard will also appear, along with a guard tower near the bridge to deter future Forsworn incursions.
  
  
The rebuilding stage will begin after the miscellaneous quest given by Pavo Attius is complete and at least **12 days** have passed in game. After this, the final rebuilt state will be enabled after at least another **20 days**. There are invisible checkpoints just outside the gates of each major city that check for the quest requirement and set the next time-based requirements when you pass through it. The goal here is to make the sequence take place gradually, to make it feel as though things are changing in the world space with the passage of time.
  
  
Note: The previous version of the mod triggered the later stages via player level requirements. The new update changes this to use a time-based check, by reading the number of in-game days passed. This is the main difference with the new update.
  
  
  
~ FEATURES AND CHANGES ~
  
  
﻿- overhauled location, added clutter, added ruins and architecture with customized meshes
  
﻿- 2 new NPCs who work in the mine, (and a dog)
  
﻿- a new house and a campsite near the mine's entrance
  
﻿- the new house begins destroyed, but is eventually rebuilt
  
﻿- overhauled Pavo's house, including dynamic interior
  
﻿- added a guard tower, and an extra guard
  
﻿- new NPCs have reused voice lines for greetings
  
﻿- small but necessary navmesh edits
  
﻿- new guard and banners appropriately reflect civil war status
  
﻿- several occlusion planes added to minimize performance impact
  
  
Customized meshes use vanilla farmhouse and Nordic dungeon textures; appearance may vary depending on your texture mods
  
  
DynDOLOD is recommended for proper lod. Otherwise distant lod will appear as the vanilla farmhouse. If you're unfamiliar with DynDOLOD, here's [a great place to start](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=encZYHEeQrQ).

This patch is not required if you load Environs - Kolskeggr after Lux Via. It's provided because not everyone will read this statement. It forwards Environs' navmesh changes.

**WiZkiD's Pavo's House** \*
  
﻿Only keeps the rooftop foliage and some of the exterior clutter from WiZkiD's mod; ﻿It does not keep WiZkiD’s unique meshes at all as they are ultimately incompatible; ﻿In my humble opinion there isn't much point in using both mods, but it's here if you want it.

To work, this mod needs a way to occasionally check certain requirements: completion of the Kolskeggr quest, and the number of days passed in game. To do this, there are invisible checkpoints which use a simple script to check if the quest and time-based requirements have been met, and enables the correct objects when true. These checkpoints are placed just outside the gates of each major city in Skyrim (Whiterun, Solitude, Markarth, Windhelm, and Riften), areas most people will pass through often enough. This is a way to ensure each stage is triggered off screen, and is relatively simple and non-bloaty, as there are no constantly running scripts. It should allow the sequence of stages to occur naturally over your playthrough.
  
  
The exact sequence of the mod is the following:
  
  
**﻿Initial Stage**
  
Pillaged by forsworn, burned house and signs of carnage (initial encounter)
  
  
**﻿Second Stage**
  
Forsworn defeated. Mine reopened. New NPC begins rebuilding house, some debris removed 
  
Trigger requirement:  "freeformkolskeggr 100" is complete (quest given by Pavo Attius)
  
  
**Final Stage**
  
House rebuilt, second miner arrives, new guard, additional clutter
  
Trigger requirement: player gains 7 additional levels
