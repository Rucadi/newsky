# Better Tel Mithryn
- Author: YsCordelan
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

This mod is my attempt to improve the Telvanni settlement of Tel Mithryn, with the emphasis being on utility over aesthetics (which isn't to say that I don't try to make it look good, just that I focus on adding things which serve a purpose).   
   
   
   

[font=impact]Features[/font]

  

  
* New dock area east of the main tower
New main gate   
* A guard house near the gate
4 guards (3 day shift, 1 night shift)   
* A general goods shop with un-enchanted versions of Dunmer and Telvanni outfits available for purchase
3 new named NPCs:   
[list]
  
* Ranis Oren, outfitter / general merchant
Tonas Oren, fisherman   
* Llunela Oren, aspiring blacksmith (you can buy weapons and armor from her mother)

[\*]Two ash yam gardens   
[\*]A scathecraw garden   
[\*]An outdoor dining area   
[\*]A full set of crafting stations   
[\*]Main tower interior changes:   

  
* Added an alchemy station
Cleaned up Neloth’s bedroom. He’s still a slob, but there are limits…   
* Turned the storeroom into a guest bedroom, with a bed for the player and safe storage
Fixed some floating furniture and oddly placed objects   

[\*]All new NPCs have fully detailed daily schedules. Guards use recycled dialogue from the Raven Rock guards (where it makes sense). The Orens use generic dialogue (for the time being). All new NPCs are flagged as protected so they won’t die to random dragons or ash spawn attacks.   
[\*]Relevant Unofficial Patch edits have been forwarded   
[\*]Cleaned with SSEEdit   
[/list]
  
   
Optional New Prison   
   
I’ve Included an optional esp that gives Tel Mithryn its own crime & prison system (it was originally part of Raven Rock’s crime faction). I made it a separate esp because it edits the Actor records for all NPCs in Tel Mithryn, and so has more potential for incompatibilities. If you use Mator's Merge Plugins Standalone, you can merge it into the main file.
  
   
Have fun trying to escape Tel Mithryn’s prison. The Telvanni don’t mess around…
  
   
   
   

[font=impact]Installation[/font]

  
Just extract the contents of the archive into your Skyrim Special Edition data folder, or use your mod manager of choice. This mod is safe to install mid-playthrough; just make sure you save somewhere away from Tel Mithryn before loading it up for the first time.   
   
   
   

[font=impact]Compatibility[/font]

  
This mod will generally be incompatible with mods that edit Tel Mithryn and its immediate surroundings. I recommend loading this mod after mods that edit light placement (like Relighting Skyrim or ELFX & ELFX Exteriors) but before mods that edit imagespaces and light settings (like ELE or the ELFX Enhancer).

So who's Mithryn and what had I better tell her?
