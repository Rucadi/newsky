**﻿Mara's Embrace**
  
  
Mara's Embrace is a newly added brothel, located in one of the isolated, dark corners of Riften - just barely in view of everday life. The new building is nicely squeezed into the ally corner by Honeyside home, seamlessly fitting into Riften.﻿
  
  
Open for business 7 days a week - except the bar, only open between 10 in the morning till midnight.

**﻿What's Inside?**The interior is designed to reflect the ironic name, as it does include a statue to Mara but also, of course, dedications to Dibella. Unlike the Crimson Corner, Mara's Embrace is much more open to a wider range of clientele as Riften and its patrons aren't as.. wealthy; alongside Riften's significantly more seedy reputation the Brothel only caters as much as it feels necessary to keep customers returning. 
  
  
There two patrons solemnly drinking alone on the first floor, alongside the Barkeep keeping a tab on those who enter. For members of the Thieves Guild who pass by, there's much more to steal in this building than others with more and more items laying around - gold included. 
  
  
The upper floor is where the brothels' girls work, of which there are three; but unlike the Crimson Corner all of the rooms are roughly identical in size and available luxuries. At the end of the hall of the upper floor, there is a door to the buildings exterior balcony where patrons looking to enjoy a drink may relax.
