# Winterhold - The Bubbling Brew

Winterhold lacks most shops as a result of the great collapse. However, that was nearly 80 years ago!
  
  
  
Following in the footsteps of my mod [Dawnstar - The Hawking Horker](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/112110), I present the Bubbling Brew, an alchemist store for Winterhold.﻿
  
  
This adds one building, The Bubbling Brew, which is owned and operated by "Idryk".
  
The building replaces an existing destroyed building to minimize the footprint.
  
The shop sells an assortment of alchemy goods. It kinda makes sense that an alchemist would be here, helping supply the College with materials.
  
Idryk runs the shop during typical shop hours and sandboxes at the Inn when not working.
  
The interior is fully navmeshed, as well as some minor navmesh edits to the exterior.
  
  
Natively compatible with mods by [RubberSpaghetti](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/36481565?tab=user+files), however, if not using the optional patch you may notice some clutter clipping.
