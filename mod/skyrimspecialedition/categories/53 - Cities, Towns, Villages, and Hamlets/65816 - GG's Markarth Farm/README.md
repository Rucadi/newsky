GG's Markarth Farm main purpose is to improve Salvius Farm that has always been kind of lackluster. I already reworked both bridges in Lux Via so that coming in Markarth feels a bit better but I'm now planning to improve the whole road toward this awesome city. This mod is reworking both vanilla Salvius farm and its surroundings.

- This mod doesn't modify Salvius farm interiors, building has been moved so door needs new teleport datas but I'm not editing interior at all.
  
- Solitude mill has been replaced with a full dwemer steam powered mill and I also added a maintenance building with a brand new NPC. A mad imperial obsessed with dwemer stuff.
  
- A new farm has been added along with an underground mushroom farm. Do not expect wheat in such harsh environment, Markarth people will get mushrooms for diner.
  
- Farm layout has been reworked, a new access has been added and the road part has been reworked too.
  
- A new waterwheeel has been added and both bridges areas have been reworked to be fully compatible with Lux Via.

**This mod is a standalone**. There's a specific version for Lux Via users though since all resources are already used in Via, so this version is way lighter.
  
All new interiors have been designed to be compatible with Lux design. A small patch with brighter lighting will certainly be uploaded at some point for non ENB/console users or people with ENBs using non compatible settings.
  
Main plugin is tagged esm to prevent large refs issues, it shouldn't conflict much with most mods but if needed I'll upload a light plugin to be sure landscape and navm edits are forwarded correctly.
  
All refs have been compacted but I won't tag it as esl cause with new interiors it would need me to set all refs as persistent. I won't do that myself but it can be done.

Download, install. Easy peasy. No FOMOD, just pick the version you need depending if you're using Lux Via or not. Via version is lighter since all resources are already included and thus not needed.

Not compatible out of the box with mods editing the Salvius farm area for obvious reasons. Many mods editing Markarth Entrance aren't usually editing this farm much though.
  
It may also conflict with mods editing navmeshes around both bridges since I'm editing navm there. A patch is provided in the Via optional version though.
