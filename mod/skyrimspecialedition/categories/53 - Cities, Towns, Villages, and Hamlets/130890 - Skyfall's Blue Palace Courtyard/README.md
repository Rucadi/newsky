**~ Introduction ~**
  
Completely revamps the entrance to the Blue Palace - the entrance is now dignified, elevated, and centered (it now finally matches the interior cell entrance). No longer will entering the Blue Palace feel like using the servants side door like in vanilla. Entering the palace will now feel important. Immersion! :)
  
  
The Blue Palace courtyard now features a grand palace staircase, a tidy well-kept garden and green space. Everything in the garden layout is organized and well cared for, fitting for a regal palace.
