Lux Via Kynareth Addon is replacing the shrine of Kynareth statue from Lux Via with Mandragora's version which is way more consistent lore wise. I also improved a bit the area and made a custom altar.

- Custom statue mesh with more partitions to manage all parts separately.
  
- Custom altar to replace the bowl I was using previously. 
  
- Area is slightly reworked to fit the new statue. I liked that antique statue but it definitely wasn't Kynareth !
  
- As usual, mod is tagged ESL and doesn't count toward the plugin limit.
  
- Lux Via and Statue of Kynareth are both a requirement for obvious reasons.

Download, install. Overwrite Statue of Kynareth mesh and Lux Via plugin. No rocket science.

It should be compatible with everything. Just don't forget to let the new statue mesh I made win all conflicts cause I had to partition it a bit to separate the bird and the base.
