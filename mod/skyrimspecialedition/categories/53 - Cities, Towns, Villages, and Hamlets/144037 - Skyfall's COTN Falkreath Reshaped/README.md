# Skyfall's COTN Falkreath Reshaped
- Author: Skyfall515
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/144037


**~ Introduction ~**
  
Completely revamps the Cities of the North - Falkreath's models with newly reshaped models with the intent to make the architecture blend in better with Skyrim's overall look and tone, while trying to stay faithful to the original architectural style.
  
  
I have so much admiration and love for the creative vision and style of the original COTN Falkreath. However, there were some visual aspects that sometimes felt jarring to me. Therefore, with JPSteel2's blessing and approval, I did some personal preference changes to the models to allow me to enjoy COTN's Falkreath models more. If you like the original COTN vibe, I think that's wonderful! But if you're like me and desiring a more grounded look, this should help.
  
  
If you have any questions or experience any issues, please let me know. Hope this brings you more enjoyment in your game!
  
  
  
 **~ Main Features ~** 
  
- Mesh replacer only (no plugin).
  
- Dimensions follow the original footprint as close as possible, for maximum compatibility.
  
- The roofs, center roof beams, and window frames of all buildings see the most visual changes.
  
- Jarl's keep now has detailed Scandinavian dragon head motifs on the roofs (inspired by ESO).
  
- Added additional details to some models to give more character and style.
  
- Improved texture choices on models. For example, the watchtowers and gate wall now use Whiterun's stone wall texture. The Jarl's Keep now uses Farmhouse roof tile texture. This brings more consistency and cohesion to the overall look and vibe.
  
- Improved uv map scaling (how the texture looks on each model).
  
- Optimized reshaped models to keep in line with the original drawcalls, etc.
  
- LODs included. If a Dyndolod user, I would recommend regenerating your lods afterwards.
  
- Normal meshes version, complex material version, and parallax version available.
  
  
  
**~ Requirements ~**None, technically! This mesh replacer will only replace COTN Falkreath's models. Therefore, of course, if you use the city overhaul "Cities of the North - Falkreath", you'll see the changes there. However, if you use other mods that also utilize these COTN assets, you'll see these new changes! For example, town overhauls such as "Thuldor's Ivarstead" and "Schlitzohr's Riverwood" will be completely overhauled. 
  
  
  
**~ Compatibility and Load Order ~**
  
Should work out of the box with anything and everything that uses COTN Falkreath models/assets. Load these new meshes AFTER any mod that includes COTN Falkreath's models/assets.
