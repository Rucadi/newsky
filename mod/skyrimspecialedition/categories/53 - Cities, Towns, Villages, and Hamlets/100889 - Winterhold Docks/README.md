*Ok, so now Winterhold has a massive wall and some additional houses. It feels more like a reasonable city. But one thing I badly missed is a docks area. It's insane that there's no dock in the vanilla game. Think about it; this is a hold capital situated far into the frozen north, which can only be accessed by a long road. Just imagine if there were some magical way to travel quickly to the other coastal cities for trade. Hm. Winterhold also has zero hope of growing any food through agriculture. Wouldn't it be amazing if one could just extract food out of the vast, unfrozen ocean down the cliffs? But no, Winterhold would rather starve and freeze all alone than build a shitty little dock... Ok, enough of that; here's that dock.*
