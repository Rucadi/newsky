Original Mod by [x360Flipx](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/2948294):  [Beautiful Cities SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3185)﻿
  
  
First, let me thank x360Flipx for creating the original mod, and giving me permission to make these changes and post them.  The changes his mod made to Skyrim's major cities, was my personal favourite, for trees and plants.  JK's Skyrim, also one of my favourites, was not compatible due to clipping issues, which is how this came to be.
  
  
I only made changes to Beautiful Cities itself, and did not edit JK's Skyrim.  This is not a patch.  It does not need the original Beautiful Cities, and it does not use JK's Skyrim as a master.  This mod can be run all by itself - but it might look odd in some places.  If you don't use JK's Skyrim, I'd suggest using the original Beautiful Cities SSE after cleaning it in SSEEdit.
  
  
I mainly removed plants/items originally added by Beautiful Cities that caused major clipping issues with JK's Skyrim.  Some items that could be nudged over a bit were moved, instead of removed.
  
  
Some very minor clipping was left on purpose to create an overgrown look in some areas.  Your experience here may vary depending on the tree/plant mods you use.
  
  
I tried to remove edits that were not confined to the 5 major cities (Whiterun, Solitude, Markarth, Windhelm, and Riften), as I believe this was outside of the original mod's scope.
  
  
I fixed the wild edits i found in the original.
  
  
I cleaned this with SSEEdit, so it no longer has the original's errors.
  
  
The screen shots were taken with only JK's Skyrim and this mod loaded.  I disabled my ENB, as well, for them.
  
  
There are two option patches available.  One to remove a few trees/plants added in front of Legacy of the Dragonborn museum exterior.  The other is intended to be used with this mod, Dawn of Skyrim, JK's Skyrim, and the pach for those two.
  
  
If I missed something, please let me know and I'll try to update/fix it.
