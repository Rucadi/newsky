Dawn of Skyrim is a script-free overhaul of each of Skyrim five major cities (Whiterun, Windhelm, Riften, Solitude, and Markarth). It features new interior locations including temples, houses, and shops that are fully integrated into the radiant quest system (including the Thieves Guild quests). New NPCs sell new lore-friendly items and have detailed schedules.

Before installing, please make sure that any existing files from any other versions of Dawn of Skyrim are completely uninstalled from your Data folder.
  
  
Install as normal via MO2 or Vortex.
  
  
If you install on an existing save and find that some vanilla items have not updated their position (this often occurs in Solitude), please use the pcb command to reset the cells.

**The 1.5 update fixes the name of the .esp.  Please do NOT update to this version mid-game or if using compatibility patches that look for the old .esp name as a master file.  1.5 does not add any new features, but any potential future updates will keep the new .esp name.**

Q: How much will this impact performance?
  
A: Your performance depends on a lot of factors and the impact of this mod will vary greatly depending on your rig and other mods. Thanks to the SE engine update, this mod has a lesser impact on performance than it does in LE.
  
  
Q: If I send you my specs / mod list can you tell me what my performance impact will be?
  
A: No. You'll have to test things for yourself. That's just a part of modding. Sorry.
  
  
Q: Will you release this for consoles?
  
A: No, and no you can't port it.
  
  
Q: Will you make a patch for / a version without \_\_\_ ?
  
A: Nope! But if you want to make a patch for something, please feel free. I am happy to host patches on this page, and you are welcome to upload patches yourself provided my original mod is required. If you make a patch, let me know so I can provide a link!
  
  
Q: Will you make a version of just individual cities?
  
A: No.
  
  
Q: Is this mod compatible with \_\_\_?
  
A: Please refer to the list in the section below. If it is not listed, I don't know.
