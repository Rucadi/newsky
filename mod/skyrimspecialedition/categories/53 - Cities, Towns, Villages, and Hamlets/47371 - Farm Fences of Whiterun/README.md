Replaces most of the ruined low stone walls surrounding the Whiterun farms with actual well-maintained traditional wooden farm fences. Added a chicken coop for immersion (poor chickens with no shelter). Note that there’s still plenty of the ruined low stone walls surrounding the area, but on the outskirts of the active farming area.
  
  
Lore friendly as they looked the same in Oblivion :)
  
  
The why? I made this mod as I was always bothered by active farmers that continued to work with rubble nearby. This also opens the farming fields visibility a bit as you can see through all of the fencing.
  
  
No navmesh changes were made. I only placed wooden fences exactly where the old low stone walls were.
  
  
Would still like to give the small farm on the East side of Whiterun the same treatment. I might also make a few other lightweight enhancements later on.

.ESL flagged. This is the first time I've ever done this - so please let me know if it's worked properly, looks like it on my end. 
  
  
Cleaned with xEdit.
