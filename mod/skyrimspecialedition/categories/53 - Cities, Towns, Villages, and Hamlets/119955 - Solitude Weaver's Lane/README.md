**Solitude Weaver's L﻿﻿ane
  
[b][color=#ea9999]*[size=4]Adds a tavern, a bookstore, and four homes just outside the Solitude main gate. Be sure to check out [Miggyluv's NPC Replacers - Solitude Weaver's Lane](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120304/)﻿. This is my preferred look for these NPCs.***[/size][/color][/b]
  
Solitude to me is a very well done city with a strong aesthetic. However as the capital and "largest city" of Skyrim, it still feels a bit small. There are plenty of excellent mods that overhaul the Solitude worldspace inside the gates, and plenty of excellent mods that overhaul the docks area, but none I could find that adjusted the entrance outside the gates to my preferences. So I made one.
  
  
Solitude Weaver's Lane is thus named because a number of its inhabitants engage in weaving as a profession - if you peek inside their houses you will indeed find spinning wheels, wool/flax baskets, and tailoring tools. They are not tailors themselves - but do sell their wares to the ladies at Radiant Raiments. Solitude Weaver's Lane is located just outside the main gates of Solitude, offering a vibrant and prosperous little district to extend Solitude to be more like the city it should be.

The mod is set up to use vanilla Solitude meshes for the exteriors and interiors of the buildings, which means they should shift appropriately according to any/all mesh or texture replacers you use.
  
  
  
**Inhabitants
  
  
![](https://i.ibb.co/Pjt7JZf/Miggyluv-Solitude-Weaver-s-Lane.png)**
  
**Matilis** and **Storjar** run **The Bull and Bear Roadhouse**, a tavern and restaurant just outside the main gate of Solitude. Matilis is recently retired from the Imperial Legion, and Storjar is a former member of Ulfric's militia (the original one, from the Markarth Incident 20 years past). The one rule of the Roadhouse is that everyone leaves talk of the war outside, and is civil to each other inside.
  
  
**Ansbi Winter-Light** is an independently wealthy older woman who runs **Tell Another Tale**, a well stocked bookstore along the main road into Solitude. She sells a wide variety of books, as well as a few scrolls and minor spell tomes. Ansbi also keeps her guest room open for travelers, as she likes the company (safe storage containers and two free beds on the upper floor).
  
  
**Bronlod the Bold** lives in the house just by the walls, and is a member of the Solitude Guard. His wife **Rettia** works part time in The Bull and Bear Tavern, and has a bit of a chequered past she is attempting to move beyond.
  
  
**Sebione** lives in the second home as you head towards Solitude. She makes a living weaving, bringing in wool from connections back in High Rock.
  
  
**Kjolda** lives in the third home and is also a weaver. Her daughter Sonji (not appearing in this mod - I couldn't get a child appearance overhaul set up that I liked) was recently injured and has gone to seek medical care.
  
  
**Raashid** and **Bjara**, a mercenary couple, live in the final house. They're in between jobs and spend most of their day relaxing or hanging out at the Roadhouse.
  
  
  
**Compatibilities / Patches**
  
  
**[Miggyluv's NPC Replacers - Solitude Weaver's Lane](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120304/) is my preferred look for these NPCs. Check it out!**
  
  
**Vanilla Hair Patch** in Optional Files for those who prefer that look (also has no makeup for the four ladies who would normally have some subtle makeup). If you also use AI Overhaul make sure to get the Vanilla Hair version of the AI Overhaul patch.
  
  
If you have **random trees** blocking doorways and clipping with buildings, that is the **Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch (USSEP)** adding those trees, it is not a conflict with a tree mod. There is a patch in optional files that fixes this, for whichever tree mod you use (or no tree mod).
  
  
These mods are excellent options to pair with mine, and are compatible (or will swiftly be made so with a patch when I'm notified):

All screenshots were taken running this mod alongside Cathedral Weathers and Rudy ENB for Cathedral Weathers. The NPC looks in my screenshots are as they will appear in your game - though they will use whatever bodies and textures you have set up.
  
  
This mod was created with the 1.640 version of the Creation Kit so is compatible with all SE/AE versions of Skyrim. It is not ESP-FE flagged and should not be made ESP-FE (this would break all the patches). This mod has no running scripts or quests. I give full permission to anyone to merge this mod with any other mod and release that version, thereby saving an esp slot for that load order. You'll need to check permissions on whatever mod you merge this with, however.
