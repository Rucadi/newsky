Project Porthole - Custom Doors for Modded Cities
  
  
One of the most impactful forms of modding is that of Architecture additions. Bethesda for whatever reasons it may be, had to leave much of the potential diversity in skyrims environment on the cutting room floor, only opting for five major cities with Unique architecture, with the rest of the Cities, towns and villages all forced to share the same infamous "farmhouse01" asset. 
  
  
Fantastic Mods such as The Great Cities, Cities of the North, and more, do immense work in the name of bringing the modding community forward in terms of architectural variety. One of the objects that usually falls through the cracks in these overhauls, is doors. after noticing many many cases of gorgeous new buildings using horrendous vanilla doors , I decided it was a good time to create some new ones for consistencies sake. The new doors follow the architectural style of the overhaul they are meant to synergize with. For example, the wood color of the new building will match the new door every time.
