**﻿Crimson Corner Club**
  
The Crimson Corner is a new addition to Solitude, adding a brothel to the city. The brothel is located between The Winking Skeever and Angeline's Aromatics, and is squeezed in the alley between the two buildings. The exterior has a neatly fitting design so it isn't too overt and is open 24/7.

What's inside?
  
  
The inside is designed with wealth in mind - no poor patrons will be found here. The idea is that the location is designed to cater to Solitude, Skyrim and any foreign visitor of high standing and wealth. The furniture is luxury and the decorations equally so, all chosen with decadence in mind. The building includes a barkeeper that'll sell you food and drink, bards playing throughout the day to keep the shuffling patrons entertained. 
  
  
There is a handful of patrons shuffling around the first floor where the bar is, along with the Madame in the back room keeping tabs on the bookkeeping. There is, of course, plenty of things to be stolen in the building too if you're a kleptomaniac, and lastly but not least - the second floor.
  
  
On the second floor there is the rooms for the women working at the establishment, alongside a side room for them to be resting in between working hours. Two rooms look mostly similar, however, there is the room for the wealthiest of patrons which features much more floorspace and most importantly, a much larger bed.
