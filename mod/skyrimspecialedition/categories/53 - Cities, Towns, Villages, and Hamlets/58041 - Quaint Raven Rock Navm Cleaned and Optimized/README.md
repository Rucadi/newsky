Love Quaint Raven Rock but after looking at the navmesh I couldnt unsee what had been done. Neither could Wolfman5750 so we went resolved the issues (majority of the  work is from Wolfman). The gate now has nav so followers and npcs can once again travel through it. Implemented some nav cuts on some clutter and the gate as well.
