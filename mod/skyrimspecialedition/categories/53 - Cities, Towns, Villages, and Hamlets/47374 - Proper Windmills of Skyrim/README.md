Using the wonderful meshes of Brumbek’s SMIM's windmills, I’ve scaled them from size 1.0 (vanilla) to 1.6x and have gone to each farm and carefully repositioned (height and some angled) each sail fan so that it doesn’t clip with any objects.
  
  
I'm very aware that this mod idea already exists out there - however, this is my improved take on it.
  
  
I've scaled them as big as they reasonably can be from a logical and aesthetic standpoint. Each windmill's fan blade has been uniquely adjusted by hand inside of the Creation Kit to get the best possible placement and look. 
  
  
ESL flagged.
  
  
Enjoy!!
