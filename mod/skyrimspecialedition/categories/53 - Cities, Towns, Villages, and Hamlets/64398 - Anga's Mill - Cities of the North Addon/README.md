[Cities of the North](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/?BH=4&RH_ModList=nav%3Atrue%2Chome%3Afalse%2Ctype%3A0%2Cuser_id%3A0%2Cgame_id%3A1704%2Cadvfilt%3Atrue%2Cinclude_adult%3Afalse%2Cpage_size%3A20%2Cshow_game_filter%3Afalse%2Copen%3Atrue%2Csearch%5Bfilename%5D%3ACities+of%2Bthe%2BNorth%2Csearch%5Bauthor%5D%3AJPSteel2%2Csearch%5BOLD_mname%5D%3AJPSteel2&RH_ModList=nav:true,home:false,type:0,user_id:0,game_id:1704,advfilt:true,include_adult:false,page_size:20,show_game_filter:false,open:true,search%5Bfilename%5D:Cities+of+the+North,search%5BOLD_mname%5D:JPSteel2)﻿ is a fantastic series of mods that aims to give the disregarded minor hold capitals proper unique architecture instead of just using generic farmhouses like any other small town. This really helps to bring the minor holds the unique character that they lacked from their major counterparts. 
  
  
Anga's Mill is a small settlement in the Pale and I thought it would really benefit from mimicking the design of Cities of the North's Dawnstar. I whipped this mod up to see that idea through.

* Replaces the two farmhouses with new meshes from Cities of the North - Dawnstar.
Replaces the lumber mill with a new mesh from Cities of the North - Falkreath.
  
* Overhauls the interiors of Aeri's House and the Anga's Mill Common House with new interior meshes.

  
**Recommended Mods**
  
  
None of the [Cities of the North](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/?BH=4&RH_ModList=nav%3Atrue%2Chome%3Afalse%2Ctype%3A0%2Cuser_id%3A0%2Cgame_id%3A1704%2Cadvfilt%3Atrue%2Cinclude_adult%3Afalse%2Cpage_size%3A20%2Cshow_game_filter%3Afalse%2Copen%3Atrue%2Csearch%5Bfilename%5D%3ACities+of%2Bthe%2BNorth%2Csearch%5Bauthor%5D%3AJPSteel2%2Csearch%5BOLD_mname%5D%3AJPSteel2&RH_ModList=nav:true,home:false,type:0,user_id:0,game_id:1704,advfilt:true,include_adult:false,page_size:20,show_game_filter:false,open:true,search%5Bfilename%5D:Cities+of+the+North,search%5BOLD_mname%5D:JPSteel2) mods are required in order for this to function, but I highly recommend you use them all (or at the very least [Dawnstar](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28952)).
  
  
This mod was partly inspiried by MissleMan's [Half-Moon Mill - Cities of the North Addon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64360) and Monster23's [Cities of the North - Morthal Addon Hjaalmarch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35181). I recommend both.
  
  
I also think this mod fits really well alongside Jelidity's [Kolskeggr Mine - A Great Towns and Villages of the Reach Addon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64265) and [Darkwater Crossing - A Great Towns and Villages of Eastmarch Addon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64266), regardless if you use the rest of the [Great Towns and Villages](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/10182460?tab=user+files) series or not.

I have attempted to make as little changes to this area as possible, but there is still a good possibility it will conflict with other mods that edit the Anga's Mill area. This mod will definitely be incompatible with mods that edit the Aeri's House and Anga's Mill Common House cells.
