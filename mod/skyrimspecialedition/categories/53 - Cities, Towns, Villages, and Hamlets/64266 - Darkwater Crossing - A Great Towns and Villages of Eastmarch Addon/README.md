**What does this mod do?**
  
This mod uses the Great Cities series' Eastmarch Town/Village house architecture to overhaul the single house in Darkwater Crossing, effectively finalising coverage of non-farm houses in the hold.
  
  
This settlement mod is completely standalone, however, it is intended to be used alongside the following:
  

  
* [The Great Village of Mixwater Mill](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36350)﻿
[The Great Village of Kynesgrove](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42639)﻿
  

  

**Compatibility**

  
This mod will likely conflict with mods that edit Darkwater Crossing and/or the interior of the house.
  
  
**I currently offer this mod as is and will not be providing any patches for other mods**, although people are free to make and upload any patches they like.
