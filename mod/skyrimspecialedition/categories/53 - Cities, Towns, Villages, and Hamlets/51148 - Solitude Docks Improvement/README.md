In a vanilla game Solitude Docks look very empty. My mod adds new NPCs and details to the docks. There are three versions available for download:
  
Main version
  
Compatible version (without lanterns and light sources)
  
Very compatible version (just a decorations, no npcs, lanterns and light sources)
  
  
Compatible list:
  
AI Overhaul SSE- should be compatible
  
Lanterns of Skyrim- compatible (you must use compatible version)
