Cities of the North is a great series of city overhauls by JPSteel2. They bring great life to the various holds, and along with it, a lot of drawcalls in a heavily modded setup. This mod aims to improve occlusion for Falkreath. If you only use COTN - Falkreath without other mods that affect the area, you probably won't notice any difference. Originally developed for Tempus Maledictum, a Wabbajack list by Lively, I was able to improve my fps from 20s-40s in town, to 40-60s by adding extra occlusion boxes to buildings. Hope it helps you too. ESL flagged for your enjoyment.
  
  
Installation:
  
1) Delete NMM from your computer and install any other mod manager
  
2) Install using that very same mod manager
  
3) Load this after COTN - Falkreath. Which it will since COTN - Falkreath is a required master.
  
  
  
Compatibility: probably everything unless it changes COTN building locations.
