**Docks of Riverwood**

  
  
The northern area of Riverwood has been completely revamped with a new dock. The dock includes some hidden shrines, lumber mill product, inn supplies, fishing material, and a social area for the residents of Riverwood. 
  
  
**New Packages**
  
NPCs in Riverwood will have new packages distributed via SPID. They will sandbox and do things at the docks. The dragonborn isn't the only one that gets the enjoy these new docks! Some NPCs will visit during the day throughout the week, Gerdur and Sigrid's families will visit the docks in different afternoons, and a group party will be held on Sunday afternoons!
  
  
Packages were also included for NPCs from Expanded Towns and Cities. The will also spend time by the docks and Veekas will even fish at the docks! (More info on this below in the compatibility section)
  
  
There's a total of 25 new packages in the base mod.
  
  
Here is a rough list of all the packages that are given to the NPCs of Riverwood: Spoiler
  
Vanilla Packages:
  

  
* Hod and Gerdur will sit on the bench at the docks and Dorthe, Frodnar, (the two children from ETAC as well if installed) and Stump will sandbox at the docks on Friday Afternoon.
Hod will also pray for a short while at the Talos shrine after they leave the docks.
  
* Sigrid and Alvor will sit on the bench at the docks and Dorthe, Frodnar, (the two children from ETAC as well if installed) and Stump will sandbox at the docks on Saturday Afternoon.
Embry will sandbox by the docks during the day on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.
  
* Faendal will sandbox at the docks around midday on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
Camilla will sandbox at the docks around midday during the weekends.
  
* Sven will sandbox at the docks early in the day during the weekends.
Lucan, Camilla, Faendal, Embry, Sven, Gerdur, Hod, Sigrid, and Alvor will all spend time at the docks on Sunday afternoon.
  

  
ETaC Packages:
  

  
* Basil and Caminda will spend time at docks with Sabir and Myrun on Thursday afternoon.
Odulf and Dynara will spend time at the docks Wednesday afternoon.
  
* Nesbjorn and Rasalie will spend time at the docks Tuesday afternoon.
Brandulf and Isgerder will spend time at docks with Sabir and Myrun on Monday afternoon.
  
* Veekas will work at two different spots throughout the weekdays at 8am for 8 hours.
Veekas will also join the Sunday group in the afternoons.
  
  
  
**Giving Packages to New NPCs**
  
If you want to give a package to a new NPC, whether from a different Riverwood Overhaul or an NPC addon, you can do so through SPID. If you want to give them an existing package from the base mod, you can add a line like this: Package = MissileRiverwoodSundayGroup|<EditorID of NPC>. This will give the NPC the package to sandbox in the afternoon with the group on Sunday. Replace "MissileRiverwoodSundayGroup" with whichever package you want to give them. If you want your NPC to use the fishing markers if [Fishermen Fish](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/134408) is installed, you need to add them to the fishing faction through spid. You can do that like this: Faction = MissileRiverwoodDocksFisherFaction|<EditorID of NPC>. You can also make your own custom packages, which I recommend. Make them in the patch between both mods or add them in a separate plugin if no patch is needed between both mods. You can use the packages I made in the base mod as reference.

**Requirements**
  
This mod doesn't have any hard requirements. This mod will work just on it's own, but it's highly recommended to install these:
  

  
* USSEP as of v1.0.1 - v1 that doesn't require USSEP is in misc files
[Spell Perk Item Distributor (SPID)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869) - New packages won't be distributed without this.
  
* [Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805) - Used for Fishermen Fish integration
[Fishermen Fish](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/134408)﻿ - Has inbuilt integration using BOS. The BOS file will replace some dummy furniture objects with the fishing marker from Fishermen Fish. This is what let's Veekas be able to actually fish from the new docks.
