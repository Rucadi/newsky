====================================
  
**What?**
  
- adds a Khajiit Caravan Trader (Ridzo) to Raven Rock.
  
- Rare Curios NOT required
  
  
  
**Why?**
  
- adds an easy way to buy the 'Rare Curios' CC DLC items, when you're doing a Solstheim/Dragonborn playthrough. 
  
- This was done in a way that does NOT require the use of the 'Rare Curios' CC DLC (Rare Curios not required).
  
  
  
**Where?**
  
- Raven Rock, going up the hill to the right of the Raven Rock Mines
  
  
  
**Formats**
  
**-****ESP Only -** main file version.  Traditional ESP plugin, compatible with SkyrimVR
  
**- ESL flagged ESP** (ESP-FE).  This version will not count towards your plugin limit.  This version has compacted FormIDs, with different FaceGenData, so it is not compatible with the above ESP version.  
  
- You can switch between the 2 versions if you like, but like I said, the ESL-flagged version has new FormIDs (due to compacting).  This mod does not include any scripts, so switching between the 2 shouldn't cause too much harm. 
  
  
  
**Technical**
  
- Ridzo makes use of the CaravanB merchant chests; so any mod that adds items to the Merchant chest will also show up in this mod.
  
- Location:  DLC2RavenRock02 (coc)
  
  
  
**Tidbits**: 
  
- I've been using the ESP version for the last 9 months.  Haven't stumbled across any issues. I finally got around to uploading it to the Nexus.
  
- The ESL Flagged version was created this week.  It should work the same as the ESP version, but it's not as thoroughly playtested.
  
  
  
**Credits**
  
- Bethesda for being awesome
  
- the only new assets added are from the merchant Sign and Facegen data.
