Sewer rats, as the name implies, usually inhabit and breed in the sewers of cities, in addition to invading houses, halls of the dead, prisons, and even sometimes walking carelessly on the streets in the open, with the lower Riften area having a particularly big problem with these animals. Interestingly, they are rarely seen outside of human settlements, due to the presence of larger, more aggressive cousins like Skeevers and Giant Rats in places like catacombs and caves."*

So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
