Mihail's original textures were in old BC3 compression. Most of the diffuse maps were in 4K and the normals in 2K.
  
  
I have cleaned the files of compression artifacts, upscaled the normal maps and the diffuse map for the body skins and cuirass using [chaiNNer](https://github.com/chaiNNer-org) and [ESRGAN models](https://upscale.wiki/wiki/Model_Database) to a max of 8K resolution, and re-compressed all textures in [modern BC7 format](https://www.reedbeta.com/blog/understanding-bcn-texture-compression-formats/) with full mipmaps. I have also downscaled the textures to provide a variety of resolution options.
  
  
In addition, there is an option to select desaturated body skins, with less color. See image to compare.

We know from experience that modding is an extremely addictive past-time and can be a slippery slope from creating a simple load order to porting mods to going full boat and attempting to rebuild Skyrim from the ground up. That's why we believe in a community that integrates Xbox and PC gamers along with porting noobs and experienced mod authors. We all have more to learn, and modding Skyrim to its extreme is a community effort to say the least.
