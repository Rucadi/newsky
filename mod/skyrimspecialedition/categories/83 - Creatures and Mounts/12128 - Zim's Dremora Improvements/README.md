**The aim of this mod is to provide a subtle, balanced, lore-friendly improvement to the Dremora in Skyrim by
  
making them difficult and unique opponents that can rival other deadly foes (such as Draugr, Vampires, Falmer, etc.)
  
without making them overpowered.**
  
  
**New with V2.4: Atronach Forge & Dremora Followers**
  
Create new items and gain permanent Dremora followers with new Atronach Forge recipes
  
implemented to ensure compatibility with other mods and Creation Club content.
  
  
**New Appearance**
  
Dremora now have a variety of appearances, human-like faces (not elf-like) with
  
pointed ears, Oblivion-style eyes, and facial tattoos that vary based on rank.
  
  
**New Stats**
  
Improved strengths, weaknesses, combat styles, stats and perks, all designed to
  
make the Dremora deadly foes without making them over-powered.
  
  
**New Equipment and Spells**
  
New weapons, armor and spells are used by the Dremora.
  
Some can be obtained by the player.
  
The Dremora Merchant has an extended inventory to sell.
  
  
**Requirements and Compatibility**
  
Dragonborn required for V2 (no DLC requirement for earlier versions)
  
No other mods required.
  
Fully compatible with all my mods.
  
May be incompatible with mods that **i)** overhaul dremora, **ii)** provide playable Dremora
  
  
**Special thanks to Badmagic for the Dremora ears, Medtech for the symmetrical Daedric Armor mesh,
  
and navida1 for the Dremora Helmet mesh.**
  
  
  
![](https://i.ibb.co/1Kw5hHx/FORGE.png)
  
**New with V2.4: Atronach Forge recipes**
  
  
All changes to the Atronach Forge are fully compatible with the Creation Club and
  
mods that edit the recipe lists. The Dremora Warrior recipe has been modified.
  
  
**For a list of new [color=#ea9999]Atronach Forge recipes,
  
press the spoiler button below[/color]**
  
  
SpoilerPlease note: all newly added recipes require a Sigil Stone to be placed on the Atronach Forge pedestal.
  
  
![](https://i.ibb.co/NxFh4d6/Recipes.png)
  
  
See the section below for instructions on how to acquire a Xivkyn Heart for the creation of Kynbinder.
  
  
**New with V2.4: Kynbinder**
  
Kynbinder is a unique Daedric staff that can be used
  
to permanently recruit Dremora as followers. It can
  
only be acquired through the Atronach Forge.
  
  
**For info on how to recruit [color=#ea9999]Dremora followers and how to acquire Kynbinder,
  
press the spoiler button below[/color]**
  
  
Spoiler[left]**Dremora followers**
  
To recruit a Dremora follower:
  
1) Obtain Kynbinder (see guide below)
  
2) Find an unbound Dremora (i.e. any Dremora that isn't summoned as part of a Conjuration spell). The simplest place to find unbound Dremora is to summon them at the Atronach Forge, see the recipes list above
  
3) Cast Kynbinder on the Dremora
  
  
Dremora followers are different from regular followers in a few ways:
  
- They do NOT take up the follower slot, so you can have a Dremora follower in addition to your regular follower
  
- You can only have one Dremora follower at a time; recruiting a new Dremora will cause the previous to become hostile
  
- You cannot trade items with Dremora or ask them to do tasks
  
- You can ask a Dremora follower to wait, and they will stay in place until told otherwise (i.e. they won't leave your service or begin following you again if left alone for a long time). There is also some unique dialogue for asking Dremora to guard a player home
  
- You can dismiss a Dremora, at which point they'll turn hostile
  
  
Note: This mod contains no new dialogue for Dremora, who will respond to commands without saying anything.
  
  
**Acquiring Kynbinder**
  
Kynbinder is designed as a late-game reward and is therefore fairly complicated to obtain:
  
1) Increase your Conjuration skill to level 90
  
2) Join the College of Winterhold
  
3) Complete the [Conjuration Ritual Spell](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Conjuration_Ritual_Spell) quest to obtain a Sigil Stone
  
4) Go to [Stillborn Cave](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Stillborn_Cave) and find the corpse of Lucie (see images above)
  
5) Loot Lucie's corpse and retrieve the Xivkyn Heart. You'll also find an Ebony Ore, a Heart Stone and a Broom nearby, all of which are required to obtain Kynbinder
  
6) Find the [Atronach Forge](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Atronach_Forge) in the Midden and add the Sigil Stone to its receptical
  
7) Place the Xivkyn Heart, Ebony Ore (or an Ebony Ingot), Heart Stone and Broom to the offering box and pull the lever. This will cause the Atronach Forge to create Kynbinder[/left]

**New Appearance**
  
All Dremora are identical in vanilla Skyrim, with the same brown
  
horns, black eyes, black hair, elf-shaped face and facial tattoos.
  
  
This mod tries to bring Dremora design closer to TES4: Oblivion.
  
Dremora now have more threatening, human-shaped faces with glowing red eyes and black horns. There's a variety
  
of face shapes / colors and hair shapes / color for every rank, and the highest-level Dremora have unique horns.
  
Facial tattoos now differ to denote rank: the higher the rank, the larger the tattoo.
  
  
Sanguine, previously modelled as a Dremora, now has a unique
  
elf-like appearance to differentiate him from Dremora.
  
  
  
**New Stats**
  
All fighting Dremora, including warriors, mages and
  
archers, have improved stats, equipment and abilities.
  
The Dremora Merchant and Butler offer improved services.

If you're updating this mod mid-playthrough, make sure you unistall the previous version first, make a clean save, and then install the new version.
  
This is the safest way to update and should work without issue, but it's not 100% safe and can break your save, especially if you have lots of mods.
  
The safest option is to only update when starting a new game.
