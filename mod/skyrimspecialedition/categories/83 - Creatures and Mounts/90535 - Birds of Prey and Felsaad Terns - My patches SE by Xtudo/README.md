**Birds of Prey and Felsaad Terns**
  
**My patches by Xtudo**

**Description**
  
A couple of patches for this lovely mod I made for my own game.
  

  
* **2K and 1K optimized textures**. The 1K file is larger because it includes more files that did not need to be optimized in the 2K version.
**No sound patch.**
  
* **USSEP compatible version.** It carries on some Unofficial Patch fixes. [Apothecary](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52130)﻿ version available. It's fine to update mid-game. ESL.
Overwrite if asked.
  

  
**Requirements**
  

  
* [Birds of Prey and Felsaad Terns- Mihail Monsters and Animals (SE-AE version)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90518).
