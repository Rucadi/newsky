# Fluffy House Cats

[font=Georgia]A fluff overhaul for Mihail's House Cats! The cats now use new shell meshes and textures to give them a fluffier, fuzzier appearance. I also added a glowmap for the eyes so that they will glow in the dark. Includes an ESL-flagged plug-in which very mildly increases the size of the cats (0.06 to 0.08).
