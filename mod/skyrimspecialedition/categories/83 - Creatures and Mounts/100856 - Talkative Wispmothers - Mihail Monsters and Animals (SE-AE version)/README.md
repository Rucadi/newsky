[/font][/left][font=Times New Roman]"Talkative Wispmothers" adds 12 new immersive lines of custom dialogue to these mysterious spirits of the wind and frost, making your battles against them more epic, frightening and unique; (check the lines on the video above)
  
  
- [/font][font=Times New Roman]11 of the 12 lines are spoken during combat, as a form of taunt, and the remaining line spoken right after Wispmother rises from the ground, as a kind of magical incantation cast on herself.
  
  
[/font][left][/left][left][font=Times New Roman]- The Pale Lady, the unique Wispmother from the quest "The Pale Lady", is not affected by this mod, because i have other plans for her, to be released as a separated mod.

This mod is compatible with almost all mods that affect Wispmothers in some way, including those that add new sounds to them. The new lines of dialogue are directly attached to the Wispmother's actor entrance, shared by all vanilla Wispmothers, therefore being the most sensible method possible for their application, because if the Wispmother race was used as the method to apply the lines, it would also give dialogue to the Shades projected by the Wispmother, [/font][font=Times New Roman]since they share the same race. Also, creatures that share the vanilla Wispmother voice type won't use the new lines just because they share the vanilla sound effects of the Wispmothers. Besides that, no matter if the new creatures use Wispmother animations, attacks, idles, or whatever, they will not have the Wispmothers' unique lines of dialogue. So you don't need to worry about incompatibilities.[/font][/left][left][font=Times New Roman]
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
