patches also available for a couple of popular mods that add items to levelled lists as they will conflict
  
  
alternative versions available to give Mihail skeletons non-levelled weapons as a fallback if a patch is not available
  
or if you wish to play game with the original mihail skeleton weapons list

A: You have a mod thats adding weapons to skeleton levelled lists and its conflicting with this one,
  
if there isn't a patch available yet use the compatibility version.
  
N.B. not all skeletons will have shields but no weapons? Thats a bug.
  
(except for the ones without arms of course! They're weaponless)
  
*Q: Where is the Ancient Draugr Shields mod SE version? I can't find it!*
  
A: There isn't one you need to [download](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/62602)﻿﻿ the LE version and then resave the .esp from the SSE Creation Kit
  
the included meshes and textures are fine as is but you can run them through CAO if you really want to.
  
*Q: Do I need to use it?*
  
A: No its just a favourite of mine but its not required.
  
  
*Q: How do get [JS Shout Apart Skeletons SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72548)﻿ to work with this/Mihail skeletons in general?*
