[font=Times New Roman]"[/font]Storm Golems are the elite among other electricity-based atronachs. Powerful, they can launch a wide variety of intense lightning attacks, as well as being completely immune to any level of electrical current. They appear to be formed from containing a Storm Atronach through magical bracelets, which force it into a more humanoid form, while causing its power to build up in its core, causing tremendous pressure and preventing it from dissipating, elevating the golem to levels above any other Storm Atronach.
  
  
[font=Times New Roman]Its creation can be executed in many ways and have different origins, but in general the electrified rock form is animated by a daedric spirit. One of the places where they are described as existing in particular concentration is Soul Cairn: they are not particularly welcome by the Ideal Masters, but the intense electrical activity in the skies of the necromancer realm makes this cursed place irresistible to these sons of thunder."

[font=Times New Roman]So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
