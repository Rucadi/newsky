*Complete overhaul of Creation Club's "Goblins" add-on, with new quest integration, improvements and expansion of lore, texts, models, textures, combat and experience in general, making the quest fit the expected quality found in the original game. 
  
  
Works in SE (using "Goblins" creation) and AE.*
  
  
**A comment on my decision to finally touch the Creation Club:** I have never hidden my criticisms towards Creation Club, including the very existence of the concept itself. I have nothing against the existence of patreons, since I even have one, and I am also very grateful to the Nexus Donation Points system, but I am absolutely against paywalled mods and any type of sale of add-ons. I believe that mods should forever be free, and available to everyone, which is another reason for me to be critical of CC, since many people around the world cannot afford to buy a good computer that runs SE/AE, and are automatically excluded from these new add-ons, which can be ported to LE with the greatest of ease. I am even more against it when I see the absolute disregard that Bethesda had when analyzing and approving the content of Creation Club, since its implementation was from the beginning lazy at its core, often breaking the immersion, the already pre-established lore, and basically trying to force as canon things that were simply made just to be made and sold, implemented without the slightest effort to make their development at least a little more immersive. There were no voice actors, there were almost no really new models (most of the new models come from TES: Blades), there were no new animations (which the developers could have easily provided and implemented because they had tools in their possession that were not made available alongside the Creation Kit for us) and much more, there was a lack of love, care and respect for the franchise and the community, something that most of us authors have.
  
  
But, after years of being asked by the community to give my touch on how I think this content should be, and after a productive conversation with the people at Extended Cut, who have already worked their magic with the creation of *"Saints and Seducers Extended Cut"*, I decided to give in, no because I like CC, but exactly because I don't like it, and I think it can be improved, without however changing the basis of each add-on too much, so, the objective is to try to make the best version that I think could have been made and that wasn't in each of them, of course respecting the scope that each add-on deserves to have: for example, I will not make 50 caves for *"Goblins"*, since the purpose of the add-on is only to add a specific clan on a specific cave, so, I will be moderate in this overhaul process. In conclusion, I am willing to recognize the Creation Club and its existence as canonical in the general scenario of my mods and their integration, but only when there is an overhaul carried out by me for each creation, or another overhaul that I consider suitable and well done, such as the one from Extended Cut. 
  
  
I hope you like the overhauls, and support them by endorsing and downloading each one, as well as sharing my mods with people you know.

- The quest *"Blue in the Face"* received new integration: initially you automatically received the quest in the form of the rumor/ initial quest stage *"There are often rumors in Riften of strange creatures coming across the border from Cyrodiil. I should head to the inn and see what information I can find."*, with the following objective marked: *"Look for information at the Bee and Barb"*, which made little sense since the letter that continued the quest was in one of the rooms upstairs and nothing pointed immersively for it (just the quest marker), neither made sense for you to simply enter rooms for rent in search for stuff, and also no one would give you a clue on the place. Then with the Anniversary Edition everything got even worse, now the quest only starts if you find the letter by accident, with absolutely nothing indicating its existence. With my overhaul the letter is no longer in that place, but in a crashed caravan on a small dirt road accessible from the main road that connects Riften and Fort Greenwall *(check image above for location)*. It belonged to Avanessa Calladius, who went in search of the Goblins in Gromm's Pass cave. The letter has now become a journal, mostly rewritten by me *(*check out the differences **[here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/6002)﻿**), with much more added lore and explanations for everything that happened and will happen in the quest, including how she found out about the Goblins and their location. Finding the journal only works as a rumor, marking the place on the map due to the journal mentioning how to get there, something the original version fails to do;

-Now the quest itself has its first stage only when you enter the cave. It should be noted that it was previously possible to skip the first stages by finding the cave by chance, but this skipped much of the mod's background. Therefore, now if you find the cave before reading the journal, there will be a log blocking the passage, intentionally knocked down by the Goblins, with a small passage through which they can pass, but not you. When reading the newspaper, the cave is now accessible, thus forcing you to follow all the steps of proper storytelling. *(on the image above: on the left before reading the journal, on the right after reading it)* I modified the exterior a bit, adding more clutter scattered around and killing the bear guarding the entrance, logically killed by the Goblins for posing a danger. Furthermore, I added the corpse of Clexius, for whom the aforementioned message is intended, to an animal den near Shor's Stone, a location justified by the letter. It's just a detail but it explains why you will never be able to tell him what happened and/or deliver the written message to him;

- The Goblins were problematic, their behavior was similar to that of the Rieklings, but they did not use weapons, and due to their size, larger than humans, they did not match either the animations used or the lore of the creatures. Furthermore, the textures, despite being 2k, had a plastic and lifeless tone, with wrong specularity. (check image above) Furthermore, they were an immersion and lore problem with my Goblins mod ([click here to download it](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/95101)﻿), as they are very different from mine. Now the Goblins of this creation are called Pygmy Goblins, a subspecies native to the caves of the Jerall Mountains, which, due to lack of food and resources in general, suffered a form of "island" dwarfism similar to that of the Rieklings. They now have a similar size to these, even a little smaller, and their own skeleton, with new proportions, such as larger heads. The textures are now in 4k, with improved textures and appropriate speculars, no longer having a plastic appearance. Furthermore, they have tribal paintings just like my common Goblins. Their rarity is also justified, as they are an isolated and little-known subspecies, and therefore they would look strange for the common people when they appear and a special subject of interest for scholars, in contrast to normal Goblins that appear everywhere, also, their reduced size now matches much more with the Riekling animations they use. The clothes and armor are also now retextured in 4k, and the 3 variants (4 with the unique follower) were maintained, just improved in all aspects and made more unique, and renamed as "Pygmy Goblin", as mentioned before; 
  
  
*(on the image bellow: on the left, the original ones with their larger than human size, on the right my new version with a much more matching size, with proportions that fit much better not only with their looks but also their animations and new lore)*

- The sounds they have (probably originating from TES Blades) were kept, as they seem like a more primitive and less sophisticated form of the dialect used by both Rieklings and my Goblins and Riekrs. Furthermore, they now use weapons (in the original version they attacked with their hands in an ugly and clumsy movement, especially with their original size): the weapons are 4k retextured versions of the Riekling Spears, called Goblin Spears, and they also feature tribal paintings and rust. The throwable version is also present and is used by one of the variants, but both are undroppable. These weapons, however, have lower damage than the Rieklings. Furthermore, the level of Pygmy Goblins went from level 6 to being leveled between 4 and 10, but with lower stats. *(on the image bellow, the 2 variants of Goblin Spears used by them)

- Gogh, the Goblin hunter and follower is now also leveled, between 6 and 15, and slightly higher stats. The "Spear of Bitter Mercy" used by him is now called "Gogh's Spear of Bitter Mercy", as there are numerous in the lore, and was retextured by me to a dirtier and more damaged version. Additionally, the new 4k texture has proper specularity, with non-metallic parts no longer shining like metal, and no more looking plastic. The spear is also not droppable, just as it is not in the original version. In addition to summoning a Storm Atronach as originally on the creation and as in Morrowind, it now also causes electrical damage as in ESO, dealing 20 points of shock damage to the enemy. I added daedric weapon keywords, as it is an artifact of Hircine, so Vigilants of Stendarr may become aggressive when they see this Goblin;

- The Orc "Blue God" now can level between 5 and 20, and no longer 5 and 60, since in the lore he is not exactly a strong Orc, so, there is no point in such a possible high level. Additionally, I retextured the "Goblin Totem Staff" to 4k and adjusted the speculars because it also had a plastic look. The staff continues to be droppable and can still be obtained from his corpse and also occasionally purchased from Khajiit caravans. The Orc's newspaper, "Blue God's Journal", also underwent edits and new text (check the changes **[here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/6002)﻿**), and I retextured its model for 4k;
  
  
*(on the image bellow: the "Blue God" and the overhauled staff)

- Gromm's Pass now has 2 to 3 times more Goblins, and now they respawn, that is, even after killing the Orc, you can still find the Pygmy Goblins there. They can only be found on that location, since I removed 3 extra spawn points that the creation added of Goblins attacking near the borders, due to the fact that I will soon place some border posts from other provinces there, and you already have numerous small camps near the roads in my Goblin mod, with much better organized attacks, both technically from the point of view of implementation as in immersive terms from the player's in-game point of view.
  
Some Goblins inside the cave can now be seen prostrate worshiping the Orc, adding an extra touch to the experience;
  
  
*(on the image bellow: despite the fact the small Pygmy Goblins on the left can only be found on the specific cave, coming from the cave systems of Jerall Mountains, you can still find the common Goblins on the right in pretty much all south Skyrim with my standalone Goblins mod)*

- The new clutter added by the mod, namely braziers, cauldrons and bones was also retextured to 4k, but the Riekling clutter reused by the creation was not, as it uses the same object entry in the CK used by the Rieklings' clutter and I don't want to touch it right now. The new ingredient, Steel-Blue Entoloma, has also been retextured for 4k. *(on the image bellow, the new clutter and ingredient re-textured to 4k)

*The mod is not compatible with most other mods that modify the CC's creation "Goblins" and its added items, quest stages, locations, creatures, weapons and more. If you have one installed, or think you might have one, put this mod below it/them in your load order. If you are asked about files overwriting those of other mods, press "Yes to all".*(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
