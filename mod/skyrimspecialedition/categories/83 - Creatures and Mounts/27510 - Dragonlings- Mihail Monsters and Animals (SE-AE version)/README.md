*"Dragonlings are purple-colored winged reptiles that resemble small dragons and attack by breathing small fireballs at their enemies.**It is a consensus that despite belonging to the draconid family that includes the Drakes, the Dracolizards, among others, they do not have any direct relationship with the Dovah. Legends that considered Dragonlings as the infant form of Dragons are nothing more than fairy tales, as the Dovah do not reproduce by conventional means, thus not producing traditional offspring. Dragonlings live primarily in the area around Illiac Bay, but can also be found in other provinces, occurring widely in Skyrim in the Reach region.
  
  
Aggressive, their main form of attack is a weak fire breath, but they can be calmed by people capable of speaking a dialect of Dragonish, a group of draconic languages ​​that have been lost in time since ages past, which makes it difficult to establish a dialogue nowadays, but also makes it clear that Dragonlings possess some degree of sentience, like most of their cousins.
  
  
Some Imps with satisfactory alteration and/or illusion abilities have been known to transform into small dragons, either for simple fun or to intimidate predators and ward off threats. Despite this, when transformed, they look like miniature versions of common Dragons, and not like Dragonlings, which have physical characteristics quite distinguishable from other draconian beasts, but transformed Imps can doubtless fool an unsuspecting observer, who will believe he has spotted the small flying purple reptile."*

So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.

[Phiit-](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/users/128339)﻿ since the Dragonlings use the animated object skeleton of the vanilla Hawks, attached via script to a skeleton of an actor creature, I used the most complex set of Hawk animations made by Phiit as a base to animate the model, thus giving animation to the neck, head and tail, since the vanilla Hawk animations only move the wings;
