**! ! ! [INFAMOUS ICE WRAITHS LEGENDARY EDITION](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/99783?tab=description&BH=3)﻿ ! ! !****[ [ [ MOD DESCRIPTION ] ] ]**
  
  
**If you're like me and have been disappointed with the vanilla Ice Wraiths, then this mod is for you. Skyrim's Ice Wraiths have the proportions of a giant tadpole****. This mod replaces the vanilla Ice Wraith's skeleton with a new custom skeleton meant to give the Ice Wraiths of Skyrim a more dramatic and serpent-like appearance.  Working within the confines of the vanilla mesh, I enhanced the body and tail of Skyrim's Ice Wraiths to give them a far more intimidating****appearance****!  These new subtle changes to Skyrim's Ice Wraiths have transformed them into fantastic magical ice****serpents that could rip a man apart.  Now you can enjoy encountering these impressive man-eating serpents throughout the province of Skyrim, immersing you even more into the word of Skyrim with every encounter!****! ! ! SEEING IS BELIEVING ! ! !

**[ [ [ MOD COMPATIBILITY ] ] ]****Infamous Ice Wraiths uses a custom skeleton for the Vanilla Ice Wraiths and will overwrite any mod that makes changes to the vanilla Ice Wraith skeleton.
  
 
  
Mods that make sweeping changes to vanilla skeletons e.g."Realistic Ragdoll and Force"****should be compatible as long as "Infamous Ice Wraiths" is installed after those mods and allowed to overwrite their files.**
  
  
**Should be fully compatible with any texture mods, since this mod contains no textures of it's own only a skeleton.  Which also makes it compatible with most other creature mods that do not edit vanilla skeletons.****[ [ [ INSTALLATION ] ] ]****Recommend using Vortex or your favorite mod manager.****Install "Infamous Ice Wraiths" after any mod that makes changes to the vanilla Ice Wraiths and Overwrite any files when prompted to.
  
  
 There is no ".esp plugin" with this mod!****[ [ [ MY OTHER MODS ] ] ]****If you like this mod then I'm sure you'll enjoy my other mods as well.
