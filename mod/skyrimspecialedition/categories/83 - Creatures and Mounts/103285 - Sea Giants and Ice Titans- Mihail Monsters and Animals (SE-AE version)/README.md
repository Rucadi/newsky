*Both of these gigantic races that inspired some of the most terrifying sailor stories are now compiled in one mod. The shores of Skyrim will become a dangerous place to cross, even for the bravest pirate.*
  
From Sea Giants page:
  
[/font][font=Times New Roman][/font][font=Times New Roman]*"**The Sea Giants are a mysterious and little-understood race of seafaring giants, who tirelessly engage in piracy in the Sea of Ghosts region, sailing their large ships decorated with giant bones and totems. The Sea Giants origin is as unknown as its culture and beliefs, but its motives are clear, they plunder and overpower the weakest, which denotes a ruthless and violent culture. They are also known as skilled whalers.**Although they generally only act as looters, some have already shown interest in territorial expansions, trying to dominate areas of Skyrim in the past, but without success. They are part of the legends of all the people of the regions close to the north coast, and it is generally said that they only disembark on dry land in the coldest winters, and never stay for long, just looting and killing everything they find in front of them, and soon then disappearing among the fog and glaciers of the frozen ocean, until the arrival of a new winter, or several after. This, however, proved to be false several times, with the Sea Giants docking their ships in Skyrim and nearby islands and establishing camps, from which they set out on raids regularly, and even though every now and then one ship departed, another arrived. Still, given the rarity and remote locations they chose, it is natural for the Norse to think that they only appeared sporadically, and then left, after looting everything they could.*
  
[/font]*[font=Times New Roman]No one knows where these Sea Giant tribes live, they are believed to be on the northern islands, between Atmora and Tamriel, and several of those exist and are very little explored, like Roscrea for example. It is also not known if they live in just one island, or are spread across several, some speculate that they do not even have a fixed community, but rather that they live most of the time on their ships. It is known, however, that they are naturally close cousins of the Giants that inhabit the continent and the Norse themselves. As is well known, all Nords and Giants descend from the ancient Atmorans, a mythical and extremely powerful people who inhabited the now supposedly empty and frozen continent to the north. It is speculated that there were several types of Atmorans, which would have originated several different descendants, but it is known that in general they were similar to humans of high stature and power, with some being described as larger than mountains. Whether this is an exaggeration, or a frightening fact lost to time, no one can say today, but several waves of Atmorans migrated to Skyrim over the millennia, and not all were of the same stature. What is known is that at a certain and mysterious time, the Atmorans in Skyrim were divided between Giants and Norse, with the Giants retaining their great size and strength, but apparently less intelligence and magical abilities, and the Norse people losing much of that stature and impressive physical power, but maintaining their intelligence and magical abilities. This, however, does not seem to have happened with the Sea Giants, as they maintain all the positive attributes of both: they retained high intelligence and incredible magical abilities, associated with tall stature and physical strength. They are the perfect combination of a Nord and a Giant, and the closest thing we can find to a legendary Atmoran warrior, with their blue-gray skin covered in white tribal paints, strong red beards and hair, although some are seen with white or blond beards and hair as well, slender but strong bodies, with long limbs ending in large powerful hands and feet, and their armor made of leather, fur and magical ice, decorated with the bones of their victims.
  
  
They're skilled forgers of Stalhrim, the magical and mysterious ice that the ancient Atmorans manipulated for the creation of resistant and powerful ice armor and weapons, a knowledge that today among the Norse is mostly limited to the Skaal tribe. The Sea Giants, however, maintained this knowledge, crafting and enchanting their equipment with powerful offensive and defensive ice spells. They are also known to tame Snowrays and Grahls, which often appear as their pets when found in icy caves that they use as hiding places.
  
  
Sea Giants are usually accompanied by their smaller kin, although still much taller than a Nord, and who seem to have equal respect and place in their society as a pure Sea Giant, although these last ones are usually those seen in a position of high command. Known as Half-Giants, they are hybrids of Sea Giants and Nords. Slavers, the Sea Giants often take female prisoners during their raids, which they take to their camps for unknown purposes besides the confirmed goal of reproduction. Belonging to the same evolutionary line, and very close within it, it is known that Giants and Nords can “easily” procreate with each other, giving rise to Half-Giants, with a height approximately intermediate between both races, and great physical power. Scholars believe that the Sea Giants only intend to increase their numbers, perhaps due to the scarcity of female Sea Giants, as they are not commonly seen. The hypothesis of the simple production of slaves has no strength since these Half-Giants were never observed in the condition of slavery, but rather as active members of the Sea Giant society, although generally in hierarchical positions of less power, which is understandable in a society who values power and strength above all else. They have been called “howling half-kin” by some scholars and warriors who have had the displeasure of encountering them, for their habit of screaming gutturally in combat during their looting."

Extra info: [/font][font=Times New Roman]Despite being a recent novelty, the universe of the Sea Giants has been previously painted in little-known past games, such as the case of TES Travels: Dawnstar and TES Travels: Shadowkey, with the appearance of the Ice Tribes, clearly tribes of Half-(Sea) Giants.[/font][font=Times New Roman]
  
  
  
  
From Ice Titans page:
  
  
[/font][font=Times New Roman]*"**The Ice Jötun, or simply Ice Titan, is one of the now rarely seen, and almost mythological Titan breeds. He has blue skin, an ugly, deformed face covered in warts, and long snow-covered hair and beard. The body is robust and wrinkled, and the arms are long and end in large hands. The feet are also powerful, being able to crush a bear with a single stomp.
  
  
The**Jötnar, or their singular Jötun, are powerful primitive giant sentient beings with brutal elemental magical powers. A Titan resembles a man in many ways, but is ugly like a Troll and taller than a tree. Although a Titan appears capable of reasoning, all attempts to communicate with them to date have ended the same way, in a quick and painful death. This large and strong family generally inhabits mountains, is capable of making simple armor and using heavy weapons. The armor of an Ice Titan is made of animal fur, leather, bones and ropes, as well as metal parts removed from ships, and it wields generally heavy iron anchors, which it uses as weapons to crush enemies, and which the Titan collects from shipwrecks, many of them created by the Titan itself.*[/font][font=Times New Roman]*The Ice Titans are capable of creating ice storms, and myths say that in the past, when they were more common, Titans traveled to the coast to wreck ships with their powerful torments, and then ate the corpses of sailors. It may be a myth, but as they use armor and weapons made from carved bones and ship parts, the myth can be very real. Also, their name "Jötun" means, according to some questionable sources, something related to “voracious” or “gluttonous”, in a lost language of Atmora .*[/font][font=Times New Roman][/font][font=Times New Roman]*They are one of the ancient races of Skyrim, with origin lost in time, alongside the Bolgans and several others, most of them very scarce these days, and were considered a threat by both the powerful ancient Elves and Atmorans, and both created raids to decimate them, killing most of the Titans and forcing the survivors to retreat to the distant mountains. Perhaps this fact justifies the hatred that all Titans have for men and mer, or perhaps they are simply extremely angry beings, with no special reason to that, and perhaps even deeply degenerate and stupid.*[/font][font=Times New Roman][/font][font=Times New Roman]*Despite this, most scholars believe that although the ancient Atmorans described the presence of the Titans in Skyrim when they arrived, and their overwhelming confrontations with them, in fact the Titans are likely descendants of an even older lineage of Atmorans that would have reached Skyrim before the beginning of the best-known Atmoran colonizations, and became what would come to be known as Titans, since, with the necessary differences, they closely resemble men and Giants, being probably a degenerate line of ancient waves of Atmoran immigration.*[/font][font=Times New Roman]*In fact, in the 4th Age only a few of them are still alive, making many people believe that they are just a myth, while most scholars believe that they have become extinct. But, anyone who often travels through the remote snowy mountains knows that they are very real and one of the greatest dangers in Skyrim.*[/font][font=Times New Roman]*Titans are solitary creatures and highly aggressive towards other beings, however there are ancient reports of Ice Titans taming Frost Trolls.*[/font][font=Times New Roman]*In their little-known language, they refer to their place of origin as Jötunheim, therefore not considering themselves natives of Skyrim. Such communications were, however, only possible in ancient times, and was made by powerful magicians who kept the Titans under strong illusion spells, to keep them calm during interviews that honestly never got anywhere, given their very limited vocabulary and intellectual capacity.**"*[/font][font=Times New Roman]

So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
