[font=Times New Roman][left]*"Daedroths are large bipedal daedra of crocodilian appearance and remarkable ferocity, who display considerable intelligence despite their bestial aspect. Mainly found in the service of Molag Bal and Mehrunes Dagon, these daedra can manifest in different shapes and sizes according to their status, but always as formidable foes.
  
  
With a body heavily protected by thick scaly plates, what stands out most about their bulky bodies are their long claws and large mouths full of sharp teeth. Daedroths, however, do not tend to use their powerful bite very often, out of pride in their own status as intelligent daedra, and seeking to be seen and accepted by other higher clans as their equals rather than animalized beasts. In combat, they often make use of their sharp claws, as well as spit fire from their mouths.
  
  
Initially all Daedroths were similar in appearance, larger than an Altmer, and much more muscular, with spikes covering their heads, backs, and tails, with their color varying according to the plane of Oblivion they inhabited. They were able to breathe fireballs in combat and their claws held a weak venom, believed to be from living in nefarious swamps. Some with more important functions wore armor, being generals of battalions of other daedras. Even though it is a common variant to this day, however, this family has branched out due to the events of Planemeld.
  
  
Molag employed several of his most trusted Daedroths as high-ranking leaders of contingents of creatures of Oblivion, and aimed to protect the Dark Anchors with them, essential in the process of the Prince of Coldharbour's invasion and kidnapping of Nirn. Among them were Molag's favorite Daedroths, Menta Na and Hrelvesuu, and both failed in their quests, along with so many others, and were punished by Molag himself, to become what would come to be known as the Lesser Daedroths. The Lesser Daedroths would now bear in their physical form the shame of their flaws: of human stature, a body far less muscular than their former vessels, with pathetic claws and teeth compared to their original forms, these Daedroths have had their pride offended, and many have found ways to be summoned permanently to Nirn and leave their home realm, to avoid suffering the constant humiliation of having been demoted to a state of existence they deem inferior. Menta Na and Hrevelsuu specifically were later located and killed by Nerevarine, who returned them to their master's enraged clutches.
  
  
These Lesser Daedroths resort not only to weapons, but some also to minor shock abilities, apparently no longer possessing the ability to breathe fire, or effectively defend themselves with their bare clawed hands. It is also important to mention that with the emergence of the Lesser Daedroth species, their original form came to be referred to as Grand Daedroths.
  
  
In return, those who were most successful were also transformed, but into a superior and even more terrifying form known as the Daedroth Titans. Ranging in sizes from slightly larger than an ordinary Daedroth to sizes that are only surpassed by a Daedric Titan or similar abomination, these Daedroths, rewarded for their success and allegiance to Molag Bal, have a more bestialized appearance, and far greater destructive magical potency, being able to produce breaths of fire that surpass even some dragons, in addition to being protected by thick heavy armor plates in the style forged by the Dremora Clan.
  
  
Dagon, not surprisingly, copied the punishment and reward model for his own Daedroths, as he had done with the Daedric Titans previously, having especially employed the Daedroth Titans in the invasion of Nirn during the Oblivion Crisis.
  
  
Linguists will point out that "Daedroth" is also the proper singular form of "Daedra", but for the mentioned crocodilian creatures the common use of the name is the word "Daedroth" for the singular and the word "Daedroths" for the plural. The term "Lesser Daedra" is sometimes used to define a group of Lesser Daedroths, due to this confusion, but it is generally accepted that the most correct plural to use is "Lesser Daedroths", with "Lesser Daedra" being used for define a group of any lower-ranking daedra type. It is also worth mentioning that to avoid further confusion, many scholars in general and linguists in particular began to use the term "Daedra" to refer to the singular of the inhabitants of Oblivion, and "Daedras" to the plural, then definitively removing the term "Daedroth", limiting it only to the specific reptilian daedra, but it clearly depends from author to author."*[/left][left]**by Beastmaster Mihail \***

A former monster hunter, now a dedicated scholar, he is planned to be released as an NPC in late 2022/early 2023, doing the same job in-game as my descriptions do on Nexus.)
  
  
  
**Technical info:** Spell Tomes to summon all the variants can be randomly purchased from spell vendors, found randomly in mage lairs and similar places, or looted from random conjurers.

(Coldharbour) Dread Grand Daedroth, (Deadlands) Daedroth Titan, (Coldharbour) Daedroth Titan,

- 9 new spells to conjure 9 of the mentioned Daedroth variants (minus the Coldharbour Daedroth Titan);
  
  
- 3 new ingredients: Lesser Daedroth Teeth, Grand Daedroth Teeth and Daedroth Titan Teeth;
  
  
- [/font][font=Times New Roman]The value of Sigil Stones (dropped sometimes by Daedroth Titans) has gone from *"0"* to *"2000"*. It was
  
always absurd that they have no value at all in the vanilla game, so this change corrects a major loric issue.[/font][font=Times New Roman]

So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
