For this mod I have hand placed every fairy, and I will be keeping the number of fairies to a more modest level (less than 250), to ensure the best performance. 
  
  
The latest update adds more fairy variety. There are now pink fairies which are a little less common than blue fairies, and there are also green fairies that are a more rare to find.
  
  
I have also provided a Lite Edition as an option for those who would prefer to have a lot less fairies in the wild. The light edition features more concentration of fairies around magical areas such as the elder gleam, fairy ring, and ancestral glade.
  
  
  
A Reduced Glow version by Wired1up is also available: [Here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/112026)

Note: This mod is a complete remake of a mod from 2014. It is not a port. The 2014 mod replaced bug spawners and caused issues with uninstallations. In this mod I have placed each fairy by hand, so there is no such issues.[/font]
