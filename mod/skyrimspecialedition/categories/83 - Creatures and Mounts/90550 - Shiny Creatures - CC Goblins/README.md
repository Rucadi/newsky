- Author: TheShiningAbsol
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90550


Requires [Shiny Creatures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17845) and the **Goblins** Creation!

Goblins are now able to potentially spawn shiny.
  
  
Gogh has an increased chance of being shiny.
  
  
Will drop a unique and valuable item just as shinies in the original mod do.
  
  
Color inspired by [Bokoblins](https://www.zeldadungeon.net/wiki/images/8/80/BotW_Bokoblin.png)﻿ from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.
  
  
I recommend a mod such as [Goblins Around Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36526) for more opportunities to find one.﻿
  
  
Flagged as ESL.﻿

Please see the [Shiny Creatures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17845)﻿ page for more information if you're confused as to what any of this means.
  
  
I also recommend [Simply Tame](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26490) as an excellent companion mod to Shiny Creatures if you'd like to "catch" shinies rather than just kill them for a trophy.﻿
  
  
Expect more Shiny Creatures patches in the future.
