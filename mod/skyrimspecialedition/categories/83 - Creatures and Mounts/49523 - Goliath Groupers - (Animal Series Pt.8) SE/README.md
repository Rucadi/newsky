[font=Comic Sans MS]Goliath Groupers are large predatory fish and one of the largest species of grouper fish that weigh up to 800lbs. They're often found in warmer water, but some have adapted to the cold saltwaters of Skyrim and thus they can found in Skyrim as well as Solstheim. Fishermen sometimes fish for groupers as they yield a large amount of meat, but they're rarer than tuna and much more expensive, only nobles and kings can afford to have grouper as a frequent dish.
  
  
Goliath Groupers come in 5 variants and each variant drops scales that are alchemically different from the others.
