*"*[/font][font=Times New Roman]*Wampas are giant carnivorous predatory reptomammals native to the remote icy continent of Atmora. The bipedal beasts stand up to 3 meters tall and weigh more than 200 kilograms, and are covered in shaggy white fur, constantly stained with the blood of killed prey. Wampas have long, powerful arms and sharp, deadly claws capable of carving layers of ice, and mouths armed with jagged yellow teeth. Primarily solitary hunters, Wampas occasionally hunt in packs, preferring to ambush their prey under the camouflage of snowbanks and blizzards. Stunned victims are taken back to the creatures' lairs, usually large ice caves, where the Wampas store food, keeping the prey alive, usually hanging by their legs from the ice roofs of their homes. These poor victims, still alive and hanging, are generally also used as toys by Wampa cubs.
  
  
 Aided by a keen sense of smell and a thick, well-camouflaged coat, carnivorous Wampas roam the icy plains of Skyrim attacking almost defenseless animals such as Horkers, Deer and Tauntauns, the latter also a species that migrated from Atmora, and one of the few prey that Wampas had on the now frozen-dead continent. They began migrating to the north of Skyrim since ancient and untold times, when sea levels fell between Atmora and Tamriel, creating ice bridges crossing the Sea of ​​Ghosts, which temporarily connected the two continents. They arrived with the first Atmorans, and alongside many other creatures from the bizarre fauna of that icy continent, and had an immediate impact on the local fauna, for example almost driving the Grahl to extinction.
  
  
A single powerful blow from a Wampa's clawed paw is enough to neutralize large prey, and very rarely do Wampas themselves fall prey to predators. In fact, the creatures have no natural enemies except for other Wampas, human hunters, an occasional colossal Atmoran Eagle, and the Giants, as they occasionally hunt their Mammoths in packs.
  
  
The creatures chase their prey until they get close enough to make a quick attack. A Wampa would last sight its target by rearing up on its hind legs and then leaping forward in a deadly attack with its claws extended. After this, the Wampa will drag its prey back to its ice cave, hang it upside down from the ice ceiling, and devour parts of the prey whenever necessary, often gradually, and often keeping it alive in the process.
  
  
You will commonly find Wampas living alone or in pairs or trios, inside ice caves or hunting on snowy plains, always in remote regions. Wampas are a valuable hunting trophy, and you will find mounted Wampa heads inside some houses in the regions where they occur, with these mounted trophies considered signs of bravery.
  
  
Wampas have little or no visible culture, but have been seen devising complex group hunting strategies to capture prey in ice mazes, or hiding around Dwarven ruins to ambush looters and researchers trying to establish camps there. Alpha Wampas are especially old and ferocious Wampas who coordinate small gangs, and wear ornaments made of bloody bones around their necks, denoting some type of semi-sentience and understanding of symbolism.
  
  
Primitive, they were created at the dawn of Nirn, when the classes of animals were not yet completely differentiated and established. Considered reptomammals, this classification includes any species with reptilian and mammalian characteristics, such as having scaly skin but having fur on top for warmth. Giving birth to live young is another common trait, and when they reproduce through eggs, like reptiles, they produce milk from mammary glands, unlike members of the reptile class. They are almost exclusively warm-blooded, an attribute that differentiates them from viviparous reptiles that also give birth to live young. In the case of Wampas, their fur-covered body is covered in thick, tough scaly skin, like the skin of a reptile, making them a living tank.*[/font][font=Times New Roman]*"***by Beastmaster Mihail \***

(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
