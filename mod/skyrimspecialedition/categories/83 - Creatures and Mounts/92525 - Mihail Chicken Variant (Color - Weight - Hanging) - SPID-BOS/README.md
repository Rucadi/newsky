A replacer for chicken that allows to finally have fat and thin chicken with different colors, all at the same time! 
  
Support for Hanging Dead Chicken is also included.
  
  
**About the mod:**
  
Mihail Chicken Variant (Color - Weight - Hanging) - SPID-BOS is a mod that finally adds full diversity to the chicken in Skyrim. Now you will encounter different textured chicken, as well as fat chicken and support for hanged chicken is also added through SPID and BOS.
  
The diverse options are randomly distributed around the world. You can edit those values through the ini files, or using the options in the Fomod included.
  
  
The new fat chicken models are optimized and edited versions of Mihail's base ones by me.
  
  
  
**Installation:**
  
Download the file and install it through your mod manager as a regular mod. Fomod is included, so all options are chosen here. The plugins are load order agnosic, but it is recommended to sort them using LOOT
  
  
You can configure the chance of spawning in the fomod, or ingame, using the following command:
  
  
set ChanceForFatChicken to  x
  
  
Where "x" is the percentage you want. The modifications are permanent.

This mod is incompatible with any mod that changes model or textures of the chicken, like:
