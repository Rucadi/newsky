**Some adjustments for Chaos Dragon Mod**（This mod is ESL marked, no need to take up precious ESP slot）
  
[line]**Drop Adjustments**

  
* **Unique Dragon Drops**[list]
Unique dragons now drop **Unique Dragon Scales and Dragon Bones +2** (for crafting loot or collecting, having more is never a bad thing).
  
* Unique dragons also drop **Normal Dragon Scales and Dragon Bones** (no more waiting for wild dragons to come around to gather the necessary materials for crafting dragon bone gear and weapons).

  
[/list][line]**Equipment Adjustments**

  
* Restored the unused **melee damage reflection effect** for the full set of **Unknown Steel Armor**, and increased its value.
Increased the values of the **Red Dragon Armor** set.
  
* **Berserk Helmet** enchantment adjustments:[list]
**Melee damage increased by 200%**, but **damage taken increased by 100%**, and **magic resistance decreased by 100%**.
  

  
[\*]**Brute Helmet** enchantment adjustments:

  
* **One-handed and two-handed weapon damage increased by 75%**, but **heavy attacks consume 40% more stamina**.

  
[\*]**Crystal Shield and Red Crystal Shield** now have a **mana cost of 30 per second**.
  
[\*]**Wind Boots** movement speed increase reduced to **30%**.
  
[\*]**Black Mask** increases **mana by 400**, but reduces **health and stamina by 200** each.
  
[\*]**Whirlwind Amulet** now causes **imbalance** when touching enemies, instead of knocking them down.
  
[\*]**Command Daedra Circlet** range reduced to **50 yards**.
  
[\*]**Twin Dragonscale Armor** value increased.
  
[\*]**Unique Dragon Scale**Amulet enchantment values increased.
  
[\*]**Sahloknir, Krosulhahs Mask** values increased, and their enchantments have been modified.
  
[\*]**Dragon Lord Crown** value increased, and the summoned dragons have become more complete (inheriting the original dragon's unique abilities).
  
[\*]**Enhanced Miraak Mask** value increased, and summoned **Apocrypha Dragons** have become more complete (inheriting the original dragon's unique abilities).
  
[/list][line]**Weapon Adjustments**

  
* **Dark Blade** now includes an enchantment. It was originally without enchantment, which seemed unreasonable, so I added one:[list]
Causes **<15> points of unresistable damage**, with **<30%>** chance to release **Dark Explosion** on heavy attacks.
  

  
[\*]**Whitehorn Dragon Longsword** now includes an enchantment:

  
* Deals **<30> points of frost damage** per second for **<2> seconds**, with **<30%>** chance to release **Frost Explosion** on heavy attacks.

  
[\*]**Curse Dragon Greatsword** value increased.
  
[\*]**Jaggy Sword** value increased.
  
[\*]**Poison Tooth Dagger** value increased.
  
[\*]**Chaos Blade** now causes **fire, frost, shock, poison, and disease damage**.
  
[\*]**Infected Bone Axe** value increased.
  
[\*]**Strong Dragonbone Warhammer** enchantment mechanism adjusted:

  
* When stamina is below **30%**, powerful attacks have **30%** chance to knock down the target.

  
[\*]**Magnetic Mace** now deals additional damage and **slows down Dwemer Automaton units**.
  
[\*]**Evil Dragon Greatsword** value increased.
  
[\*]**Super Infected Bone Axe** value increased.
  
[\*]**Venomous Fang Dagger** value increased.
  
[\*]**Crimson Bow** value increased.
  
[/list][line]**NIF Effect Adjustments**

  
* All **Dragon Breath** NIFs have been upgraded, based on **[KittyVFX - Dragon Breath](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/118431?tab=description)﻿** for better visual effects. A big thank Kitty to the amazing work!
Other effects (FX) have also been properly adjusted to better match the dragons' appearance and style.
  

[line]**World Adjustments**

  
* Added a small light source to the **Hidden Tomb** to make it less dark.
Replaced the **Apocrypha Water** in the **Nightmare World** .
  

[line]**Dragon Adjustments**

  
* **Alduin’s Final** has been strengthened. When its health drops to **30%**, it enters the **second phase**:
    
  [list]
**1000 Armor**, **10,000 health** increased, magic resistance and melee damage scaling increased.
  
* All attacks deal massive **unresistable true damage**.
The second phase now feels much more pronounced.
  

  
[\*]**Xenomorph Dragon** has been renamed to **Blackness Dragon**. While the Xenomorph design was interesting, it didn't quite belong in Skyrim, so I made some small adjustments.
  

  
* No changes to its abilities, just the appearance and name.
**Queen Xenomorph Dragon** can now summon **two Xenomorph Dragons**.
  

  
[\*]Several dragons have had their abilities improved, with effects updated to better match their appearance. For example:
  

  
* **Viinturuth** now breathes a **red lightning storm** instead of a regular lightning storm.

  
[\*]**Aetherial Dragon** now has its own skeleton (from the vanilla). Many skeleton replacements would break this model and cause parts of it to float.
  
[\*]The roar sound of the summoned **Spirit Dragon** has been removed from the action band, otherwise it would be too noisy, so DAR or OAR is required.
  
[/list]

  
  

[line]**Model Fixes**

  
* Fixed the **Dwemer parts** of **Vulthuryol** and the strange purple light issue with **Aetherial Dragon**.
Fixed the issue where **Aetherial Spider** had no metallic reflections.
  
* Fixed the armor parts of **Armored Dragon** not reflecting properly.

[line]**Installation & Uninstallation****I**

  
* Installation: Use a mod manager to install,
Uninstallation: Use a mod manager to uninstall.
  

[line]**Compatibility**

  
* Compatible with most mods.
If you are using other mods that modify the **Chaos Dragon Mod**, ensure this mod is loaded **after** them to avoid conflicts.

That's all for now
  
If there are other areas you think could be improved, please discuss in the comments and I'll see what I can do.
