Alduin, after devouring countless fallen heroes in Sovngarde formed, within himself,
  
an amalgamation of souls to serve as a champion against you, the dragonborn.

You'll find its corpse around the corner on the Throat of the World, facing west.
  
Alduin will also summon a version of it during its boss fight.

I recommend playing up to the final mainline quest, just to reach the Hall of Valor, there you will find a *weapon* that will briefly weaken it during the battle.
  
Beware though, as striking it more than once consecutively with said weapon will actively power it up.
  
  
Avoid any bash attacks as they are designed to knock you back quite a distance.
  
  
Bring some friends, if you don't want to get outnumbered as he will summon three different elemental atronachs at a time.
  
Bringing followers along will allow you to divert their aggression.
  
  
Despite using mainly Melee weapons, it has many ranged options as its attacks launch arcs of golden fire.
  
It also uses a Bow with arrows that explode on contact.
  
  
It also has various options for Area Of Effect damage such as a giant vortex of flame that persists in one location,
  
for these reasons I recommend keeping a safe distance and biding your time until he's vulnerable, such as after a slow power attack.

You get a sword that let's you become anime.
