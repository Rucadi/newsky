* [size=4]*If you use, like and value my work, please consider giving an endorsement. I've worked hard for years to offer you the best of me for free, and the only thing I ask in return is this gesture, which increases my relevance and engagement on Nexus, and motivates me to continue;*
  
*I do not inspect or have any influence over translations of my mods (including those linked directly on my pages), nor do I have any power over patches or add-ons made to my content. So, before using any unofficial add-ons for my mods, make sure they conform to the latest version of my official release, and never use these if they don't. The same applies to Xbox ports;*

Due to their simple and small structure and because they are materialized in Nirn from residual fragments of Chaotic Creatia, these insects tend to be stuck in the place they invade, not returning to Oblivion when the spellcaster runs out of magic, and although they can end up accumulating in large numbers, they do not cause any real damage to the places they infest.
  
  
Despite their 3 pairs of sharp jaws and a possibly poisonous stinger, these insects mostly use them only to prey on small rodents, or to defend themselves from these rodents larger cousins, such as giant rats or skeevers. They seem to feel a special affinity for places where people are tortured, or even areas where a dense energy of sadness and depression hangs in the air, and according to scholars they feed mostly on the thought-forms that these emotions generate, being actually considered by many as useful vehicles for cleaning these mental forms.
  
  
Due to this attraction to suffering, they are an invasive species in Soul Cairn in large numbers, and tend to accumulate especially around soul fissures. In Nirn they occur widely in warlock lairs, but they also can often be found in necromancer and vampire hideouts, and Hagraven nests."

So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
