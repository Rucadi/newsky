![](https://i.imgur.com/PwJxVUw.png)[/font][font=Times New Roman][/font][font=Times New Roman]*When Ithelia, the Mistress of the Untraveled Road, returned in 2E 582, the veil between Mirrormoor and Fargrave (a lost fragmented shard of Mirrormor) fractured once more. Many Daedra and Atronachs who had long dwelled in Fargrave, oblivious of their true origins, were reshaped by her reawakening. Their forms were again covered in fragmented crystalline glass, their vestiges rewritten, alignment altered, and powers transformed, as they reverted to what they once had been: servants of Ithelia, restored to their original vestigial essence.*[/font][font=Times New Roman]*Among the most striking of these transformations were the Flame Atronachs, whose fiery bodies were twisted and refined into the mesmerizing yet perilous Sylphs of Chaos. Their once-flickering flames now refract through shards of mirrored crystal, producing waves of blinding light and sorcery. Graceful, radiant, and lethally capricious, they dance across the battlefield like reflections in a broken mirror, beauty and destruction bound together.*[/font][font=Times New Roman]*When Ithelia was once again erased from memory by the will of her rivals and captors, her servants were left masterless. Yet the echoes of her will persist: Mirrormoor endures, and so do her Daedra, drifting between realms, half-remembered and half-real.**The ancient spells to summon these creatures, shards of forbidden knowledge, can still be found scattered throughout Apocrypha, remnants of the incursions Ithelia once launched against the realm of Hermaeus Mora, her would-be jailor. Those daring enough to read these scripts may call forth the Sylphs of Glass, beings of radiant chaos and mirrored fate.*[/font][/left][left][font=Times New Roman]*﻿*![](https://i.imgur.com/XwFuxsS.png)

[/font][font=Times New Roman]So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.[/font][font=Times New Roman]
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

[/font][font=Times New Roman]The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.[/font][font=Times New Roman]
