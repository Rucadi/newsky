**[b][color=#a4c2f4][size=4]Description**[/color][/b][/size]
  
  
While working on other mods, I noticed that chickens and rabbits do not have any attack animations in their behaviors. For that reason, they cannot attack. However, you can cast spells like Raise Dead and Frenzy on them, but they'll just run up to a target and not actually attack.
  
This little mod takes care of that.
  
Now you can actually encounter killer chickens or even the famous [Rabbit of Caerbannog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit_of_Caerbannog)﻿! /s
  
  
This mod can also be used as a resource to give other creatures a animationless melee attack.
  
  
When a rabbit/chicken gets within range of a target, it will cast a dummy spell, to simulate a melee attack. A sound will play and the chicken/rabbit will do a little jump.

This optional file uses mihail's meshes from [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/88905), to recreate the Rabbit of Caerbannog. I've took a wolf lair in the Rift and made it into the actual Lair of Caerbannog. It also has everything enabled for radiant quests, so certain radiant quests might point you to go there.
  
  
Be warned though! The Killer Bunny is not to underestimated. Compared to regular rabbits, he deals significantly more damage (can one-shit lower level characters) and his Health is much higher than any normal rabbits.

Any mods that edits the rabbit or chicken race records might revert my changes.
  
  
A zombie edition of this mod can be found [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56968). Don't use my mod and that one together, since both do the same thing.
  
  
[The Roost](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/126444) actually expands the Chickenmancer encounter, using this mod as a framework.
  
  
**[b][color=#a4c2f4][size=4]FAQ**[/color][/b][/size]
  
  
Q: Seriously? Rabbits and chickens that attack? What gave you this idea?
  
A: Don't take this mod too seriously. It's just some of my absurd sense of humor combined with some of my extreme nitpicking.
  
  
Q: Do chickens/rabbit actually attack when engaged in combat?
  
A: No, not really, as they are set as cowardly. However, if you cast a Frenzy or Courage spell, they should attack targets.
  
  
Q: ESPFE?
  
A: Yes.
  
  
Q: Does installing/updating/uninstalling on an existing save work?
  
A: As far as I know, it should. However, it's good practice to keep a backup save prior to doing this, just in case.
  
  
Q: Is this compatible with <insert mod>?
  
A: I don't know by heart. You might need to check yourself.
  
  
Q: Will you make a patch for <insert mod>?
  
A: Only if it's a mod I use myself or plan on using, I have enough time and I actually like the idea. Otherwise, feel free to do it yourself. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: I have a suggestion to improve the mod. Can you do it?
  
A: Maybe, if I have time and I like the idea, I'll consider it.
  
  
Q: Will you port this to <insert platform>?
  
A: No, I myself only support the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If someone else wants to port it, feel free. (see permission) If you decide to port it, you yourself take full responsibility to offer support to said port. I will not provide no support for any ports by third parties.
  
  
Q: I use a ported version of this mod on <insert platform> and I have a problem. Can you help?
  
A: I don't provide any support for third party ports on other platforms than the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If you have issues, you should adress the person that ported it.
  
  
Q: Does this work on Skyrim 1.6+, aka "Anniversary Edition"?
  
A: Yes, it should.
  
  
Q: Why don't your mods use MCMs and instead use this janky console command system to set globals?
  
A: I am not a fan of MCMs. You can set the globals by making a patch in xEdit. I have no plans of changing this. If you want to add an MCM, feel free. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: Why don't you use FOMODs?
  
A: That would require reuploading the entire mod, in question, even if I only make a small change. My internet is limited and reuploading the files each time will take a huge chunk of my monthly volume.
