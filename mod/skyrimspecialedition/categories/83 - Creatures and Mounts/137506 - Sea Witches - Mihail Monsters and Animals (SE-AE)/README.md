*"*[/font][font=Times New Roman]*The Cecaelias or Sea Witches make their home in the vast and enigmatic Sea of ​​Ghosts. These creatures, mythical and mysterious in nature, are a species of beings with hybrid characteristics that combine features of octopuses and humans/mer.
  
  
Cecaelias are impressive and disconcerting creatures in terms of appearance: they have limbs similar to those of an octopus, with four to eight long and flexible tentacles that allow them to move gracefully and precisely in the water. These tentacles are equipped with suckers, used both for locomotion and for capturing prey and enemies. The torso and head of a Cecaelia resemble those of a beautiful woman, and their skin can vary in color and texture, from bluish-white tones to darker and rougher tones, providing camouflage in the darkness of the seabed.
  
  
They are intelligent, cunning and extremely vain creatures, with a strong attraction to beauty, magic and power. Known for their ability to plan and execute attack strategies to sink ships and their tendency to guard treasures of great value, they summon powerful storms to destroy boats carrying treasures or magical artifacts across their marine territories.
  
  
It is worth noting however that Sea Witches do not have the vile essence of a Hag, being distinct from their Sea Hag counterpart, with whom they do not mix in any way and with whom they have a strong rivalry. Sea Witches are beautiful, vain and capricious creatures, accustomed to having everything they want and using other beings as means to achieve their goals, nonetheless, they are far from being creatures who delight in suffering and cruelty, and are undoubtedly in love with beauty. Unfortunately, for them this beauty orbits only around their own beings, and although they do not feast on suffering, they do not mind causing it if it results in them acquiring an extra pearl for their necklaces.
  
  
Although they are mainly found in the depths of the Sea of ​​Ghosts, inhabiting sea caves or old shipwrecks, they have also been sighted near icebergs and coastal areas. Their diet is based on a wide variety of marine prey, including fish and crustaceans, and they sometimes even devour lost shipwrecked men. They use their tentacles to capture their prey and their sharp claws to tear it apart.
  
  
Cecaelias tend to be solitary and territorial creatures, avoiding direct contact with other marine life. However, they have been observed to sometimes form groups with Sirens or Mermaids, using powerful control spells to transform them into their slaves and servants. It is common for a single Cecaelia to be accompanied by 2 to 5 Sirens/ Mermaids servants.
  
  
It is known that they have had contact with the Sload in order to obtain magical knowledge, but due to the malevolent and selfish nature of both races, encounters always ended in conflict, although most often it consisted mainly of veiled backstabbing. Occasional interactions with researchers and mages have also been documented, in most cases with unfortunate results due to their unpredictable aggressive nature when they do not get things their way. Whenever a Cecaelia interacts with another intelligent race, it is for some kind of benefit, which is usually detrimental to the other party.
  
  
In popular belief, Cecaelia are portrayed as malevolent, selfish and dangerous creatures, who guard great treasures and magical artifacts inside sunken ships, but are more often than not considered to be just fearsome critters invented by sailors to impress drunken tavern patrons. However, they do exist, and they use powerful elemental spells of water, ice and electricity, with which they drown, freeze or paralyze their enemies, and they can also summon giant sea storms and dangerous gales, along with illusion spells to control other sea creatures and transform them into their guardians and servants. In addition, they can enchant the waters around them to serve as sources of regeneration from wounds and diseases.
  
  
They make ornaments based on sea rocks, corals, gemstones and pearls with which they decorate their bodies, and use whale bones, horker tusks and other oceanic remains to create powerful magical scepters and daggers, covered in inscriptions in an unknown language.
  
  
During the short period of time in which they can remain on dry land, they use water cloak spells to avoid dehydration and conserve their strength.*[/font][font=Times New Roman][font=Times New Roman]*"*

[font=Times New Roman]The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.[/font]
