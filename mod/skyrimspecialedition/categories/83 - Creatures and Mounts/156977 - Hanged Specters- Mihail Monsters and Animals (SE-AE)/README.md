*![](https://i.imgur.com/PwJxVUw.png)*[/font][font=Times New Roman]*"Hanged Specters are the nightmarish remnants of executed criminals who went to the noose unrepentant. Their necrotic, grinning faces reflect the malice they carried in life, and their cruel, echoing laughter chills the air around them. The ropes that once ended their mortal lives have become part of their very essence, grotesquely fused with their flesh—threading through open wounds, erupting from their torso and limbs, and binding them in a macabre embrace.*[/font][font=Times New Roman]*A hood still shadows their withered skulls, while multiple cords remain tightly coiled around their broken necks. They move with dreadful slowness, as if forever shackled by the ropes that claimed them. Yet their hunger for life manifests in spectral projections: ghostly hands that reach out across the void, seeking to seize and drain the essence of their victims. Some also have limbs transformed into hideous amalgamation of rotting flesh and twisted rope, with rusted blades protruding in chaotic growths—an eternal reminder of their lives steeped in crime and violence.*[/font][font=Times New Roman]*Contact with a Hanged Specter leeches vitality, for they are an aegis of wickedness, parasites of dreams and lives, driven by an insatiable urge to claw back into existence. Wretched yet unrepentant, they are cursed souls forever bound to the consequences of their own sins.*[/font][font=Times New Roman]*Because of their archetypal and deeply nightmarish nature, Hanged Specters are often drawn into the dream-realms of Vaermina. In the depths of Quagmire, they transcend the form of a mere wraith, becoming fused with the realm's concept-void itself, manifestations of terror and punishment, eternally lingering in the shadows of nightmare.*[/font][font=Times New Roman]*"*

(\*Who is Beastmaster Mihail? He is my avatar/persona within the universe composed of all my mods. He is the ingame author who writes the texts that are usually presented as descriptions for my mods. A former monster hunter, now a dedicated scholar, he is planned to be released as an NPC in late 2022/early 2023, doing the same job in-game as my descriptions do on Nexus.)
  
  
  
Technical details: [/font][font=Times New Roman]the mod just adds a spell tome that allows you to conjure one of these creatures, and the book is in the Nightcaller Temple's library. There are no other instances of this creature in the mod, only a summon available to the player. When it is conjured, as is often the case with my other Living Nightmares, they affect the surrounding reality for a period of time, which can be just the moment they are summoned, or for the entire time the creature is conjured.

So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
