**Bespoke Bruma Black and Brown Bears**

(also some tweaks for Masked Bears)

  
Overhauls black and brown bears to be more like their [original counterparts from Oblivion](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Bear), while retaining the vanilla artstyle. Also applies the new model to the Masked Bear for a bit of consistency.
  
  
**Features:**
  
  

  
* Black and Brown Bears are now more distinct from their brown and cave bear friends across the mountains.
Cyrodiil's bears are a bit smaller than Skyrim's.
  
* Bears drop appropriate pelts, with leather recipes included.
Any bear trophies in County Bruma will use the updated appearance.
  
* Adjusted the levelled lists in Bruma to make you more likely to face something that isn't an ogre at higher levels so you might actually see the bears.
