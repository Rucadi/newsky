*"**The Ice Jötun, or simply Ice Titan, is one of the now rarely seen, and almost mythological Titan breeds. He has blue skin, an ugly, deformed face covered in warts, and long snow-covered hair and beard. The body is robust and wrinkled, and the arms are long and end in large hands. The feet are also powerful, being able to crush a bear with a single stomp.
  
  
The**Jötnar, or their singular Jötun, are powerful primitive giant sentient beings with brutal elemental magical powers. A Titan resembles a man in many ways, but is ugly like a Troll and taller than a tree. Although a Titan appears capable of reasoning, all attempts to communicate with them to date have ended the same way, in a quick and painful death. This large and strong family generally inhabits mountains, is capable of making simple armor and using heavy weapons. The armor of an Ice Titan is made of animal fur, leather, bones and ropes, as well as metal parts removed from ships, and it wields generally heavy iron anchors, which it uses as weapons to crush enemies, and which the Titan collects from shipwrecks, many of them created by the Titan itself.*[/font][/left][font=Times New Roman]*The Ice Titans are capable of creating ice storms, and myths say that in the past, when they were more common, Titans traveled to the coast to wreck ships with their powerful torments, and then ate the corpses of sailors. It may be a myth, but as they use armor and weapons made from carved bones and ship parts, the myth can be very real. Also, their name "Jötun" means, according to some questionable sources, something related to “voracious” or “gluttonous”, in a lost language of Atmora .*[/font][font=Times New Roman][/font][font=Times New Roman]*They are one of the ancient races of Skyrim, with origin lost in time, alongside the Bolgans and several others, most of them very scarce these days, and were considered a threat by both the powerful ancient Elves and Atmorans, and both created raids to decimate them, killing most of the Titans and forcing the survivors to retreat to the distant mountains. Perhaps this fact justifies the hatred that all Titans have for men and mer, or perhaps they are simply extremely angry beings, with no special reason to that, and perhaps even deeply degenerate and stupid.*[/font][font=Times New Roman][/font][font=Times New Roman]*Despite this, most scholars believe that although the ancient Atmorans described the presence of the Titans in Skyrim when they arrived, and their overwhelming confrontations with them, in fact the Titans are likely descendants of an even older lineage of Atmorans that would have reached Skyrim before the beginning of the best-known Atmoran colonizations, and became what would come to be known as Titans, since, with the necessary differences, they closely resemble men and Giants, being probably a degenerate line of ancient waves of Atmoran immigration.*[/font][font=Times New Roman]*In fact, in the 4th Age only a few of them are still alive, making many people believe that they are just a myth, while most scholars believe that they have become extinct. But, anyone who often travels through the remote snowy mountains knows that they are very real and one of the greatest dangers in Skyrim.*[/font][font=Times New Roman]*Titans are solitary creatures and highly aggressive towards other beings, however there are ancient reports of Ice Titans taming Frost Trolls.*[/font][font=Times New Roman]*In their little-known language, they refer to their place of origin as Jötunheim, therefore not considering themselves natives of Skyrim. Such communications were, however, only possible in ancient times, and was made by powerful magicians who kept the Titans under strong illusion spells, to keep them calm during interviews that honestly never got anywhere, given their very limited vocabulary and intellectual capacity.**"*[/font][left][font=Times New Roman]

So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
