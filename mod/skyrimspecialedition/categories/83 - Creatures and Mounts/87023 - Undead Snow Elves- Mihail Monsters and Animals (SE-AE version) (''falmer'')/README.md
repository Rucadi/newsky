[/font]*"**[font=Times New Roman]Encounters with Zombies and Wights, while always unpleasant, are relatively common for an adventurer exploring Skyrim, but tales of an encounter with a reanimated ancient Snow Elf is something that strays into the realm of myth, and will make many roll their eyes, as if they were listening to just another fairy tale, told to frighten children.
  
  
The Snow Elves, by general consensus, disappeared millennia ago, never to be seen again. They are certainly still around, in the corrupted form we call, perhaps erroneously, the Falmer, but their original elven forms are long gone. It is therefore a surprise when some unsuspecting person reports being ambushed by groups of these elves, who rose in their mummified bodies from the ice beneath the victim's feet, often grabbing the poor soul and trying to bury it in the freezing ice with them. Their armor is said to be made of weathered ivory, and they wield elven weapons with icy enchantments.
  
  
For a learned scholar, aware of the myriad undead abominations that lurk in the dark corners of Tamriel, and also aware that perhaps the worst are not yet known, it is by no means improbable that some reanimated Snow Elf mummies, long buried in the ancient ice of the more remote northern areas of Skyrim, still roam filled with a sense of hatred and revenge against those they consider invaders, who took Skyrim from the hands of the then-proud race of the white elves. Among those scholars who believe in the theory, there are those who attribute their reanimation to Liches or Necromancers, while others believe that it is the work of Wispmothers, which some scholars insist on associating with a form of lichdom by Snow Elf priestesses, a theory however not very popular, especially due to the wide distribution of these beings throughout Tamriel, in places without any presence of Snow Elves throughout history.
  
  
It is unknown if these mummies can be classified as Zombies or Wights, with Zombies being mere reanimated bodies, with little or no sentience or memory, while Wights, although they can often also be under control spells,[/font]*[font=Times New Roman]*have memory, identity and will of their own, even if sometimes fragmented. For example, a decomposing body that drags itself along leaving a trail of putrefied liquid and vermin in a necromancers' dungeon is considered a mere Zombie, and retains very little of what was once an individual and independent being, while a Draugr has sentience, will and memories, however partial, and uses them as he performs his loyal service to the Cult of the Dragon, patrolling and defending the ancient tombs against invaders."*[/font]

A former monster hunter, now a dedicated scholar, he is planned to be released as an NPC in late 2022/early 2023, doing the same job in-game as my descriptions do on Nexus.)
  
  
  
**Technical info:**Undead Snow Elves spawn only in the Forgotten Valley, usually near ruins of their civilization. All respawn, with the exception of the unique Undead Snow Elf named Knight-Paladin Mithribor, who appears in the Forgotten Valley Forest, replacing the Falmer Warmonger who in the vanilla game carries Auriel's Shield, now carried by the undead.[/font][/left][left][/left][left][font=Times New Roman]

- Auriel's Shield can now be obtained from the unique Undead Snow Elf boss Knight-Paladin Mithribor. It replaces the vanilla Falmer with the shield, and spawns on the same original location.

So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
