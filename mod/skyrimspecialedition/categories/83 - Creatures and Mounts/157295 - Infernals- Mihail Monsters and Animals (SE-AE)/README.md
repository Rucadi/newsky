*![](https://i.imgur.com/PwJxVUw.png)**“The Infernals of Mehrunes Dagon are not warriors in the common sense, but walking cataclysms. Their massive forms, forged of volcanic rock, rise like living fortresses above mortals and lesser daedra alike. To stand in their shadow is to feel the weight of Oblivion pressing upon Mundus, as if the very world strains beneath their presence. Their steps fracture stone, their strikes topple towers, and their sheer size makes mockery of walls and gates.**Yet it is not their strength alone that marks them as horrors of legend, but the fire that fuels them. It is not the red blaze of the Deadlands, but the green Flame of Ambition — the essence of Dagon’s will. This fire devours purpose, spirit, and destiny, leaving only ruin in its wake. Where the common flame of destruction reduces flesh to ash, the green fire of the Infernal consumes even what lies beyond flesh, unmaking all bonds that tie a being to life or hope.**The Infernals are not daedra born of natural chaos, but deliberate works of destruction. They are constructs wrought by the Prince of Change himself, animated not by life but by endless hunger. Unlike the disciplined Dremora or the cunning Xivilai, these giants cannot be reasoned with or restrained. They exist for one purpose only: to embody Dagon’s eternal truth — that all ambition leads to ruin, and all things fall before Destruction.**To face an Infernal is to face despair given form. They loom above armies like mountains of stone and fire, their green flames casting the battlefield in an unearthly glow. Victory against one is not triumph, but survival; for their presence alone is enough to remind mortals that the power of Mehrunes Dagon cannot be contained, only endured.”*

(\*Who is Beastmaster Mihail? He is my avatar/persona within the universe composed of all my mods. He is the ingame author who writes the texts that are usually presented as descriptions for my mods. A former monster hunter, now a dedicated scholar, he is planned to be released as an NPC in late 2022/early 2023, doing the same job in-game as my descriptions do on Nexus.)
  
  
  
**Technical details:** the mod just adds a spell tome that allows you to conjure one of these creatures. The tome can be found exclusively in the Archmage's Quarters in the College of Winterhold, on a shelf surrounded by other books — only after you have become Archmage. The tome will not appear until the player has officially taken the title of Archmage, making it a true reward for mastering the magical arts.

So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
