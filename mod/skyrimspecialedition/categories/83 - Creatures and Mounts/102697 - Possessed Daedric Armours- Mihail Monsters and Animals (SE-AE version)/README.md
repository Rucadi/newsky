* [font=Times New Roman]*This mod is a compilation of my Aegis of the Sigil ([LE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/111100/)﻿﻿﻿/[SE-AE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64193)﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿) and Doomsday of Blades [i]([LE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/115388)﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿/[SE-A﻿E](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89684)﻿﻿﻿)* mods. If you use these 2 mods, by downloading this new file you will be able to delete these 2 esps, thus saving space in your load order;[/i][/font]
[font=Times New Roman]*Obviously you should not use this mod together with the 2 mentioned above, since they are already compiled in this new file, and using them at the same time will double the amount of these creatures in your game, in addition to other possible problems;*[/font]

I've worked hard for years to offer you the best of me for free, and the only thing I ask in return is this gesture, which increases my relevance and engagement on Nexus, and motivates me to continue;[/font]*

*My fearsome daedric possessed armours now in a single .esp. These guardians animated by powerful Oblivion magic will bring all your enemies to their knees.*
  
  
From Aegis of the Sigil page:
  
  
[/font][font=Times New Roman]*"A type of animated daedric armor set, created especially to protect the Sigil Stones that hold the Gates of Oblivion open, these golem-like constructs have 6 arms that deliver merciless, fiery blows.
  
  
A rare construct to be found bound on Nirn, or even being conjured in battle, most are confined to the towers of Oblivion they defend, fulfilling the unique and exclusive function for which they were created."*

(\*Who is Beastmaster Mihail? He is my avatar/persona within the universe composed of all my mods. He is the ingame author who writes the texts that are usually presented as descriptions for my mods. A former monster hunter, now a dedicated scholar, he is planned to be released as an NPC in late 2022/early 2023, doing the same job in-game as my descriptions do on Nexus.)
  
  
  
[/font][font=Times New Roman]How to obtain the conjuration spell: the player must use the Atronach Forge in The Midden, under the College of Winterhold, to conjure a spelltome book from which it will be possible to learn the conjuration spell of an Aegis of the Sigil. Sacrificing in the forge 1 ebony cuirass, 1 ebony gauntlets, 1 ebony helmet and 1 ebony mace, all of them not enchanted, in addition to 1 daedra heart, 1 fire salts, 1 black soul gem, 1 centurion dynamo core and 1 ruined book, it will be possible to conjure the book in the center of the forge. It is also possible to find a book already summoned in the Midden, probably the result of a conjuration from the past, but it is very well hidden.[/font][font=Times New Roman]
  
  
  
  
From Doomsday of Blades page:
  
﻿﻿
  
[/font][font=Times New Roman]*"Doomsday of Blades are rare magically animated pieces of Mythic Dawn armor, with four arms that wield 2 pairs of sharp curved blades, which they use fiercely in combat. The head has 4 faces, each one looking in one direction, and in constant rotation, leaving no open space for the enemy.
  
  
An occasional occurrence during the events leading up to the Oblivion Crisis, these days it is virtually impossible to find one of these constructs, but as with members of the supposedly extinct order, never say never."*

[/font][font=Times New Roman]How to obtain the conjuration spell: [/font][font=Times New Roman]This creature is only obtainable as a summon, and the unique book is in the room where Harkon keeps a banner of the Mythic Dawn, in Castle Volkihar. Like the banner, the spelltome was also kept as a trophy, from when the Mythic Dawn tried to invade the Vampire Lord's castle, around 200 years ago.

So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
