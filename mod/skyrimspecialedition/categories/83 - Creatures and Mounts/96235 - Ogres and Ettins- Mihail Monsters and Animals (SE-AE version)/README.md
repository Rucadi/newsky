*These brutal creatures of fearsome strength, but low intelligence and foul smell, now all in one single file. Prepare your shield and your nose!*
  
From Ogres page:
  
  
*﻿*[/font]*[font=Times New Roman]"Ogres are large, seemingly dim-witted orc-kin found throughout Tamriel, both living in open areas and deep caverns. Best known for their great strength and terrible stench, Ogres have blue or greenish skin, pronounced teeth, bulky bodies with large limbs, elven ears with drooping tips, and, according to some scholars, cannibalistic tendencies. Dangerous, they often ambush travelers, or even attack settlements, crushing their victims with stones and wooden clubs until they turn into pools of blood.[/font]*[/left]*[font=Times New Roman]
  
After having had many of their settlements taken over by bandits and Forsworn, they seem to have developed a special hatred for both, especially the latter, with incursions by groups of Ogres to try to retake these places. As a result of the Civil War and the increased presence of patrols in the then less guarded less populated areas of Skyrim, many places once occupied by creatures such as Goblins and Ogres are now occupied by outlaw humans, which forced these creatures to live nomadic lives, and destroying most of their settlements in the province, thus erasing remnants of their rudimentary primitive culture.
  
  
Due to the prejudice of the self-proclaimed superior races, the rights of the Ogres are not an important issue for those responsible for looking after the province's less favored sentient inhabitants, making the Ogres an entirely marginalized species and no different from a bear or wolf in a Nord's view. In fact, this view is recurrent across most of Tamriel, with Ogres being used as slaves for forced labor or tanks for war against their wills. Malacath, as patron of Ogres and all Orc-kin, loathes and rages at such practices, often sending emissaries to free these Ogres and punish those responsible. Due to their simple minds, many Ogres also end up working as mercenaries for bandits, in exchange for drink or food. But it is in the strongholds of the Orcs that the more civilized Ogres find the greatest tolerance and protection, working as free creatures in the Orc mines and as guardians of the strongholds. However, and although seen as taboo, some Orcs enjoy Ogre meat as a fine delicacy.
  
  
Like the Goblins and the Rieklings, the Ogres were more developed in the past, never at a level similar to that of the Elves or Humans, or even the Goblins, but they have already manifested a greater intelligence and culture in the past, gradually becoming bestialized since then. Even the existence of Ogre Shamans in the past is reported, while nowadays the occurrence of Ogres with magical abilities is basically non-existent. Since the disappearance of magical abilities in a species formerly able to use them is a sign of receding intelligence, scholars assume that Ogres are clearly devolving, as are nearly all Orc-kin.
  
  
Ogres appear wearing anything from simple clothing made of fur and leather to large pieces of rusted iron armor adorned with sharp bones. They use weapons ranging from wooden and iron-reinforced clubs to simple stones they pick up from the ground. They paint their bodies with ritualistic paint, and in Skyrim they can appear either in the common greenish variant, or with blue skin, a subspecies known as the Snowhills Ogres, which inhabit colder mountainous regions. Some Ogres in the service of the Orcs are more heavily equipped, including using Orc-style weapons and armor pieces."[/font]*[left][font=Times New Roman]

From Ettins page:
  
  
[/font]*[font=Times New Roman]"Ettins are hulking, two-headed abominations with an immense hatred for all living things. Descendants of a tribe of Ogres cursed by Malacath himself in ancient times, these tormented beasts of incredible strength but limited intellect are everything an adventurer doesn't want to encounter. Like all Orc-kin, Ogres are protected and guided by Malacath, who has always seen them as the embodiment of strength and brutality. While Goblins represent cunning and Orcs represent honor and bravery, the less-than-intellectually bright Ogres have always been an aegis of brute strength to Malacath and all Orc-kin. 
  
  
Malacath's ways are hard and unforgiving, with no room for softness or weakness, and the valor of battle is ever-present in the minds and hearts of those who follow this Prince. One can imagine, then, how disgusted Malacath was when a tribe of Ogres began to develop a pacifist and animistic stance towards the world and all who inhabit it. Skilled in the use of magic, especially in more creative and less destructive schools, these Ogres began to preach a less violent lifestyle, the abolition of cannibalistic practices, the development of agriculture, a system of government based on wisdom, not force, among other changes, which started to affect even other neighboring tribes. It is important to note that Ogres in past ages, while never particularly brilliant, were more developed than in the fourth age, and the existence of magic among them even occurred, although shamans were generally oriented towards destruction magic and the principles of Malacath's ways. However, as mentioned, this tribe began to question these principles and seek a different path.
  
  
Enraged, Malacath ordered those still loyal to him to withdraw from the tribe and found a new clan, which led to countless Ogres leaving the influence of the tribe's shamans and those who decided to stay and follow them and their reactionary teachings. This divided several families, and affected the simple hearts and minds of these creatures, divided between loving their god and patron, or their families and close friends. While the newly founded society maintained its ancient habits of brutality, the one that remained in the new doctrine flourished, expanding and prospering, and even initiating exchanges with other races, breaking the widespread prejudice against the stupidity and irrationality of the Ogres. Members of other tribes approached, and these learned and began to spread the message of the new rules of conduct.
  
  
The imminent "corruption" of his children infuriated Malacath, who ordered that clan formed by exiles from the now prosperous tribe to attack and decimate their former kin, destroying any idea of a new path for the Ogres. However, already somewhat touched by the pacifism and kindness of their former comrades, who never failed to provide them with supplies and attempts at rapprochement, the leaders of this raiding party refused to follow Malacath's orders. Afterwards, all the other members of the new clan joined them, also refusing to attack their families, wives, mothers, children and the kind shaman leaders of their old tribe, begging Malacath not to order them to do so. 
  
  
Seeing that this half of the tribe was also "corrupted", and enraged by all this insurgency and attempted revolution, by those who were never bright enough to even question the most basic orders, Malacath then cursed the new clan, saying that since they loved eachother so much, now each exiled Ogre would be merged with a member of the pacifist tribe, being condemned to live in the same misshapen body with two heads and two souls, until death takes them, at which point they would be punished eternally in Malacath's plane of Oblivion, the Ashpit, for their unforgivable betrayals in the eyes of the brutal Daedric Prince Malacath. That said, the two tribes merged, giving rise to deformed and deranged creatures.
  
  
The terror of the promise of eternal punishment, coupled with the constant conflict of two totally different minds and hearts having to share and rule the same body, quickly drove them mad. The tribe was destroyed, the now mad two-headed monsters spread across the world, abandoning their ideals of pacifism, and not even keeping to Malacath's original ways, but now being a simple embodiment of hatred for all that is natural and harmonious, and which clearly represents an opposition to their unnatural and inharmonious existence. The other Ogres, too simple-minded to understand what really happened, thought that this was the simple consequence of following a wrong path, and quickly abandoned everything they could have learned from this peculiar pacifist tribe, now transformed into misshapen and mad beasts.
  
  
Ostracized among the Orc-kin, at the behest of Malacath himself, and feared for their furious and crazed behavior, the two-headed beasts have then been spreading, occupying uninhabited places, usually in a solitary lifestyle, in which the sad conflict between two minds in a single body is about as much company as they can handle. These two minds think differently, want different things and each one controls their side of the body, therefore needing to reach a consensus for basic actions such as walking and eating, which does not always happen, leading the Ettins to have a slow and clumsy behavior. The side formed by the warrior Ogre is more dominant, a little more muscular, and uses its physical strength to wield a large and heavy club made of wood and stone, while the side formed by a (formerly) pacifist and magic-oriented Ogre, although smaller and weaker, uses powerful destruction magic, wielding a staff decorated with gourds and feathers. Their bodies are greenish like the Ogres, but they are twice the size of one, being slower and noisier, and with the two heads constantly arguing with each other. The magical side wears ornamentation and clothing typical of ancient Ogre shamans, while the warrior side wears heavy pieces of rusted iron armor decorated with spiked bones.
  
  
According to the Orc Wisewomen, Malacath cursed the Ettins to reincarnate for eons until the end of Kalpa, always as children of the same cursed species, passing through periods of torture in the Ashpit between reincarnations, and returning in each new incarnation as more insane and more thirsty for undoing. Thus, when on rare occasions two Ettins (or four depending on one's point of view) tolerate each other long enough to produce a child, it will be the reincarnation of one of the original cursed Ettins from eons ago, returning after a period of torture in Oblivion.
  
  
Interestingly they seem to tolerate and have some connection, and even train, some predators like bears or wolves, being sometimes seen with them, in the remote places of the tundra where they live isolated from any civilization. They can also, rarely, be seen around witches without showing hostility towards them, which makes many scholars think that they are actually the product of the black magic of the witches who transformed the Ogres, and that the whole legend involving Malacath is just folklore and bedtime stories for Orc children.
  
  
The origin of the name Ettin is believed by some scholars to be derived from the Tamrielic word "Twin", and how most Orc-kin and Ettins themselves managed to pronounce it."[/font]*[font=Times New Roman]

So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
