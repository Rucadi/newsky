*A terrifying bundle with 39 of my undead skeletal creations
  
to add an extra touch of horror to your spooky month.**From Bone Colossus page:*
  
  
*"Bone Colossi are large undead golems formed from thousands of bones gathered together in a vaguely humanoid form and animated using powerful necromancy. They are conjured from piles of osseous matter by Bonemasters and use small Bonelings as their minions. The most powerful Colossi are imbued with elemental magic such as fire or shock. A Bone Colossus can be animated in many different ways, usually using the soul of a powerful (or artificially powered) spirit imprisoned by necromancy as the source of the golem's "life", or, less often, a daedric animus. As with other terrifying abominations such as the golems known as Legions, legends speak of massive Bone Colossi being animated by the souls of entire armies and possessing the internal conflict and dangerous instability that a being with tens or hundreds of conflicting personalities would have.**Bonemasters, powerful sorcerers resurrected by dark forces, are the most common creators of these abominations from beyond the grave. It should be noted that these walking skeletons differ from Liches: a Lich is a necromancer who has directly forced his way through the confines of death and beyond, becoming immortal, albeit paying the high price of decay and constant hunger for souls to maintain his existence, in a somewhat unstable and fragile undead form. A Bonemaster, on the other hand, is simply a powerful necromancer who has been resurrected by external forces, and who therefore has not attained undead status on his own, unlike a Lich. Although they are still sentient and apparently retain their personalities (as evidenced by powerful mages who have managed to temporarily control them and engage in some sort of conversation), scholars question the extent to which they actually have this apparent free will, or whether they are simply under the direct influence of the ones who resurrected them, serving as minions and nothing more, possibly not even knowing it. However, Bonemasters are in fact the ones who imbue their creations with the elemental magic that surrounds them and, like their constructs, Bonemasters are also coated with considerable elemental protection against the very element they dominate, which undoubtedly shows immense power on the part of these undead mages. It should be noted that some even have control over fire, something that is usually enough to drive most of the undead back to the grave, including many so-called mighty Liches.**Bonelings are small bone constructs created as aids to the Bone Colossus, often seen re-adjusting the leather straps that hold the Colossus' bones in place. When these straps come loose or break, they end up leaving the bones dangling, affecting the golem's stability and efficiency. Some experts speculate that they may be the reanimated bones of children, but it is unknown if this is their true origin. Fragile and mischievous, they use long dragon-wing bones as spears to defend their giant masters."*

A former monster hunter, now a dedicated scholar, he is planned to be released as an NPC in late 2022/early 2023, doing the same job in-game as my descriptions do on Nexus.)
  
  
  
  
*From Gravelords page:**﻿"Gravelords are enigmatic entities formed by hundreds of blackened bones covered in a cloak of dense darkness. They are the spawn of Sithis, the representation of the primordial emptiness and the Void, a state outside the concepts of Aedric or Daedric. However, they also roam the darkest places of Nirn and Oblivion, surrounded by their terrifying armies of fearsome Gravelord Servants. People who have been unlucky enough to find one of them and have survived have said that they continually proclaim the Black Sacrament in sadistic and frightening tone, and while this obsessive proclamation does not necessarily associate them with the Dark Brotherhood itself, it undoubtedly draws a link between them and the Night Mother, bride of Sithis.
  
  
A Gravelord's body is that of an immensely sized skeleton, covered by many darkned human skeletons joined together as some sort of armor. The upper body leans forwards, giving him a hunchback appearance, his apparent head is tucked into the dead matter and bones on top of the osseous pile, his entire torso is covered in ribcages and skulls, with limbs dangling all around him. His legs are extemely heavy, due to the ammount of bones attached to them, what makes them slow. His left hand is a giant natural skeletal hand, while his right upper limb is equipped with a triple bone forearm, which terminates in a sharpened giant bone blade. Some of the skeletons that adorn him as body armor, are raised in combat as minions by the Gravelord. A Gravelord's body is covered in an all concealing cloak made of dark miasma, with the consistency of oil, formed by the own essence of death, in constant movement around the terrifying bone figure, and that causes in those who see it up close an intense feeling of despair and emptiness.
  
  
In the past, the Dark Brotherhood was known to be able to summon lesser versions of these entities to punish traitorous members. When summoned for this purpose, these Gravelords were then known as Wraiths of Sithis."*

*From Shambles page:*
  
  
*"Shambles are animated constructs of bones, arranged in an unusual way, and tied together using thongs of frayed leather, with rusted iron medallions that firmly attach these thongs to the dry, brittle bones that form the strange undead.**While most bones appear to be of human origin, some appear to come from other types of creatures. The form is humanoid, but very fragile, with dull-colored, brittle bones, denoting deterioration and decay. The unsteady way in which they are built causes them to tremble and produce a constant rattling noise.**Their constitution would drive any orthopedist crazy, with collarbones for elbows, arms for legs, legs for arms, a head made up of pelvic bones and a tangle of hands and forearms purposely cut for sharp edges. Left hand and feet end in reshaped bones in the form of claws, and a large bone dagger figures in place of the right hand, all this and much more makes these creatures from the Shivering Isles a worthy resident of the realm of lack of sense and logic.*
  
*In the center of their chests, there is a core of ice energy, which causes their attacks to do some elemental damage, and creates an explosion of the same element when the Shambles is destroyed.
  
  
Its creation is mostly attributed to the Zealots that inhabit the Dementia region of the Shivering Isles, but they can be found in other realms as well, though rarely,**and even in Nirn, being summoned by necromancers.**Due to their fragile and illogical construction, it is common for Shambles to lose limbs, and even their heads, but still continuing to function until they are completely destroyed."***by Beastmaster Mihail \***

*From Ancient Skeletons page:*
  
*"**In ancient times, dating as far back as the Meretich Era, when not even the Blades had yet appeared, groups of honorable, strong, and proud men raised their weapons against the tyranny of the Dragons in Skyrim, when almost everyone else still saw them as powerful gods to be venerated. These heroic and anonymous men have no songs about their deeds, no graveyards, no legends, they mean nothing to the Norse people they gave their lives millennia ago to defend, against an enemy much more powerful than themselves. Scholars believe that these warriors were Nedes, or even ancient Bretons, but there is no definitive conclusion. Their equipment style do not exactly resemble that used by the proto-Nords and Nords of those times, despite having an above average height like them.
  
  
Despite being long dead, these heroes and the Dragons seem to have some sort of connection between their souls, and in modern times, with the Dragons reappearing from their hiding places, or even rising from their tombs, the souls, or fragments of them, of these ancient fallen warriors are returning to their bones to fulfill their duty again: to slay the Dragons and destroy their powerful servants, the Draugr and the Dragon Priests. It is unknown what level of sentience they maintain, but there is still some sort of purpose in their bones, as they seem to specifically attack directly the Dragon mounds and Norse ruins where the Dragons are located, or at least their former minions.
  
  
Many scholars believe that the event of these ancient skeletons returning may be caused by them being intentionally reanimated and programmed by someone or some group, with veiled actions aimed at preventing the return of the Dragons, rather than a simple curse of the soul lost in time. In any case, one thing is certain, the focus of these undead is simply the destruction of the Dragons and their followers, and they pursue this role in a ruthless and robotic way, abdicating their own sense of integrity.
  
  
Although their equipment appear rusty and broken, corroded by time, they are faster and more intelligent in combat than most skeletons animated by regular means, in part because these ancient skeletons apparently have a soul, or fragments of it, in control of their bones, unlike most normal reanimated skeletons. In some ways, the undead state of the ancient skeletons is similar to that of the Draugr and just like the latter, the ancient skeletons appear to have thoughts and purposes, although apparently mechanically and/or obsessively directed towards a single mission, and even if limited, unlike common reanimated skeletons who are just mindless puppets, as mentioned previously.
  
  
Their rusty iron weapons, despite being worn and even damaged, seem to have a special effect on Dragons, which makes sense considering their past as professional Dragon slayers and possibly due to some kind of ancient magical enchantment**."*

*From Damaged Skeletons page:*"With this mod, 16 new variants of damaged skeletons are added to the game, after all, it doesn't make sense that every skeleton reanimated by necromancy has all the bones intact. From decapitated skeletons, skeletons with missing limbs, or even not being able to hold weapons due to the complete absence of both arms and having to attack with headbutts, your skeleton experience will never be the same."

So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods. As the mod edits the "skeletons" of the 16 new damaged vanilla Skeletons instead of the models directly, possibly this mod is compatible with all model replacers, retextures and even mods that edit things like VFXs (like the ones that remove the blue glow from their eyes), or sounds.
  
  
**One last addendum:** It's not a problem with this mod per se and you probably won't even need to worry about this because you will not experience the bug, but when this mod was built many years ago it used a set of tutorials and textures for some of the blue fire spells used by the Stonefire Bone Colossi and their respective Bonemasters and Bonelings. It turns out that despite being magnificent, this set of resources had a small bug that caused the arrows fired to have a blue fire trail associated with them. When I detected this problem, I ran to solve it, however, any other mod that has used the same tutorials and resources in the past, and hasn't noticed this bug, or at least hasn't solved it, when used together with my Bone Colossus mod will cause the problem to return, because it will reinstall the problematic meshes that were deleted by me on my mod folder. Obviously I don't have control over which mods share these same assets and which among them fixed the bug or not, nor do I know which mods they are (apparently Naruto Ultimate Overhaul and consequently The Uchiha Clan are two of them). In case you got the bug, go to Meshes > mps, and delete the following files: BLUEmpsfireballsmoketrail, BLUEmpsfireballsparktrail, BLUEmpsfireboltfire01, BLUEmpsfireboltimpact01, BLUEmpsfirewallbase, BLUEmpsfirewallsparks, BLUEmpsfirewaveflames, BLUEmpsflamesfire and mpsfirestormareaflamesBLUE. If these files are present inside the "mps" folder, it means that you have installed a mod that still has this bug in its structure, and that will end up making the same bug reappear in my mod.
  
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
