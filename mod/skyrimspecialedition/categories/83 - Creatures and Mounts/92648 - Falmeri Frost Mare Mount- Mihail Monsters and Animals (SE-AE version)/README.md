* [font=Times New Roman]*This mod is the standalone version of the Falmeri Frost Mare, originally released[i] in my Frost Coursers mod ([LE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/100571)﻿﻿ / [SE-AE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30973)﻿). If you have the mentioned mod installed, you already have the Falmer Frost Mare in your game and you don't need to download this mod which only adds the mentioned creature and no other creatures contained in the original mod;*[/i][/font]
[font=Times New Roman]*Obviously you should not use this mod together with the Frost Coursers mod mentioned above, since the latter already adds Falmeri Frost Mare to your game, and using them at the same time will double the amount of the mentioned mount in your game, in addition to other possible problems;*[/font]

Equipped with refined ivory armor, these mares appear to be made of the purest, hardest ice, and shrouded in icy wind. That same icy wind forms their manes and tails, and allows them to freeze any enemy that approaches them. Their tremendously strong hooves cause blasts of ice, and their bravery allowed them to face fearlessly even Grahls and Frost Trolls. Snow Elf royalty drove ivory chariots drawn by 2 or more mares into battle, and legends tell that their image charging into the battlefield bordered the divine. Today they are seen as folklore as their masters have no longer ridden them into war since the conflict between the Nords and Snow Elves, now lost in time.**The origin of the Frost Mares is unknown, with some describing their earliest appearances as coming from icy realms of Oblivion, but with the origin of the Falmeri version being attributed to the magical creative power of the Snow Elf mages themselves."***by Beastmaster Mihail \***

Techincal info: The last place you can learn how to summon one as a mount is in Darkfall Cave, next to the Snow Elf Gelebor's belongings. He will let you take the book and learn the spell. It works similarly to Arvak, it can be killed, but can be summoned again as many times as you wish. The horse is particularly stronger and braver in combat than normal horses, dealing slightly more damage, especially elemental ice damage, and being more aggressive in battle. However, they have a slower initial sprint than a normal horse and take longer to slow down and shift directions, but nothing too significant. On the other hand, its stamina regenerates faster and has the advantage of having more HP, which also regenerates, although nowhere near Shadowmere's HP and health regeneration speed. Frost Mares are faster than a normal horse and still have the advantage of having more resistance and faster regeneration. Arvak, however, remains the fastest horse, and Shadowmere the strongest. Frost mares are summoned for 1 minute, but if you're mounted on them, they won't disappear until you dismount.

So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
