**[ [ [ MOD DESCRIPTION ] ] ]****If you're like me and have been disappointed with the vanilla Dwarven Spiders, then this mod is for you.  This mod replaces the vanilla Dwarven Spider skeleton with a new custom skeleton meant to give the Dwarven Spiders of Skyrim a more simulated mechanical Arachnid appearance****. Working within the confines of the vanilla mesh, I adjusted the limbs and body with several subtle changes to the Dwarven Spiders, and the result is a Dwarven Spider that will startle and fill with dread any** **squeamish adventurer****who delves into the depths of Skyrim. This affects all Dwarven spiders in Skyrim.****! ! ! SEEING IS BELIEVING ! ! !

**[ [ [ MOD COMPATIBILITY ] ] ]****Dreaded Dwarven Spiders uses a custom skeleton for the vanilla Dwarven Spiders and will overwrite any mod that makes changes to the vanilla Dwarven Spider skeleton.  Mods that make sweeping changes to vanilla skeletons e.g."Realistic Ragdoll and Force"****should be compatible as long as "Dreaded Dwarven Spiders" is installed after those mods and allowed to overwrite their files.**
  
  
**Should be fully compatible with any texture mods, since this mod contains no textures of it's own only a skeleton.  Which also makes it compatible with most other creature mods that do not edit vanilla skeletons.****[ [ [ INSTALLATION ] ] ]****Recommend using Nexus Mod Manager or your favorite mod manager.****Install "Dreaded Dwarven Spiders" after any mod that makes changes to the vanilla Dwarven Spiders and click "Yes to all" when prompted to overwrite any files.
  
  
 There is no"esp plugin" with this mod.****[ [ [ MY OTHER MODS ] ] ]****If you like this mod then I'm sure you'll enjoy my other mods as well.
