*The elemental power of fire, ice and shock personified in these mighty golems, the ideal conjurations for any powerful wizard and now all in one bundle for you.**From Ancient Ice Golem page:*
  
  
  
﻿
  
*"**Ice Golems are gigantic, sentient constructs, created by the ancient Nords, made of pure ice and animated by powerful sorcery from ages long lost in the past. In general, golems follow simple tasks given to them by their masters, and are basically simpler man-made atronachs, often based on brute force. In most cases, they are ordered to protect some place or item and are still bound by that duty even when their masters are long dead. However, this type of golem made of ice seems to be especially difficult to deal with: some of the Ice Golems were simply born unbound or became uncontrollable after some time in service and ended up killing their masters and disappearing amid the snowy forests and remote mountains of Skyrim. Some attempts to reproduce the methods of creating these beings in current times, following ancient manuals, ended in gigantic golems engaging in violent attacks, destroying entire covenants, just as they did in the past.
  
  
A lineage of scholars believes that the ice of Skyrim has intense magical properties and a particularly stormy and potent energy, and that this would be the reason for so many accidents involving Ice Golems generated in the province, and their apparently inexplicable rebelliousness and malevolent tendencies. Whether fact or not, it is certainly a fact that Ancient Ice Golems have a very strong and independent personality, which is rare for this type of creature, as golems are commonly only semi-sentient, or even often just mindless machines animated by magic, or artifacts, not having a human, animal or daedra soul within them. Despite this, the strength and resilience of Ice Golems are quite similar to other golems of the same size, they tend to be however somewhat more agile compared to other large constructs, such as Moss or Stone Golems, but are not as heavily armored. They are only able to survive in cold climates, as Ice Golems will melt in warmer regions unless some sort of magic is applied to prevent this.
  
  
As Skyrim's Frost Atronachs are also brute ice giant constructs, but much more easily tamed, and especially used to replace the dangerous and unpredictable Ice Golems, wizards typically no longer attempt to create Ice Golems to serve as guardians. Because of this fact, the only rare ones that remain in the wild are the strays from bygone eras, and one or two recent experiments that went wrong for their brave but reckless creators.
  
  
Ice Golems live in snowy forests and use mimicry and camouflage to ambush their prey: they usually stick a snowy pine tree to the top of their back and remain buried in the snow with only the pine tree visible, commonly near forest roads, and when a human, carriage, or animal approaches, they rise from the ground abruptly to devour their prey. It is curiously strange to see golems acting as true predators, since, as a rule, the constructs do not feel hunger, thirst or any other need typical of organic beings, but these ice beasts not only hunt and feed on their prey, but also appear to be modeled precisely for this typical animal need. While the few domesticated Ice Golems in Skyrim described by ancient literature were less animalistic in appearance, being more like humanoid ice armor, and smaller than a Giant, the wild Ice Golems found throughout Skyrim's icy north are much larger, with giant claws made of the hardest ice, a huge mouth full of sharp teeth, and a torso covered in dangerous huge ice spikes, not to mention the aforementioned tree attached to their back, used as a camouflage during their hunts. This adaptation to the environment that occurs in ancient stray golems, slowly blending with the nature that surrounds them, will finally end up one day causing the constructs to dissolve into the essence that originated their artificial existence, thus returning to their basic element, which could take centuries, depending on the power of the golem itself.
  
  
Due to this animalistic metamorphosis, some scholars speculate that these unbound Ancient Ice Golems are actually possessed by nature spirits, such as powerful Ice Wraiths, Wispmothers, or other similar creatures, but these are just speculations without proof. What is known for a fact is that these unusual characteristics and mutations place the wild Ice Golems far above most other elemental constructs such as Storm and Fire Golems.**"*

*From Fire Golem page:**"Fire Golems are animated humanoid constructs molded from firestone, at temperatures that reach considerable high levels, and possessing enviable flaming powers. They are adorned with rune bracelets imbued with magical properties of condensation and containment and are certainly superior to a common Flame Atronach. Fire Golems are the ideal summons for experienced pyromancers, who seek a brute force which can still competently use the most diverse variations of fire element spells."*

Extra info: Found in Nirn usually when summoned by pyromancers in battle, it is among the loot
  
of these mages that an adventurer can find the spell to summon these Fire Golems as well.
  
  
  
  
*From Storm Golem page:*
  
  
*"Storm Golems are the elite among other electricity-based atronachs. Powerful, they can launch a wide variety of intense lightning attacks, as well as being completely immune to any level of electrical current. They appear to be formed from containing a Storm Atronach through magical bracelets, which force it into a more humanoid form, while causing its power to build up in its core, causing tremendous pressure and preventing it from dissipating, elevating the golem to levels above any other Storm Atronach.
  
  
Its creation can be executed in many ways and have different origins, but in general the electrified rock form is animated by a daedric spirit. One of the places where they are described as existing in particular concentration is Soul Cairn: they are not particularly welcome by the Ideal Masters, but the intense electrical activity in the skies of the necromancer realm makes this cursed place irresistible to these sons of thunder."*

(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
