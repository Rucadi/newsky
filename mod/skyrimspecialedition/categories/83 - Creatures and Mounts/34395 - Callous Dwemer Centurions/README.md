**[ [ [ MOD DESCRIPTION ] ] ]****If you're like me and have been disappointed with the vanilla Dwemer Centurions, then this mod is for you.  This mod replaces the vanilla Dwemer Centurion skeleton with a new custom skeleton meant to give the Dwemer Centurions of Skyrim a more maneuverable, intimidating and technologically-advanced****appearance. Working within the confines of the vanilla mesh, I enhanced the limbs and made several subtle changes to the Dwemer Centurions, and the result is a callous murderous giant machine man,  immersing you even more into the world of Skyrim. This affects all Dwemer Centurions in Skyrim.**

CALLOUS DWEMER CENTURIONS ! ! !****[ [ [ MOD COMPATIBILITY ] ] ]****Callous Dwemer Centurions uses a custom skeleton for the vanilla Dwemer Centurions and will overwrite any mod that makes changes to the vanilla Dwarven** **Centurion****skeleton.  Mods that make sweeping changes to vanilla skeletons e.g."Realistic Ragdoll and Force"****should be compatible as long as "Callous Dwemer Centurions" is installed after those mods and allowed to overwrite their files.**
  
  
**Should be fully compatible with any texture mods, since this mod contains no textures of it's own only a skeleton.  Which also makes it compatible with most other creature mods that do not edit vanilla skeletons.****[ [ [ INSTALLATION ] ] ]****Recommend using your favorite mod manager.****Install "Callous Dwemer Centurions"** **after** **any mod that makes changes to the vanilla Dwemer Centurions and** **"Overwrite" any files** **when prompted.****There is no"esp plugin" with this mod****.**
