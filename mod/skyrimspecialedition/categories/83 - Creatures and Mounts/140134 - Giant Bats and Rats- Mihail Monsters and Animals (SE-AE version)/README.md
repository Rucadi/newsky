* [font=Times New Roman]*This mod is a compilation of my Enemy Bats ([LE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/88088)﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿/[SE-AE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24990)﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿) and Giant Rats [i]([LE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/88404)﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿/[SE-A﻿E](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24609)﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿)* mods. If you use these 2 mods, by downloading this new file you will be able to delete these 2 esps, thus saving space in your load order;[/i][/font]
[font=Times New Roman]*Obviously you should not use this mod together with the 2 mentioned above, since they are already compiled in this new file, and using them at the same time will double the amount of these creatures in your game, in addition to other possible problems;*[/font]

[/font]* *[font=Times New Roman]If you use, like and value my work, please consider giving an endorsement. I've worked hard for years to offer you the best of me for free, and the only thing I ask in return is this gesture, which increases my relevance and engagement on Nexus, and motivates me to continue;[/font]*
[font=Times New Roman]*I do not inspect or have any influence over translations of my mods (including those linked directly on my pages), nor do I have any power over patches or add-ons made to my content. So, before using any unofficial add-ons for my mods, make sure they conform to the latest version of my official release, and never use these if they don't. The same applies to Xbox ports;*[/font]

From Enemy Bats page:

[font=Times New Roman]
  
[/font]*[font=Times New Roman]Add aggressive bats to your game by populating the ruins,
  
caves and tombs with this flying creature of the night.[/font]*[font=Times New Roman]
  
  
  
  
  
From Giant Rats page:
  
  
[/font][font=Times New Roman]*"*[/font][font=Times New Roman]*Giant Rats are aggressive, medium-sized rodents that can be found in sewers, mines, ruined forts, abandoned buildings, poorly maintained halls of the dead, and caves. They have no exceptional strengths, but they are carriers of unpleasant diseases.
  
  
They can also be found in Nordic dungeons, but Draugrs seem to dislike them because of their high proliferation and destructive behavior, which puts the organization and routine of the Draugr dungeons at risk.
  
  
Forsworn also do not allow them in their camps, while some bandits have sometimes a few rats living with them in caves, probably as guards or pets, or perhaps even as a food resource. Some Rieklings do the same in Solstheim, as do some Goblins in the Imperial Province.*[/font][font=Times New Roman]*"*

* So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.
    
  (OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
