*"In the reeking bogs and shadow-choked hollows of Dementia, where the air clings wet to the skin and even thoughts grow mold, there lies a magic most unnatural. A magic that does not shape flesh—it summons it, unbidden, from the rot of the realm itself.
  
  
Madness ore is a thorned, mineral substance that bursts forth from pools of shapeless flesh found across the lands of Dementia. It does not lie buried. It grows. Like a cyst, like a tumor—an offering from the realm to those mad or desperate enough to harvest it. From this grotesque medium, flesh mages sculpt huge and crude humanoid forms, forcing the matter into mockeries of men. Once given form, the constructs are clad in madness-forged armor—jagged ceremonial plates meant more for intimidation than protection.
  
  
The seams across their bodies tell a simple, cruel tale: madness ore continues to sprout even after shaping. When it does, it is torn free to be reforged. And the empty wounds? They are sewn shut without thought, without care. Just flesh, closed like cloth.
  
  
This is the Madness Guard. It does not speak. It does not feel. It stands, in the damp and the dark, watching. Waiting. A sentinel of living madness, patched together by necessity and bound by a silence thicker than the mists of Dementia."*

[/font][font=Times New Roman]**ON AMBER SENTINELS:**[/font]
  
  
[font=Times New Roman]*"In the radiant groves and fever-bright clearings of Mania, where colors pierce sharper than blades and every shadow hides a gleam, there is a guardianship born of resin and dream.*[/font][font=Times New Roman]*Amber, the crystallized lifeblood of Mania’s trees, does not merely harden with age. In the hands of the realm’s artisans—those half-mad sculptors who hear whispers in the sap—it awakens. From this sacred medium, tall and slender forms are coaxed into existence: the Amber Sentinels.*[/font][font=Times New Roman]*Unlike their brutish cousins of Dementia, these guardians are not made for blunt power. Their silhouette is elongated, almost fragile, yet it hides a lethal grace. From the ends of their arms sprout twin blades of pure amber, grown and sharpened into weapons of uncanny precision. They strike not with force, but with speed—each motion deliberate, each cut exact.*[/font][font=Times New Roman]*Silent and unwavering, the Sentinels neither question nor falter. They serve their wardens with a strange enthusiasm, a devotion that borders on joy. In the fever of Mania, where ecstasy and delirium walk hand in hand, they are the vigilant edge—gleaming watchers carved of golden resin, swift as thought and loyal beyond measure.*[/font][font=Times New Roman]*This is the Amber Sentinel. Where Mania blazes, it follows. Where its lords decree, it strikes. And in the endless carnival of the realm, it is both performer and executioner, radiant and merciless alike."*[/font]

TECHNICAL INFO: ﻿This mod adds Madness Guards and Amber Sentinels only as a summon to the player, and the spelltomes can be found, respectively, in a small island north of Yngol Barrow, obtained from the skeletal remains of a Demented Mage killed by a ferocious snow predator, and inside Bruca's Leap Redoubt, obtained from the skeletal remains of a Manic Mage killed by the Forsworn.
  
  
  
**A comment on my decision to finally touch the Creation Club:**I have never hidden my criticisms towards Creation Club, including the very existence of the concept itself. I have nothing against the existence of patreons, since I even have one, and I am also very grateful to the Nexus Donation Points system, but I am absolutely against paywalled mods and any type of sale of add-ons. I believe that mods should forever be free, and available to everyone, which is another reason for me to be critical of CC, since many people around the world cannot afford to buy a good computer that runs SE/AE, and are automatically excluded from these new add-ons, which can be ported to LE with the greatest of ease. I am even more against it when I see the absolute disregard that Bethesda had when analyzing and approving the content of Creation Club, since its implementation was from the beginning lazy at its core, often breaking the immersion, the already pre-established lore, and basically trying to force as canon things that were simply made just to be made and sold, implemented without the slightest effort to make their development at least a little more immersive. There were no voice actors, there were almost no really new models (most of the new models come from TES: Blades), there were no new animations (which the developers could have easily provided and implemented because they had tools in their possession that were not made available alongside the Creation Kit for us) and much more, there was a lack of love, care and respect for the franchise and the community, something that most of us authors have.
  
  
But, after years of being asked by the community to give my touch on how I think this content should be, and after a productive conversation with the people at Extended Cut, who have already worked their magic with the creation of *"Saints and Seducers Extended Cut"*, I decided to give in, no because I like CC, but exactly because I don't like it, and I think it can be improved, without however changing the basis of each add-on too much, so, the objective is to try to make the best version that I think could have been made and that wasn't in each of them, of course respecting the scope that each add-on deserves to have: for example, I will not make 50 caves for *"Goblins"*, since the purpose of the add-on is only to add a specific clan on a specific cave, so, I will be moderate in this overhaul process. In conclusion, I am willing to recognize the Creation Club and its existence as canonical in the general scenario of my mods and their integration, but only when there is an overhaul carried out by me for each creation, or another overhaul that I consider suitable and well done, such as the one from Extended Cut. 
  
  
I hope you like the overhauls (and mods that use parts of the CC content), and support them by endorsing and downloading each one, as well as sharing my mods with people you know.

This mod requires the creation "Saints and Seducers" to be used in SE. On AE the mentioned creation is included on the base game. So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
