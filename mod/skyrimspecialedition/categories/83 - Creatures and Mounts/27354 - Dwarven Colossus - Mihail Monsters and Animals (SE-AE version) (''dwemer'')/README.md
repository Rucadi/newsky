Massive, and with incredible endurance and fire power, these machines possess specialized weapons on their arms, a large dual-blade gauntlet on the right arm and a hammer piston that creates fire pulses on the left one. They are also able to breath extremely destructive fire, and create intense high heat around them, what causes dangerous area burning damage to their enemies. There's only a very few Dwarven Colossus left in the abandoned dwemer dungeons of Skyrim (and possibly they were never even built on a large scale, even in the heyday of the Dwemer), but are commonly reconstructed by Dwarven Steam Constructors when destroyed, in a few weeks. They appear commonly guarding large and important areas, due to their immense size and power."

So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
