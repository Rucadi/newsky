**﻿Why Crystal Mudcrabs?**

  
In a recent expedition to Blackreach, I decided that the place needed a bit of fauna diversity. The endless Falmer, Chaurus, Automatons and that one Giant needed to have a counterpart in the passive category to make it feel a little more like an ecosystem than a deathtrap and thus Crystal Mudcrabs was born.
  
  
  

**What does this mod do?**

  

  
* Adds a new larger variety of mudcrab to Blackreach styled areas with their own creature skeleton file, meshes and textures with relevant loot.
Create a more powerful mudcrab that feels like it could actually survive in the harsh, falmer and chaurus dominant, ecosystem by giving them the tools to fight back when threatened.
  
* Aims to have as many patches as possible to keep the mudcrabs appeased in most load orders (found a conflict, let me know so I can patch it)

  

**What doesn't this mod do?**

  

  
* Overhaul anything in Blackreach.
Edit any vanilla levelled lists, should be compatible with any other creature mods.

**Incompatibilities**

  
  
The only true compatibility problem I could see with this mod is a Blackreach overhaul possibly placing something on the same spot as a mudcrab. If you fid one of these, let me know and I will see about patching it.
