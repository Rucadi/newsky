* [font=Times New Roman]*This mod is a compilation of my Chest Mimics ([LE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/100293)﻿/[SE-AE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27711)﻿) and Black Ooze [i]([LE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/113867)﻿/[SE-A﻿E](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/79287)﻿)* mods. If you use these 2 mods, by downloading this new file you will be able to delete these 2 esps, thus saving space in your load order;[/i][/font]
[font=Times New Roman]*Obviously you should not use this mod together with the 2 mentioned above, since they are already compiled in this new file, and using them at the same time will double the amount of these creatures in your game, in addition to other possible problems;*[/font]

*Now in a single mod, Mimics and Oozes are fearsome and sneaky living traps that lurk in the darkest corners waiting to devour adventurers in search for fame and fortune. With this mod, exploring and looting dungeons will never be a safe experience again.*
  
  
  
*From Chest Mimics page:*
  
  
*"Mimics are a dilemma and a mystery, and no one truly knows their origin or appearance. It's easy to summarize a Mimic: they disguise themselves as chests, waiting for victims to try to open them. When a wretch tries to do so, the Mimic will attack the victim with its long sharp claws and try to bite the poor soul with a large mouth full of sharp teeth, a bite so powerful that it is often described as causing instant death.
  
  
Before revealing its identity, the Mimic resembles a common chest inside a dungeon, but when you touch, or get close enough to the chest, the monster reveals a large hanging tongue and rows of dangerous teeth, followed by slender arms, legs and torso, and once on its feet, the Mimic will begin aggressively chasing its prey. Mimics are fast, tough and deal good damage, they can easily kill the unprepared, and are known for not distinguishing friend or foe.
  
  
It is unknown if the chest is part of them, or if they just possessed a common mundane chest, but due to the countless legends about Mimics possessing other objects, and due to the fact that it is possible to extract from inside their corpses when defeated, a multitude of items usually found in common chests, the last option is probably the most likely.
  
  
They are cunning and sometimes wait disguised near normal chests in order to lure their prey, and only the most discerning adventurer can tell them apart before it's too late, and although their origin, as mentioned, is not exactly known, they are described as extremely abundant in the Shivering Isles, and therefore many attribute their creation to the Daedric Prince of Trickery, Sheogorath."*

Technical info: *"Why does the  Mimic use the vanilla boss-chest model and texture instead of adapting to the chest the player is using?"*- Very simple, Mimic needs to use a specific chest model as it is a custom animated creature model, rigged on a specific set of bones from an animation, applied to the vertices of a specific chest, chosen during the modeling and animation process of the creature, and that is part of it, not being just a detached object that can be replaced. The chest model is the same as the vanilla one, but I applied a 4k re-texture to it, faithful to the original, only more detailed, but you don't notice the difference from afar. I can't let it use whatever texture replacer you're using because I run the risk that you're using a mod that not only changes the texture, but also the model of the vanilla "boss-chest", which would leave the texture in my mimic buggy, for not being made for the model. Also, yes I could make the chest static model before the Mimic reveals itself to be the chest replacer you're using, but then that would make it look one way when static and another when transformed, and that would break your immersion. Remember that I make mods for vanilla, and I'm offering you a 4k version of this chest in Mimic and the ambush versions of the chest. If you use mods that modify chest textures, or even the model, thus making it very easy to know when it's a Mimic and when it's not, you should understand that this, and I say as respectfully as possible, is not my problem, and my duty is to adapt to the vanilla game, not to the individual load order of each one.
  
  
  
*From Black Ooze page:*
  
  
*"Like all types of living slime, the Black Ooze, also known as Black Pudding, is mindless, voracious and extremely dangerous. Unlike most of these, however, this ooze, apparently originating from the Void itself, is not exactly acidic or poisonous, but rather drains its victims' vital and magical attributes by acting as a kind of life/existence-sucking energetic vortex.**Amorphous, bubbly, generally medium in size and black in color like some kind of ink, this ooze can be found crawling among the uneven floors and walls of ancient ruins and caves occupied by practitioners of heavy dark magic. In Oblivion they are found in various dark realms, such as Coldharbour, as well as the realms of Namira, Vaermina and even the Shivering Isles, always ready to ambush an unsuspecting victim. Furthermore, there are reports that they crawl through the ruins and dead soil of Soul Cairn, feeding on the feelings of the desperate souls that roam there.**Like all creatures of the Void, the Black Oozes are energetic vortices that suck everything positive around them, not just physical vitality, but also mental energy, happiness and magic. The Void or Ancient Darkness is beyond the known realms and written history, and at the same time is an important part of them. It is the absolute stagnation, the static emptiness, which tries to suck up everything that tries to differentiate itself in the midst of it. It is the concept of non-being, non-existence, the end of all things, the path of no return, and every entity that manifests itself in the universe of movement as a herald of this Void, carries with it the same energy of anti- life, and functions as a macabre vortex to this realm of death.**Black Oozes react negatively to light and fire spells, and these are the best solution to avoid engaging in direct combat with them, as contamination with their mucus not only quickly drains vitality, but also due to its viscosity it greatly reduces the victim's mobility, making very difficult to escape the contamination of an attacking Black Ooze."*by Beastmaster Mihail \*

So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
