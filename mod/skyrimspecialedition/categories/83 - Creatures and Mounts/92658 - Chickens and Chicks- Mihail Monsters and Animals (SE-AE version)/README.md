* [font=Times New Roman]*This mod is a compilation of my Chicken Replacer ([LE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/113302)﻿/[SE-AE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76452)﻿), More Chicken Variants [i]([LE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/113851)﻿/[SE-A﻿E](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/79241)﻿)* and Chicks ([LE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/114635)﻿/[SE-AE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/84110)﻿) mods. If you use these 3 mods, by downloading this new file you will be able to delete their 2 esps (one of them has no .esp), thus saving space in your load order;[/i][/font]
[font=Times New Roman]*Obviously you should not use this mod together with the 3 mentioned above, since they are already compiled in this new file, and using them at the same time will double the amount of these creatures in your game, in addition to other possible problems;*[/font]

I've worked hard for years to offer you the best of me for free, and the only thing I ask in return is this gesture, which increases my relevance and engagement on Nexus, and motivates me to continue;[/font]*
[font=Times New Roman]*I do not inspect or have any influence over translations of my mods (including those linked directly on my pages), nor do I have any power over patches or add-ons made to my content. So, before using any unofficial add-ons for my mods, make sure they conform to the latest version of my official release, and never use these if they don't. The same applies to Xbox ports;*[/font]

*All Mihail's chicken and chick mods compiled in one esp. Replace the ugly vanilla chickens and even add new color varieties, plus adorable chicks following them around.*
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/XwFuxsS.png)*![](https://i.imgur.com/wzp80kw.jpg)**- ﻿**﻿**This mod offers a new highly detailed model, 4k texture and 2k normal maps for Skyrim's vanilla chickens, originally released in a low quality model and using textures with a very low resolution of 256 x 256, making the chickens ugly, dated and blurry (as seen in the comparative images in this description). Due to the poor quality of the model, a detailed re-texture of it was never possible, so I decided not only to bring a new texture, but also to make a completely new model, adapted to the current Skyrim modding standards.**This mod not only stays true to the original concept, but makes the chicken's appearance even better embedded in the overall Skyrim setting.*

﻿- The loadscreen sometimes displayed when traveling to Whiterun and surroundings, showing several chickens around a wooden crate, has also been replaced with a new one using the new model; *(image bellow)*

*- The mod also expands the Chicken presence by adding 5 more high quality variants of chickens to the game, with highly detailed models, 4k textures and 2k normal maps. The new variants are scattered around the world along with the vanilla chickens replaced by this mod; (image bellow)*

- It also adds another extra touch of realism to your game by adding little chicks to Skyrim's farms, villages and chicken coops as well, following their mothers around. *(image bellow)*

The mod is not compatible with other mods that modify the textures or model of vanilla Chickens. If you have one installed, or think you might have one, put this mod below it/them in your load order. If you are asked about files overwriting those of other mods, press "Yes to all".
  
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
