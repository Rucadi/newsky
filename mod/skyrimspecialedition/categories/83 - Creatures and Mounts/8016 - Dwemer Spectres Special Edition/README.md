Throughout Morrowind, they walked the shades of a once-great race. These Dwemer spectres haunted ruins all across Vvardenfell forever guarding their puzzles and treasures. Yet, curiously, their presence was absent from Skyrim. But no more. Once again, these spirits walk through their halls, annihilating any traveler foolish enough to cross their paths.
  
  
*Dwemer Spectres*, as the name suggests, adds Dwemer spectres from Morrowind back into Skyrim. Unlike the previous game, however, they have a bit more going on with them, with multiple types and stronger versions appearing at higher levels.
  
On top of that, unique spectre bosses are scattered throughout remote ruins. These haunts are far more powerful than their generic counterparts, but in return drop gears (and fabulous treasure, but mostly gears).
  
  
  
**Features**
  

  
* Five types of Dwemer spectres: guards, engineers, mages, crossbowmer, and Tonal Architects.
New spells and attacks for these spectres. Watch as they pelt you with gears, summon centurions to aid them, and employ fabulous contraptions to tear holes in spacetime and chop you into bits.
  
* Seven unique spectre bosses, dispersed throughout Dwarven ruins, waiting to kill you.
Seven unique rewards dropped from these bosses, with unique enchantments and abilities.
  
* A secret reward and quest for those who manage to find and fight all the unique bosses.
Stupid-looking hats
  
* Over 315 gears

  

  
* Dwemer spectres will first start appearing around level 8. The highest level ones, the Tonal Architects, will begin to appear around level 35.
Bosses can be found at any time, though be aware they are quite strong (about the same strength as a Dragon Priest).

**Installation**

  
* Use your Vortex or Mod Organizer 2 (recommended), another mod manager, or drop the contents of the zip into your data folder.

  
  
**Compatibility and Troubleshooting**

  
* This mod modifies the template NPCs for Dwemer spiders and sphere automatons It is an edit directly to their base NPC records and effects what kind of NPC will spawn in its place. We don't know of any mods that modify this, but you should check in SSEEdit to be sure.
**An old version of this mod is included in "Immersive Creatures."** You cannot use both mods at the same time. We also generally advise against the use of Immersive Creatures because it is an older mod with several implementation problems that have not been fixed.
  
* Though we use the assets from "Dwemer Beards Special Edition," the two mods should still be compatible. If you wish to have playable Dwemer beards, you will need to download the mod [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40680)﻿.
