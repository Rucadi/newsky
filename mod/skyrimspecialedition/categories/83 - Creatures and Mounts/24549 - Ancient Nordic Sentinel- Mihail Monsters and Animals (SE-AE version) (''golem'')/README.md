"Foundation Stone Golems are constructions made from the architecture of ruins, catacombs and temples. Specifically, the Ancient Nordic Sentinels are gigantic golems built by piecing together blocks of ancient Nordic ruins to form a vaguely humanoid titanic form. The power to unite and animate the stone and metal pieces to form a huge mighty autonomous being came from a powerful mage, commonly a Dragon Priest. The soul that inhabits and controls the golem is nor daedra or aedra, but the soul of a great ancient Norse warrior who died in battle ages ago, and now animates the colossal stone construction. The skull that the golem carries on the pedestal on his chest belongs to the skeletal remains of the warrior himself, being the last physical remnant of his former body.
  
  
They are apparently imbued with the ancient power of the Thu'um. Despite not using shouts directly in combat, the mere entrance of one of them into alert mode causes great instability in the skies, comparable to the most powerful shouts of the mighty Norse warriors of the past, who were able to control the weather and cause gales and storms with their voices.
  
  
These constructs and their methods of creation were in the exclusive domain of really powerful mages with specific arcane methods now lost in time, extinct like the Dragon Cult that spawned them. Due to that fact, Ancient Nordic Sentinels can be usually only found guarding the exterior of specific ancient dungeons of special importance, commonly the resting places of especially powerful Dragon Priests, and not being produced in recent ages for more generic functions. Every Colossi still in existence is a rarity, and after its destruction, one more step will be taken towards the total annihilation of this type of ancient construct."

So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
