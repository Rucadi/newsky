They don’t need to cast spells to charm you, one “meow” is enough to throw off your emotional Magicka bar. Born of fire, lightning, and ice, they prove that even the elements can purr.**From Honi, the Frost Atronach Cat page:**"Honi was the faithful cat companion of the now deceased conjurer Rhorald, and his most beloved friend. When he died,
  
his owner conjured a magical body of ice for him, where he placed his soul, so that Honi would remain by his side forever.
  
Now Honi is looking for a new friend to follow on magical adventures across Tamriel.
  
  
Fulfill the wizard Rhorald's last wish, and be that friend. Honi may not be the bravest of warriors,
  
but he undoubtedly has a lot of love to give to his new caregiver, despite his literally frozen heart."**From Joh'ri, the Storm Atronach Cat page:**"Joh'ri was the female atronach cat given as a gift by the late court wizard of Dawnstar to her granddaughter when the latter was a small child. As the granddaughter grew older she lost interest in her "toy", and the cat was forgotten. It is up to you to be her new partner.
  
  
Many years ago, the old witch found a female dying cat after a particularly cold night in Dawnstar, captured its soul, and created an elemental storm atronach body for it. At first, her granddaughter loved the gift, but as the child grew older, she found other interests. The mage would still summon the animal from time to time, but as time went by, and as she approached the last year of her life, the pet was forgotten, and the mage retired from the court, and soon died.
  
  
The spelltome can be found on a dusty shelf in the chambers of Dawnstar's current court wizard,
  
Madena, inside the "The White Hall", and can be taken without it being considered theft."**From Igni, the Fire Atronach Cat page:**"﻿**Igni was the temperamental but loyal cat of the witch Ulrlith, and her faithful companion for many decades. Once a common cat, upon his death his soul was transferred to an elemental body that allowed him to remain by his owner's side for some time longer. When she died, he was left as an inheritance to her grandson, Radalf, a young man not at all inclined towards magic. However, when he tried one day to summon the cat to reconcile with him, following the instructions in the inherited magic book, the results were less than perfect.
  
  
The conjuration indeed worked, Igni was summoned and, thinking it was his owner who called him to Mundus again, quickly rolled over on his back, expecting some affection. But, the cat immediately recognized Radalf as the mischievous child who had bothered him when he was still a common cat, more than 20 years ago, and as if that was not enough, the naive Radalf, forgetting about the unpleasant past between the two, tried to pet the exposed cat's belly.
  
  
Now, it is already a great danger to risk such an irresistible action on a cat of flesh and blood, let alone to do it on a cat of flaming molten iron, especially without using any protection or alteration spell. The lack of magical protection and the fury of the feline upon seeing his old nemesis again, caused an accidental pyromantic reaction that in seconds incinerated the entire young man when he touched the irresistible belly of the flaming cat, leaving only a burned corpse behind, and Igni once again without a home."*[/font][/left][left][font=Times New Roman]![](https://i.imgur.com/XwFuxsS.png)

Joh'ri, the Storm Atronach Cat;
  
Igni, the Fire Atronach Cat;[/font][/left]*[font=Times New Roman](the 3 are flagged as invulnerable and essential and cannot be damaged or killed. Elemental Cats' AI is programmed for them to
  
seek a safe place during combat, not participating in any type of conflict, and not having offensive capabilities)

The spell is permanent, only dissipating if you summon another creature)*Summon Igni, the Fire Cat;

- 2 new world objects: 
  
Rhorald Remains; 
  
*(in the outer area of ​​Hag's End, before crossing the first bridge, access the tower
  
on the right. The skeleton is on the third floor, next to a chest covered in snow)*Burnt Corpse (Radalf 's remains); 
  
*(in the vanilla unmarked location Horker Standing Stones, northeast of High Gate Ruins, on a small island
  
with Nordic ruins. The burnt corpse is on the center of the area holding the spell tome, bellow a ruined arch)*- 1 new book: Rhorald's Last Wish;
  
***(full text bellow:****"If someone with a good heart finds this journal, please make my last wish come true. I am Rhorald, a conjuration enthusiast, I am not a necromancer, nor do I have any bad intentions, just a thirst for knowledge, which led me to seek and dialogue with the inhabitants of Oblivion.**I had as my faithful companion my sweet cat Honi, who passed away of old age 3 years ago. I couldn't deal with the loss, he was my only company, for nights and nights on end while I unraveled the ritualistic mysteries of conjuration, he curled up in my lap while purring. I miss him the most...**Knowing that other conjurers create Frost Atronachs in the shape of animals, I used all my knowledge to create an ice construct in the shape of a cat, and connected Honi's soul to it. After the ritual was complete, I burst into tears as I saw the form rise from the table, shake itself, look in my direction and meow... Honi was back, and now forever, death would no longer take him from me!**Because he was under enchantment, I managed to prevent his ice from burning me, or melting in the heat, but I noticed that he now felt an intrinsic need to spend part of his time on the plane from where I conjured the magical ice that forms him. It's where most Frost Atronachs live and come from, so Honi's time with me has now been cut in half, which is still better than nothing.**While seeking to cross the Reach, accompanied by my faithful squire, we were ambushed by Forsworns, who brought me into the presence of their loathsome Hagraven matrons. I believe that my end is approaching, but I hope that someone can find Honi and have him as a good companion on magical and challenging adventures.**When I was about to be captured, I unsummoned Honi, sending him back to the safety of Oblivion, but I'm afraid they'll find the spelltome and bring him back to harm him or worse. I can't get rid of the book yet, because I still use it during my rituals, as I'm still in the learning process.**As I was taken to the sacrificial altar, I managed to free myself and ran, but the exit from this place is guarded by Forsworns, who take turns at their positions, so I don't know if I will be able to escape. I am very injured, as I have undergone several painful and invasive procedures that drained part of my blood and left me with deep cuts, and I feel feverish, with my strength diluting like ice melting in the sun.**I hid in the ruins, probably waiting for my death to come, my hope is running out, but I still hope whoever finds my remains has a good heart. Please take care of Honi, he doesn't like combat, and will probably run away if a fight breaks out, but he's a good boy, I promise.**Please take care of the being I loved the most,**Rhorald")*

(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)
