I always liked the look of the Sphere and Spider Animunculi in ESO. I waited years for someone to try and remake them, but it never happened. I then played the Legends of Aetherium mod, and felt that it would be a complete natural for those Dwemer Animunculi to be ESO style. So I decided to make them myself.
  
  
  I used the base game assets, and pictures I found online. All added parts are from the base game, just twisted to do something new. I also dropped the Sphere centurion mesh into 3DSMax, and did some tweaking of the head. I made it narrower at the top, just like the ones in ESO. I then decided to make them a bit more mean looking, so gently pulled down the brow line to give an angry appearance. The dividing line mesh of the face was nearly removed as well. I then found what I could use as the crest, and changed the sword to an axe. All the animations work just as they should, and even when the sphere is all folded into a ball, the head crest rests like the ones in ESO. 
  
  
  The spider was more difficult, as I had to bend and reshape various part to get the result I wanted. It turned out be something between what we got in Skyrim and what is available in ESO, so something in between. But it gives the game a fresh look and feel. The spiders movements are a bit different, almost more intelligent looking now.
  
  
  As always with a mod like this, there could be strange things happen, but I have been playing with them as replacements for a couple of months now and think I have fixed most little bugs. The spiders went through a slight redesign due to a dismember issue. I removed the offending part and that fixed it.
  
  
 There are meshes included to replace all in game variants, animated models, static meshes, trophies, and even the load screens have been changed. All meshed have collision, that way any mod that might use the statics and load screen assets in other mods will have collision. I also plan to release a plugin for the Legends of Aetherium mod. Still need to make a few tweaks.
  
  
Oh, and although the mod is tagged for Anniversary, its 100% compatible with old Skyrim SE as they never touched the meshes I built these from and they have no CC content in them. 
  
  
 For those that remember past mods from me, I have been away from modding Skyrim for nearly three years, real life issues got in the way , an not being able to use my desktop computer the main reason. Such is the life of an old X-gen guy.
