*"Even the smallest and most harmless fish of the Shivering Isles embody the strangeness and insanity of their creator, and fall prey to it. Whether they were created by a simple egocentric whim of Sheogorath, or even to kindly fulfill a request from his subordinates, it is questionable whether these fish truly appreciate the mutations they have undergone against their will.
  
  
﻿The origin of Veiltail Lobsterfishes is surprisingly associated with a spontaneous and prank-free act of kindness. Sheogorath, at the request of a group of madmen recently arrived from Cyrodiil, transformed a small type of veilfish, a critter extremely abundant in the island's shallow waters, into a new type of fish that has a flavor and consistency similar to lobster, a delicacy that these residents lacked, accustomed to pompous lobsters at their parties on the imperial province. Now they had a fish that was easy to catch, abundant and living in shallow waters, with an even better flavor than those crustaceans that live in deep waters difficult to acess.
  
  
The case of the poor Emean Triclops is quite different however. While visiting the Emean Sea, the ocean surrounding the islands, Sheogorath came face to face with a naïve simple pufferfish, which did what pufferfishes do when frightened: it inflated itself to appear bigger and ward off its would-be predator, not knowing in its limited mind that the intruder was Sheogorath, and its lord and lord of everything around him. Enraged by the little fish's lack of courtesy and respect, Sheogorath cursed him and all of his kind with a third central eye, which functions as a magnifying glass. Now, any object, even a distant one, is brought closer, enlarged and distorted, appearing to be threateningly too near to the fish, causing them to live in constant panic, and therefore constantly inflated.
  
  
Telvanni mages have developed a special liking for these two species, having successfully migrated some to Morrowind, where they breed them near their towers, and consume them as delicacies. As several animals of the Shivering Isles appear to have had their origins on Nirn, it is possible that Dunmer wizards simply reverted their animus back to its original form, rather than simply maintaining colonies of daedra fish bound on Nirn."*[/font][left][/left][left][font=Times New Roman]**by Beastmaster Mihail \***

So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.[/font][/left][left][font=Times New Roman](OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
