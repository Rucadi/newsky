*![](https://i.imgur.com/PwJxVUw.png)**"*[/font]*[font=Times New Roman]Werewolf Behemoths are towering, musclebound lycanthropes—creatures of immense size and raw power, far beyond the common werewolf. While some are believed to have reached this state naturally through brutal survival and the favor of Hircine, many are the result of arcane augmentation. Hagravens are known to magically enhance lycanthropes, creating these monstrous guardians to serve as bodyguards or enforcers for the Forsworn. In battle, they combine the savagery of the Hunt with unnatural strength, becoming nightmarish emissaries of the Daedric Prince of the Wilds.[/font]*[font=Times New Roman]*"*

A former monster hunter, now a dedicated scholar, he is planned to be released as an NPC in late 2022/early 2023, doing the same job in-game as my descriptions do on Nexus.)
  
  
  
***Technical details:**Werewolf Behemoths only start appearing after lvl. 35,
  
and in some specific locations only after the player reaches lvl. 45.*

So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
