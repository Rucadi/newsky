*![](https://i.imgur.com/PwJxVUw.png)**Geese have finally come to Skyrim—not as bloodthirsty monsters (for once), but as harmless (yet deeply judgmental) creatures. They’ll waddle through villages, honk disapprovingly at your fashion choices, and grace the land with their awkward majesty. Enjoy their peaceful presence… while it lasts.*

So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
