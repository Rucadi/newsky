Dragon War has always been a mod I wanted to make, something that let me still being surprised when I fight a dragon. Working on creatures, especially on dragons, has been very, very difficult because very little can be done, not to mention how easy is to breaking stuff or to make them insanely strong. So I hope Dragon War can be of your liking, and that you can enjoy it.

Progression has been adjusted so that the player will encounter high level dragons earlier than usual. Accordingly, the pace of the main quest pace has also been adjusted, and it is suggested to start Dragon Rising at least at level 5. To make it feel consistent, "Frost Dragon" has been renamed into "Mystic Dragon", and Revered and Serpentine dragons have been removed from world encounters, as now they are respectively unique to Forgotten Vale and Apocrypha.

World Encounters
  
Dragons regularly start to appear after Dragon Rising is completed, and will become stronger as the player levels up.
  
  
**Dragon** - Starting from Dragon Rising completion
  
**Blood Dragon** - Starting from level 10
  
**Mystic Dragon** - Starting from level 20
  
**Elder Dragon** - Starting from level 30
  
**Ancient Dragon** - Starting from level 40
  
**Legendary Dragon** - Starting from level 50
  
  
Dragon Lairs & Mounds
  
Despite using the same list as the world encounters, dragons spawned from lairs and mounds work a bit differently, as they are affected by Encounter Zones, so the encounters can easily get more difficult.

Unlike vanilla, it's possible to encounter dragons of four different elements, such as Fire, Frost, Shock and Poison, and very few can come with two of them. Two extra elements — Sun and Coldfire — are only available to unique dragons. Each dragon type has unique resistance and weakness, but still share some properties between them, and their strength and shouts variety is determined by their level and appearance. Dragons are very hard foes, and the improved AI and their new attacks make them a real and consistent threat — both in flight and on ground — to not underestimate and to adequately prepare against. Their breaths are capable of creating elemental walls which can be a problem for your mobility, and their unarmed attacks can both inflict bleeding and huge physical damage.

Most of players find fighting a dragon frustrating at best, so to limit this, dragon injury system has been improved, and two more injuries got added.
  
  
 • **Health Injury** - Dragons are forced to stay on ground when their Health falls below 25%.
  
 • **Magicka Injury** - Dragons Shouts Cooldown is increased by 50% when their Magicka falls below 25%.
  
 • **Stamina Injury** - Dragons physical damage is reduced by 50% when their Stamina falls below 25%.

When it comes to kill a dragon, the most exciting part is the reward. Taken the difficulty, improving the loot with some good addition is the right choice. If this is still not enough, I suggest to take a look at [Dragon Hunting.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99193)
