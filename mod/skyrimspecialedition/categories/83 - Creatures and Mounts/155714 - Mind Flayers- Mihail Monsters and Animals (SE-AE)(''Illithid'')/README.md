*![](https://i.imgur.com/PwJxVUw.png)**"**Shrouded in speculation, the arrival of the Illithids in Apocrypha is a mystery cloaked in ink and whispers. Some believe they slipped through the folds of reality, cast out from a foreign realm of psionic empires. Others claim they were born there—spontaneous manifestations of Apocrypha’s endless hunger for minds.**The most accepted theory suggests that the Illithids once dwelled in lesser realms of Oblivion, strange and half-submerged dominions where thought and flesh intertwined. These realms—now largely forgotten—are said to share abyssal, sunken borders with the deepest layers of Apocrypha. In those hidden depths, traditional ceremorphosis was practiced through tadpoles, which gestated in hosts until full mental overwrite occurred. It was only upon crossing into Apocrypha that their nature was altered—reconstructed to suit the realm’s hunger for secrets rather than domination.**In appearance, they are unmistakable: tall, robed figures cloaked in ornate green and gold patterns. Their skin is taut and grayish, stretched over an elongated skull devoid of visible ears or nose. From where a mouth might be, a cluster of long, fleshy tentacles extends downward like living quills. Their eyes glow a deep, unnatural green, pulsing faintly with unreadable intent, as if peering not at you—but through you. They move slowly, deliberately, as if each motion were dictated by thought rather than instinct.**Whatever their origin, the Illithids now serve a higher order adapted to this realm’s alien logic. They remain tethered to their Elder Brains, vast and ancient synaptic cores pulsating within bio-ink cysts buried deep in the memory-mines of Apocrypha. But their transformation under Hermaeus Mora is undeniable:**Ceremorphosis now begins not with tadpoles, but with scrollspawn—larvae that gestate in cursed tomes and hatch into minds through reading alone. Victims are rewritten, neuron by neuron, until they emerge as new vessels of ink, tentacles, and stolen thought.**Their colonies are labyrinths of flesh-script and dripping parchment, grown from the ruins of forgotten libraries. Thought-leeches hang from vaulted ceilings. Black Books line the walls—not as artifacts, but as organs.**No longer concerned with conquest alone, these Illithids hunger for forbidden cognition. Each mind devoured feeds not just the Elder Brain, but Apocrypha itself. Each stolen secret helps decode the unknowable will of Mora.**Their psionic abilities are reshaped by the realm—dreams calcify into weapons, and memories manifest as corrosive echoes. Their allegiance is still to their hive intelligence... but their purpose now lies deeper, drowned beneath layers of secrecy and mutation.**They are Mind Flayers still—yet not as mortals imagine them.
  
  
They are the Inkborn, the Scrolltainted, the Neural Apostles of Hermaeus Mora.**They do not seek to enslave the world.**They seek to rewrite it.**"*

So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
