* [font=Times New Roman]*This mod is the standalone version of the Mammoth Calf, originally released[i] in my Mammoth Expansion mod ([LE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/81645)﻿ / [SE-AE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69391)﻿). If you have the mentioned mod installed, you already have the Mammoth Calf in your game and you don't need to download this mod which only adds the mentioned creature and no other creatures contained in the original mod;*[/i][/font]
[font=Times New Roman]*Obviously you should not use this mod together with the Mammoth Expansion mod mentioned above, since the latter already adds Mammoth Calfs to your game, and using them at the same time will double the amount of the mentioned creature in your game, in addition to other possible problems;*[/font]

I've worked hard for years to offer you the best of me for free, and the only thing I ask in return is this gesture, which increases my relevance and engagement on Nexus, and motivates me to continue;[/font]*
[font=Times New Roman]*I do not inspect or have any influence over translations of my mods (including those linked directly on my pages), nor do I have any power over patches or add-ons made to my content. So, before using any unofficial add-ons for my mods, make sure they conform to the latest version of my official release, and never use these if they don't. The same applies to Xbox ports;*[/font]

(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
