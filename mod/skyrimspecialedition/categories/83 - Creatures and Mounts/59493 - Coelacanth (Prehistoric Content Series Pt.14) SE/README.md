[font=Comic Sans MS]Coelacanths are elusive ancient fish that have been around since the Dawn Era. Most scholars have only found them in fossil records and believe they were extinct until recent times. They are deep-sea fish and like to hide among underwater caves, crevices, rock cliffs, and steep rocky slopes of volcanic areas. and even among seaweed/kelp vegetation. Most of them hail from Morrowind and have traveled up Solstheim and northeastern Skyrim.
  
  
The taste of Colecanth is reported to be awful and most people don't eat them, not even other fish-eating animals. High amounts of oil, urea, wax esters, slime, and other compounds give them a foul flavor and can cause sickness. No one except the Reikling tribes has found a way to eat them regularly without getting sick. Perhaps they have a scrap paper stashed somewhere that shows the recipe for preparing Coelacanths.[/font]
