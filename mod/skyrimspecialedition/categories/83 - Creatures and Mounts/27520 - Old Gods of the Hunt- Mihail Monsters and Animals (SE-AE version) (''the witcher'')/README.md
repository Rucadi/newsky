***"The Wild Hunt is a pack of shifting forest-demons and animal-gods, thousands strong, 
  
which sweeps through the countryside killing everything its path." 
  
— Eric of Guis*
  
  
*"A flood of horrific beasts, tentacled toads, insects of armor and spine, gelatinous serpents, vaporous
  
beings with the face of gods, all poured forth from the great hollow tree, blind with fury."*
  
*— A Dance in Fire, chapter 4**"The Wild Hunt is a magical trait innate to all Bosmer. It is brought on by a collective ritual performed by many Bosmer, causing them to shapeshift into a horde of feral, supernatural beasts. These monsters stampede, changing their form constantly, slaying and devouring all in their path and eventually, when left with no surviving targets, turn upon themselves in a "cannibalistic orgy". This transformation is seen by the Bosmer as a return to the chaos of the Dawn Era, when they were unable to hold onto one shape for more than a moment. After they made the Green Pact with Y'ffre, he taught the Bosmer how to escape that chaos and retain their form, but also how to return to it by instigating the Wild Hunt. These shapeshifters are said to be able to take on a gaseous form which makes them impossible to contain without the aid of magic. There's even some suggestion they can take on the form of water.
  
The purpose of the Wild Hunt varies with each separate Hunt, from an act of vengeance to a tool of war. In either case, the Bosmer are not proud of their ability and are unwilling to discuss the Hunt at great length. One of the rare accounts on the nature of the Wild Hunt states that "every monster in the world that has ever been comes from a previous Hunt". As such, the Bosmer are reluctant to use the Hunt, except as an act of desperation. The monsters that do get created by a Wild Hunt, all former Bosmer, are said to be ferocious and long-lived. Notable examples included Willy the Bitten and King Dead Wolf-Deer, who were created by the end of the fourth century of the First Era and lived at least until the beginning of the Third Era. They went on to plague Silvenar Grove and the Lympan March respectively. The change is said to be irreversible."*

"The Old Gods of the Hunt, also known as Ancient Leshens by the Nordic people, are powerfull beings summoned by a previous and ancient Wild Hunt, and that still roam through Tamrielic deep forests and caves in very small numbers in the current era, some speculate that they are even older than that, being creatures that existed since before the Green Pact between the Bosmer and Y'ffre. Ferocious and stunning powerfull, this Wild Hunt beasts are connected to Hircine, and consequently with the Path of the Hunt, the nature, the wildlife, and the Reachmen and Bosmer, who worshiped them since the beginning as one of their Old Gods. Nonetheless, Nord hunters say that they are just legends and scary children stories, but the Bosmer and the Reachmen who live in Skyrim know what horrible power is hidding in the deep dark woods of the cold province.
  
  
This mighty beings are able to call for wild predators to aid them in combat, also infusing part of their power on them. They are also capable of summoning powered familiars, control flocks of crows, spit swarms of glowing dangerous insects, control the woodland wind in order to create gusts, turn invisible, raise giant dread roots from the ground to whip their victims, and obviously attack with their sharp wooden claws, that drain the victims strenght. The primal furious power of these beasts is so incomprehensible and magnanimous in their magical range,
  
that their blows are sometimes able to break the boundaries of reality itself, distorting time and space.
  
  
In Falkreath Hold there is a legend about one of them, a protector of the pine forest, known by the people just as Woodland Spirit. The past generations that lived on Haafingar told stories about a group of Reachmen that worshiped what they called simply Old God of the Hunt, inside a giant grove on the woods. Other legends do exist of others of their kind living inside giant forest-covered caves in the province, so, one should be aware while exploring the deep woodlands.
  
  
On rare documented occasions, Reachmen and Druids have tried to replicate the Wild Hunt transformation that legends say gave rise to these magnanimous creatures. A completely successfull transformation in current times is not yet known to have been achieved, but some Briarheart Forsworns and High Druids have managed to transform themselves in a weaker form of these beasts, what scholars known just as Leshens."

So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
