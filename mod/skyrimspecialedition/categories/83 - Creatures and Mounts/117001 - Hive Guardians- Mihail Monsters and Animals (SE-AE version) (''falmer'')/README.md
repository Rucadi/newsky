*﻿Bundle that breathes new life into the Falmer hives, adding a new mounted Falmer variant, as well as ritualistically modified Chaurus, a new type of animal and a complete overhaul of the vanilla Shellbugs.**From Falmer Abyssraiders description page:**"**Well-armored Falmers, wielding long halberds made of Chaurus chitin and imbued with electricity, riding bulky Pitroamers, the Abyssraiders are a menace in every Falmer hive they patrol.
  
  
Their mounts, the strange-looking Pitroamers, are a type of terrestrial cetacean native to caves and deep tunnels. Their closest relatives are the Orcas, with which they share some physical similarities, the most obvious being the shape of the head, of disproportionate size to their bodies in the Pitroamer's case. They have 2 pairs of tendrils on their chins that they use to detect vibrations produced by underground worms. They are bulky and strong creatures, and are used by Falmers for a number of tasks, commonly as mounts for patrolling, when they are also equipped with pieces of chitinous armor like their masters.**Despite having poor vision, due to their keen sense of smell and ability to widely perceive ground vibrations, they are often used to hunt and track intruders, using their fierce claws, teeth and powerful charge to destroy them.**The Falmers riding these beasts are remarkably good fighters, their double-sided halberds are long and enchanted with magic imbued in them by the Falmer Shamans. They wear light chitin armor, similar to that of most Falmer, but their helms have a large pair of antennae protruding from the forehead, unusual in traditionally worn helms.**There are reports of Falmers riding albino Pitroamers, but given the rarity of such creature, these riders are believed to be rare occurrences as well."*

**On Thri- Kreen Warriors:**
  
  
*"﻿Thri-Kreen are mutated ritualistic warriors created by Falmer alchemy using the Chaurus creature as a base. These obedient humanoid insects outperform the own Falmers in physical capacities, and do not need to rest, being excellent defenders of the hives where they live, despite retaining the same intelligence as a common Chaurus. Although little studied, the magical and alchemical abilities of Falmers are known to other races, not only animating animal forms from fungus, such as the famous Gloomspore beasts, which can be used as a mount, but also mutating the animal life they domesticate, especially the Chaurus.
  
  
The family to which Chaurus belong is vast, including other insects like Shellbugs and Cave Stingers, but Chaurus are the most widely used by the Falmer. Almost everything in Falmer culture is produced from the chitin of the members of this family, from houses to vases, bridges to armor, in addition, they are also a source of food, and guard dogs. When an adult Chaurus approaches the end of its life, it undergoes a metamorphosis, in which, after days locked in a cocoon,the Chaurus emerges as a fearsome flying insect known by the name of Chaurus Hunter. Falmer Shamans developed techniques to alter the process of metamorphosis that occurs within the cocoon, causing some of that Chaurus to assume a tall, slender and humanoid shape, which the Shamans named as the Thri-Kreen Warrior, a name that has an unknown meaning for scholars, but appears to be phonetically similar to the sound that insectoids make. These warriors are given a long double-ended halberd, and are used in protective functions.*
  
*A Thri-Kreen is about 2 meters high, and has a reinforced exoskeleton over its entire body. The creatures have six limbs protruding from their thorax: two for walking and four for use as arms, ending in two-fingered claw-like hands capable of tool and weapon use. Their insectoid heads have 2 green, multi-faceted compound eyes; four long antennae sprouting from the top; and a complex jaw structure with multiple large sharp mandibles. The carapace of a Thri-Kreen is typically darker than the one of a common Chaurus, and they wear no clothing or armor. 
  
  
Thri-Kreen have superior physical abilities compared to a Falmer, or human, with higher strength and great agility. They are faster on their feet and quick enough to deflect or dodge an incoming attack or magical projectile. Their carapace is naturally armored, being tough and resistant to impact, and its dark-blue color make excelent camouflage in the dark caves where they live.  They secrete a dark green poison from their mouths, producing dangerous venomous spits. They can see in the dark through their special eyes, and do not need to sleep at all, , being able to patrol the hives continuously and tirelessly."*

**On Shellbugs:**
  
  
*"Shellbugs are large, round harmless insectoids. As Falmer hives are difficult to explore, for obvious reasons, little is known about the life cycle of these creatures, as they are very rarely found beyond the reach of the blind elves' protective eyes, excuse the irony. It is known, however, that adults are heavy and immobile animals, and it is not yet known if they are somehow attached to the ground, or just decide to live immobile, or even if they are no longer, or never were, able to move, for example, due to their massive weight or because they have lost locomotive structures such as legs, or never had them from the beginning.
  
  
What you see when you come across a Shellbug, is just a large immobile and hard carapace of chitin, round in shape, and a thick head and neck that move slowly, like a turtle, with 4 antennae in the snout region, and several pairs of eyes. They occur in various sizes, both in Falmer hives inside caves, and in the mysterious underworld of Blackreach, but always protected by the Falmer. They are much prized by these fallen elves, who use their chitin to craft armor, among other items, and turn their oval shells into tents when they die. Commonly the protection of these helpless Shellbugs is done by Thri-Kreen Warriors, or 1 or 2 Falmer sentinels, in points relatively distant from the center of activity of the hive, since apparently they develop better and prefer to live in isolated places, instead of surrounded by noisy Falmer and Chaurus.

*From Pitroamers description page:*
  
*"**Pitroamers are a type of terrestrial cetacean that can be found in deep caves, feeding on larvae, mushrooms and roots, but they also eat smaller mammals that they manage to prey on, such as rats or skeevers.
  
  
Their closest relatives are the Orcas, with which they share some physical similarities, the most obvious being the shape of the head. They have an oily skin devoid of fur, and 2 pairs of tendrils on their chins that they use to detect vibrations produced by worms underground.
  
  
Falmer are known to tame and ride Pitroamers, which they use to patrol their hives. Pitroamers are fast animals despite their stout build and less than graceful gait, and their strong bite can do considerable damage.
  
  
They are hardly found close to the surface, with the exception of the domesticated ones brought by the Falmer to shallower hives. In places like Blackreach, and other remote ancient caves, it is still possible to find Pitroamers in the wild, grazing in fields of luminescent mushrooms."*[size=3]**by Beastmaster Mihail \***

[/font][font=Times New Roman]The mod is not compatible with other mods that modify the textures or model of vanilla Shellbugs. If you have one installed, or think you might have one, put this mod below it/them in your load order. If you are asked about files overwriting those of other mods, press "Yes to all".[/font][font=Times New Roman]
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.

Some assets used on this mod belong to:
  
[Vicn-](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3863233?tab=user+files)in order to save time, i used his vanilla falmer re-modeled by him into the model pose of the vanilla riekling as base to my falmer animated as riekling boar-rider, since the initial model pose is basically the same, just with different positioning and other minor necessary tweaks;
