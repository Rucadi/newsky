* [font=Times New Roman][size=4]*If you use, like and value my work, please consider giving an endorsement. I've worked hard for years to offer you the best of me for free, and the only thing I ask in return is this gesture, which increases my relevance and engagement on Nexus, and motivates me to continue;*[/font]
  
[font=Times New Roman]*I do not inspect or have any influence over translations of my mods (including those linked directly on my pages), nor do I have any power over patches or add-ons made to my content. So, before using any unofficial add-ons for my mods, make sure they conform to the latest version of my official release, and never use these if they don't. The same applies to Xbox ports;*[/font]

*"Also known as Helhests, these mummified undead horses were the mounts of the ancient Norse, now resurrected by the same kind of power that keeps their former masters awake.*[/font][font=Times New Roman]*The summonable mount version is extremely useful for anyone used to roaming among the dead, and will scare any living soul who sees you approaching riding this nightmare beast."*[/font]

(\*Who is Beastmaster Mihail? He is my avatar/persona within the universe composed of all my mods. He is the ingame author who writes the texts that are usually presented as descriptions for my mods. A former monster hunter, now a dedicated scholar, he is planned to be released as an NPC in late 2022/early 2023, doing the same job in-game as my descriptions do on Nexus.)[/font]

**Technical details:** the mount is as fast as Arvak, albeit with slightly less stamina, and can be summoned anywhere outside in times of need, like the skeletal horse of Soul Cairn. Slightly weaker than a normal horse, it compensates for this weakness by being superior to them in practicality and speed. Spelltome can be found randomly in Nordic dungeons, usually on tables or shelves.

[font=Times New Roman]So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.
  
[/font][font=Times New Roman](OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)[/font]

[font=Times New Roman]The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.[/font]
