**Betty Netch**

  
  
Overhauls the betty netch to be more like its [original counterpart from Morrowind](https://images.uesp.net/d/d4/MW-creature-Betty_Netch.jpg), while retaining the vanilla artstyle.
  
  
**Features:**
  
  

  
* Utilises multilayer parallax to give the "shell" a translucent jelly-like appearance which is much more noticeable in motion.
An adjusted skeleton to make the tail portion smaller, as the original looked odd with the consistency of the new outer material.
