DESCRIPTION
  
   
This mod adds Cliff Racers to the southern parts of Solstheim.
  
The models were created by Phitt ( http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/8579 for original Skyrim) and updated for SSE by me.
  
   
The Cliff Racers are passive critters just like hawks and can be shot down.
  
A collectible food item (Cliffracer Tails) and a recipe for stew are included.
