[/font][font=Times New Roman]*"Pony Guars are particularly popular among Dunmer children as pets. Small, barely larger than a large cat, and often used as companion animals, they are more active than most other subspecies and are also more mischievous and playful . Their meat is said to be unsavory and they are also obviously of no use as pack animals. Some Dunmer use them to hunt small pests.
  
  
 The two common variants are known as Striated Pony Guars, but there are other few documented subspecies, one of them with similar coloration to the brave Banded Guar Charger used by the Redoran guard, those Pony Guars are generally used as mascots by House Redoran and commonly known simply as Redoran Pony Guars. Furthermore, the Temple of Reclamations often adopts as pest control a version similar to the Pale Velothi Guar, but of reduced size, the Temple's Pony Guars. There are also reports of some valuable Pony Guars with albinism among some Dunmer, and Black Marsh has its own variant, the green-colored Tessellated Pony Guar."*[/font][/left][left][font=Times New Roman]

So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
