Know Your Enemy 2 is the successor to Skyrim's most popular resistance overhaul. As challenging and finely balanced as ever, it has been rebuilt from the ground up for the ultimate experience. This is the creature module. There is also an [armor module](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/94067) and a [patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/94078) to integrate the two.
  
  
**Sixteen damage types**: The classic types of blade, axe, blunt, fire, frost, shock, poison and disease remain. Bows are now split into regular bows and crossbows. New damage types include fists, shield bashes, sneak attacks, sun, drain, and illusion.
  
  
**Configurable difficulty**: The MCM lets you choose from 4 levels of effect intensity at any time, magical and physical effects can be configured separately.
  
  
**A simplified experience**: There are no traits and no hidden books, instead enemies fall into one of a small number of categories. Resistances come in only two tiers, "resistances" and "strong resistances".
  
  
**A better inspect power**: The player can inspect creatures at close range to learn their resistances. In the MCM you can activate numerical effect descriptions (e.g. "50% resistant" instead of "highly resistant") or make only dead bodies inspectable.
  
  
**Finely balanced**: All damage types are equally viable, with imbalances in the vanilla game accounted for. Most damage types pair well together for wide coverage.

Most damage types are fully effective against ~50% of enemies, resisted by ~20% and highly resisted by the remaining ~30%, but each type has different enemies they do well or badly against. A successful strategy is to combine two (or even three) different damage types. Picking complementary damage types can provide fully effective damage against ~75% of enemies, and near perfect coverage for mostly effective attacks.
  
  
**Blade**
  
Strengths: Animals and beasts.
  
Weaknesses: Machines and skeletons.
  
Good pairings: Axes, blunt, fire, frost, drain, illusion.
  
Poor pairings: Bows, crossbows, poison, disease.
  
Notes: Blades are great for the the wilderness, but less so against exotic enemies.
  
  
**Axes**Strengths: Animals and the undead.
  
Weaknesses: Only a few unique enemies and ghosts.
  
Good pairings: Anything.
  
Poor pairings: None.
  
Notes: Axes are a low-risk/low-reward strategy; very few creatures are *highly* resistant to them, but many are *somewhat* resistant to them.
  
  
**Blunt**
  
Strengths: Animals, insects, skeletons and dwarven machines.
  
Weaknesses: Beasts.
  
Good pairings: Blades, axes, bows, crossbows, sneak, fire, frost, shock, poison, disease.
  
Poor pairings: Fists, shield bashes, and sun.
  
Notes: Blunt weapons have an unusual profile, being highly resisted by beasts, nonetheless, this means they pair well with many other damage types.
  
  
**Bows** 
  
Strengths: Animals and beasts.
  
Weaknesses: Machines, skeletons and the undead.
  
Good pairings: Axes, blunt, fire, frost.
  
Poor pairings: Blades, crossbows, sneak attacks, shock, poison, disease.
  
Notes: Bows have a similar profile to blades. Any bow without the word "crossbow" in its name is considered a bow.
  
  
**Crossbows**Strengths: The undead and insects.
  
Weaknesses: Skeletons and machines.
  
Good pairings: Axes, blunt, fire and frost
  
Poor pairings: Blades, bows, sneak, shock, poison and disease.
  
Notes: Crossbows are like punchier, more versatile bows, but they are less effective against animals and beasts. Any bow with the word "crossbow" in its name is considered a crossbow.
  
  
**Fists**Strengths: Animals, insects and skeletons.
  
Weaknesses: Beasts and machines.
  
Good pairings: Axes, sneak and fire.
  
Poor pairings: Blunt, shield bashes and sun.
  
Notes: Fists have the same profile as shield bashes.
  
  
**Shield bashes**
  
Strengths: Animals, insects and skeletons.
  
Weaknesses: Beasts and machines.
  
Good pairings: Axes, sneak and fire.
  
Poor pairings: Blunt, shield bashes and sun.
  
Notes: None.
  
  
**Sneak** **attacks**
  
Strengths: Intelligent creatures.
  
Weaknesses: Unintelligent creatures.
  
Good pairings: Axes, blunt, fists, bashes, fire, frost, drain, illusion.
  
Poor pairings: Bows, poison and disease.
  
Notes: Resistances affect the sneak multiplier. Sneak attacks pair relatively poorly with bows, blades and poison, reducing the OP-ness of the stealth-archer build.
  
  
**Fire**Strengths: Animals and the undead.
  
Weaknesses: Some unique enemies.
  
Good pairings: Everything.
  
Poor pairings: None.
  
Notes: Very few enemies have strong fire resistances, though regular resistances are common. To reduce fire being OP, the cost of fire spells is mildly increased, though this can be turned off in the MCM. The MCM has the option to boost fire spells in sunny weather.
  
  
**Frost**Strengths: Dwarven machines, some animals and beasts.
  
Weaknesses: Some beasts.
  
Good pairings: Everything except sun.
  
Poor pairings: None.
  
Notes: Frost is valuable because of its strength against Dwarven machines and it pairs well with most other damage types. Because it is otherwise less useful than fire, the cost of frost spells is mildly reduced, though this can be turned off in the MCM. The MCM has the option to boost frost spells when its snowing.
  
  
**Shock**
  
Strengths: Animals, beasts, insects.
  
Weaknesses: The undead, skeletons and Dwarven machines.
  
Good pairings: Axes, blunt, fire and frost.
  
Poor pairings: Blades, bows, poison and disease.
  
Notes: Shock spells are resisted less often than other damage types, but shock resistances tend to be strong. The MCM has the option to boost shock spells in the rain.
  
  
**Sun**
  
Strengths: The undead, skeletons and some unique enemies.
  
Weaknesses: Everything else.
  
Good pairings: Axes, crossbows, fire and shock.
  
Poor pairings: Blunt, fists and bashes.
  
Notes: Sun is the same as in vanilla, so it typically only affects undead. Because of this it is a poor choice as your primary damage type. The inspect spell does not mention sun damage unless enemies are susceptible to it.
  
  
**Drain**
  
Strengths: Unintelligent creatures.
  
Weaknesses: Intelligent creatures.
  
Good pairings: Axes, fire, frost, sneak.
  
Poor pairings: Sun, illusion.
  
Notes: Drain has the same profile as illusion.
  
  
**Illusion**
  
Strengths: Unintelligent creatures.
  
Weaknesses: Intelligent creatures.
  
Good pairings: Axes, fire, frost, sneak.
  
Poor pairings: Sun, drain.
  
Notes: Illusion has the same profile as drain. Resistances affect the level cap of spells.
  
  
**Poison** 
  
Strengths: Animals and beasts.
  
Weaknesses: The undead, Dwarven machines, skeletons, many unique creatures.
  
Good pairings: Axes, blunt, fire, frost.
  
Poor pairings: Blade, bows, sneak, shock, disease.
  
Notes: Poison is more often strongly resisted than many other damage types.
  
  
**Disease**
  
Strengths: Animals, beasts and insects.
  
Weaknesses: The undead, Dwarven machines, skeletons, many unique creatures.
  
Good pairings: Axes, blunt, fire, frost.
  
Poor pairings: Blade, bows, sneak, shock, poison.
  
Notes: Disease is more often strongly resisted than many other damage types.

**Physical/Magical Effect Intensity**
  
These two sliders set the effect intensity of physical and magical resistances, from 1 (very mild) through 4 (very strong). The default is 3. Weaknesses are always 25% regardless of the setting. The precise values are as follows:
  
  
Level 1: Strong resistance =   25% or   x0.8, Regular resistance = 10% or   x0.9
  
Level 2: Strong resistance =   50% or x0.67, Regular resistance = 25% or   x0.8
  
Level 3: Strong resistance =   75% or   x0.5, Regular resistance = 33% or x0.67
  
Level 4: Strong resistance = 100% or x0.25, Regular resistance = 50% or   x0.5
  
  
Percentage resistances are additive and affect fire, frost, shock, poison and disease, while multiplicative resistances affect all physical damage, drain, and illusion. Note that percentage resistances reach total immunity at level 4, but multiplicative resistances cannot.
  
  
**Can Inspect Living Targets** - If selected you can inspect living targets, otherwise targets must be dead to be inspected. It is enabled by default.
  
**Quantitative Target Descriptions** - ﻿If enabled the inspect spell provides numerical resistances and weaknesses, otherwise effects are described categorically. It is disabled by default for a more polished look.
  
**Rebalance Spell Costs** - If selected the cost of fire spells is slightly increased, while the cost of frost spells is slightly decreased, to improve balance between elements. It is enabled by default.
  
**Boost Silver Damage Against Undead** - If selected silver weapons deal 25% more damage to ghosts, the undead and werewolves. This helps them scale into the late game (in vanilla they deal a flat 20 extra damage, which is great early on, but useless later).
  
**Weather Effects** - If selected fire spells are boosted 25% in sunny weather, frost spells are boosted 25% when snowing and shock spells are boosted 25% in the rain. This applies to NPCs as well as the player!

*Requirements*[SKSE](http://skse.silverlock.org/)﻿ and [SkyUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12604)﻿ - for the MCM and inspect spell
  
[SPID](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869)﻿ and [KID](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55728) - to distribute resistances
  
[Address Library﻿](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444)﻿ - for SPID and KID.
  
If you're not on the most recent Skyrim version you'll need [Backported ESL Support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441).
  
  
*Installation*Download and install through your mod manager of choice. It is safe to install on an existing save. The plugin is ESL-flagged.
  
  
*Updating*Check the update notes. Updates that change script properties will require a new game.
  
  
*Uninstallation*Safe to uninstall at any time.
  
  
*Performance impact*None.
  
  
*Compatibility*KYE2 uses SPID to distribute resistances which greatly increases compatibility. However, the following issues may still arise:
  

  
* KYE2 edits the racial abilities of vanilla creatures (not playable races) to remove resistances and weaknesses. If other mods edit these records a conflict will arise.
Where mods add their own resistances and weaknesses they will stack with KYE2, potentially creating seriously tough enemies.
  
* Where mods add new elemental spells, they might not interact with KYE2's resistances ﻿(though many do).
CACO's undead poisons rely on undead having 0 poison resistance. With KYE2 installed, CACO's undead poisons won't work against the undead. There's a patch in the optional downloads to fix this.
  

  
*Extensibility*
  
KYE2 distributes resistances according to enemy race. Mods that create new enemy races will need an expansion patch. Mods that add new enemies to existing races will not need a patch. A [Dragonborn's Bestiary Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/124145?tab=description) is available.
