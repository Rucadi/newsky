> Animated by the Forgotten Vale's finest artificers, these constructs were designed to guard sacred sites and repel intruders with unrelenting might. They remain active centuries later, a testament to the resilience Snow Elves and their lost era.

  
Fractured Envoys & Ushers can be found roaming the Forgotten Vale, Betrayed Envoys & Ushers can be found guarding Falmer camps in the Forgotten Vale, Chantry Envoys & Ushers can be found guarding the Inner Sanctum where Auriel's Bow is. All the creatures are at least level 20.
  
  
All enemies will drop unique items needed to craft the armor and weapons, under Elven at a forge.
  
  
There is a table beside Vyrthur's Throne in the Inner Sanctum with all possible drops from the Envoys and Ushers. (Along with some spell tomes to summon each enemy)
  
  
Plugin is Flagged ESL.
  
  
There is 1 main file for this mod.[/font]
