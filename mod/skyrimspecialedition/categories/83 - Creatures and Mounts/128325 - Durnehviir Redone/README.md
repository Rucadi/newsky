# Durnehviir Redone
- Author: Lucaoys
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

[left]**2.1: Removed the green mucus layer in the model that looked bad in some graphical set ups.
  
Aded more conditions for drain life shout use.
  
Slightly edited the combat styles of both enemy and ally Durnehviir. 
  
  
UPDATE 2.0: MAJOR.
  
  
Bugfix: Cleaned lots of unused records.
  
  
GRAPHICS:**

  
* **[b]All breath effects have improved VFX.**[/b]
**Added quite a bit of scripting to the mod**
  

  
**SHOUTS:**

  

  
* **Improved shout variety: now Durnehviir will choose between three different shouts: A green breath (the one that used before, nullifies health and magicka regens, leaves fire walls in the ground), a lifedrain breath (drains life, drains stamina, nullifies stamina regen, frightens NPCs) and a unique; long range green firestorm that will damage over a conical surface and leave firewalls in the ground as it advances.**
**The different shouts have some specific conditions to ensure some variety (and not only just spam of the green breath).**
  
* **The secondary breath (lifedrain) will be used a lot more often, though less than the green fire breath.**

  
**LEVELING:**

  
* **Durnehviir has less base health, but gains more as he levels up.**
**Durnehviir shouts will properly level up with the player now (from 30 dps to over 150 dps).**
  
* **Durnehviir will be less powerful at low levels, but gain power quickly as the player levels up.**

**MELEE COMBAT AND PHYSICAL DAMAGE:**

  
* **[b]Durnehviir bite will deal aditional green fire damage (a visual effect of a small explosion and a green fire shader on affected characters will be** [/b]
**[b]visible)**[/b]
  
* **[b]Durnehvir tail and wing attacks will knock down in a larger area and do more AOE damage.**[/b]
**[b]Durnehviir will deal a small amount of damage and knock down actors when landing and taking flight.**[/b]
  

*Overall ;I Tried to stablish as many differences as posible with Durnehviir God of Death to make the mod less redundant.***THE MOD:**[/left]
  
Do you also think Durnehviir is a really cool character with a lot of potential that didn't quite meet the expectations? No more.
  
  
This mod will do the following:
  
  
1)Give Durnehviir it's own custom proportions; he will be larger, with proportionally larger torso, wings, and a much longer tail. He will look monstruous next to other dragons if you don't use [Majestic Dragons.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120239) The skeleton used for him is the equivalent of Majestic Dragons- Mole, neck saddle.
  
2) Give Durnehviir a new custom model (equal to the one he was given in [Dragon Models Modernized and Redesigned](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/122491)). He will also have custom upscaled and HD textures.

3)Give him a lot more base HP, to make the fight vs him longer, tougher, and more interesting (3000 health offset). The health will increase a lot as the dragon levels up.
  
4) Removed the "drain vitality" and "frost breath" shouts vanilla Durnehviir had. 
  
5) He will now have three different custom breaths: A necrotic looking green coldfire that will explode in area (like [better dragon breath effects](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/121210)) and generate green walls of fire. This breath also other unique propierties; It will impede your health and magicka regeneration for 30 seconds if you get hit. All breaths gain power as your character levels up, in both enemy and ally Durnehviir.

6) The second breath is a red, life draining one that he will use less often and medium distance: (drains life, drains stamina, nullifies stamina regen, frightens NPCs)**![](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/128325/128325-1753728512-1249988456.png)
  
7)** The third is a unique; long range green firestorm that will damage over a conical surface and leave firewalls in the ground as it advances.
  
  
All in all, his breaths will be different to any used by any other dragon in the game and those added to any other mod, making him truly unique. 
  
  
8)He will knock down npcs with melee attacks and stagger, and deal aoe with physical attacks, like it happens with [Better and Realistic Dragon melee.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/121460)
  
9)His bite attack deals extra green fire damage, with the corresponding cool graphical effects.
  
  
10) When you fight him, he will knock down and deal small damage to nearby enemies when landing and taking off. Ally Durnehviir won't have this behaviour to prevent problems and incompatibilities with other allies or mods.
  
  
11)Durnehvir stats as an ally have also been buffed (increased breath damage as your MC levels up, more health, extra shouts), and he no longer will summon the undead allies, but use his new breaths instead.
  
  
12)He is undead, so  he will be resistant to frost damage and inmune to poison and disease damage like the undead dragons in my other mod, Epic Dragon Combat.
  
**13) BONUS:** Now he has a vulnerability to fire, in case you want to play strategic!
  
14)Last but not least, ¡He will get big glowing purple eyes!
  
  
**INSTALLATION**
  

  
* The mod is standalone, it doesn't require anything other than the base game, BUT it is compatible with all my other mods, that do similar overhauls to the rest of the dragons.
To install, simple download the zip and extract it with your mod manager, or extract it's content in your game's data folder. I recommend using a mod manager like Mod Organizer 2.
  

  

**COMPATIBILITY:**

  
  

  
* It is compatible with other durnehviir visual overhauls if you pick the Gameplay only option.
It isn't compatible with mods that alter durnehviir directly. If you want this mod to work, you always have to load it after anything that affects durnehviir. However, you can choose the graphics only version if you want the looks but the mod being compatible with other dragon overhauls.
  
* Like I said, it is compatible with all my other mods from the beggining.

**[left]EXTRAS:
  
  

  
* I included an alternative, optional file that only replaces the graphics for Durnehviir, but not the gameplay changes, in case you prefer that one.
Likewise, there's also an alternative file for those who want the gameplay changes, but want him to look like the vanilla version.
