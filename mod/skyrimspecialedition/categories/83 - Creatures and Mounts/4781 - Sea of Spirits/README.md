[font=Papyrus]*A real whale of a tale!*[/font]

**Description:**
  
This mod turns the Sea of Ghosts (and the rest of the seas in Skyrim and Solstheim) into a lively Sea of Spirits by adding many new sea creatures, like whales, narwhals, several kinds of sharks, dreugh, and many others to the seas. Essentially this mod is just a "sea creatures-only" version of our [Beasts of Tamriel](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/76203/?) mod (although it doesn't have all of the sea creatures in BoT).
  
  
Spoiler: Please do not post about these in the comments! At least not without adding the spoiler tag, seen below.
  
Spoiler Snow whales can be found flying in the mountains above high wrothgar. They are very rare so you won't see them often. If they are not your thing, please do not complain about it in the comments. They could easily be removed using the CK and delete their entry. 
  
  
**Requirements:**
  
Requires the Dragonborn DLC.
  
  
**Recommended Mods:**
  
[Skyrim Behavior Organizer by Zartar](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/38376/?) (adds underwater combat)
  
[Snow Whale Bones by RustyShackleford](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30859) 
  
[Script free ship sailing by ElstarTomas](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/67727/?) 
  
  
**Known Issues:**
  
Don't use this mod if you're already using our [Beasts of Tamriel](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/76203/?) mod. It shouldn't cause too much incompatibility, but you'll get
  
duplicates of almost everything. Also the mod may have issues if you use
  
 it with mods that add ships to the seas, like Navies of Skyrim, which
  
add lots of ships to areas with sea creatures in them, effectively
  
causing collision issues which result in large sea creatures like the
  
whales being lifted over the ships. Since there are many mods that add
  
ships, the easiest fix for this would be to go into the CK with both SoS
  
 and the ship mod you're using loaded and manually move the whales away
  
from the ships the mod adds.
