Using Spell Perk Item Distributor (**SPID**) to make all horses (vanilla, and modded) better.
  
  
  
**Effects ?**
  
+300 Stamina
  
+30% Speed
  
  
  
**Why ?**
  
You buy a horse, expecting to move faster, easier, but that's not truly the case.
  
Even worse when you increased the price with mods, and lore wise, those are expensive - so let's made them worthwhile.
  
  
Horse can keep up for longer before running out of stamina, running away is easier.
  
They move faster than humans, let's make us feel this.
  
  
  
**Compatibility ?**No conflicts possible.
  
No vanilla files are edited, and using **SPID** make this works on **ALL horses**, modded or vanilla.
  
Use a **ESPFE** (ESP file flagged as **ESL**), so it won't take up a slot in your load order.
  
  
Compatible with M'rissi's Tails Of Troubles mount, Lirry.
