*![](https://i.imgur.com/PwJxVUw.png)**"Shrouded in mystery and horror, Wendigos are Reachmen who have surrendered fully to the cannibalistic creed of Namira. Through forbidden rites, they are twisted into abominations — their bodies corrupted, their souls torn apart — becoming creatures suspended between life and undeath, between decaying flesh and spectral nightmare. They wander ceaselessly, driven by an insatiable hunger for human flesh.
  
  
Only Hagravens seem capable of commanding them, serving as foul intermediaries between this world and the unspeakable one these beasts partially inhabit. Their garb resembles traditional Reachfolk/ Forsworn symbolism, primitive ragged leathers, and tribal markings. Their skulls evoke the aspect of Hircine, but with predatory fangs, made to rend flesh and crush bone with terrifying ease.
  
  
Little is known about Wendigos, not due to lack of interest, but because those who encounter them rarely survive. The few that do speak of a descent into living nightmare: sudden chills, heart racing uncontrollably, vision dimming and the world losing all color. At the first unearthly howl, blackness falls like a curtain, and the nightmare truly begins.
  
  
Wendigos appear to exist between planes, the material world and a type of nightmare world, not tied to Vaermina's nightmare-realm, but to a more visceral, obscene domain, one steeped in Namira’s foul influence. They manifest seemingly out of nothing and vanish just as quickly with the coming of sunlight. Killing them leaves no corpse, no remains. They arrive and depart like phantoms — leaving behind only broken victims and the echo of screams.
  
  
They are not meant for the faint of heart. The mere presence of one induces a lucid terror few can resist. And yet, there are whispers among the wise: fire may be the only weapon that truly harms the beast. Flames to purify that which was never meant to exist."*

(\*Who is Beastmaster Mihail? He is my avatar/persona within the universe composed of all my mods. He is the ingame author who writes the texts that are usually presented as descriptions for my mods. A former monster hunter, now a dedicated scholar, he is planned to be released as an NPC in late 2022/early 2023, doing the same job in-game as my descriptions do on Nexus.)
  
  
  
TECHNICAL INFO: ﻿Wendigos appear rarely, and only in pine forests. They can only be found at night, and only after the player reaches level 35.

So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
