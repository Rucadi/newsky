First and foremost:
  
  
[b]This mod works with any dragon replacer or retexture**. It just changes the proportions, their bones, posture, and size.
  
  

  
* This includes: Game of Thrones Dragons, Dragons SE (by 4th unknown, and also the diverse version), and Dragon Models Modernized. GOT, Dragons SE, and Dragons Modernized provide their own skeleton.nif within the model pack; just overwrite it with this and everything will work.
It also works with rextextures that don't remodel the dragons (like Bellyaches' etc).
  

  
EXTREMELY RECOMMENDED MOD TO USE WITH THIS: [No Dragons to Character Killmoves](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/159919)﻿
  
The Mod [/b]
  
Until now, every attempt to upsize the dragons has failed, with the exception of mods that slightly augments the wingspan, like immersive dragons. A simple skeleton or mesh multiplier makes them unable to aim, missing the breath attacks, makes them clunkier, ruins their pathfinding, and bugs thir animations, which hit the air rather than the enemies. No more!
  
  
This mod is an skeleton edit section by section and bone by bone, with some repositioning. Now dragons are larger overall.; and have much proportionally larger wingspan (able to lift them in the air) and longer tail (making them look more elegant, and proportionate with the other edits). The rest of the body is also moderately larger.They are perfectly able to aim and every animation works perfectly, including killing moves.
  
  
![](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/120239/120239-1757809378-1795103103.jpg)
  
***"In vanilla Skyrim, dragons often looked underwhelming—too small, oddly proportioned, and lacking the majesty one would expect from legendary creatures. With Majestic Dragons, they are reimagined as towering, sky-filling titans. Paired with [Fire and Blood’s dynamic weathers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/156018), every encounter feels like a cinematic event rather than just another fight."***

  
* **With 3.1 comes a new version: Beauty.** This one doesn't do a "global" upsize of the dragon, it only enlarges and repositions specific sections strategically. If you want to reduce any posible visual, clipping, or animation glitch to 0 and are a fanatic of immersion, but still wanna boost the dragon appereance significantly, this is the version for you.
**With 3.0, we also get Colossal**: the "new Mole" and it is better at that: substantially larger, taller, with a bigger head, and more robust appereance. And all that with less glitches. This is the version for you if you are a fan of large dragons, and want your dragons as huge as posible.
  

  
We also got a misc file for fun: Majestic mini dragons! See for yourself what would happen if dragon younglings were a thing in the elder scrolls lore.
  
  
**Author recommendations:** 
  

  
* If you want to try the mod, but are unsure of which version to use: Start with Glorious, which is the original edit (all the others are derivative), and swicth if you think you would like other version better.
If you want to try the mod but are cautious about it (for example you are afraid it might break stuff, though no version should break anything important); start with Beauty. You can switch to larger versions afterwards if it is too "subtle" for your taste (it's not though, you will notice the difference immediately)

[left]**COMPATIBILITY:** 
  
  
COMPATIBLE WITH EVERYTHING that isn't a dragon mesh skeleton file. It is compatible with GOT dragons, Dragons SE, and Dragon Models Modernized and Redesigned. You must load the mod after all of them, overwriting the skeleton file. Just don't let any other dragon skeleton mesh overwrite this one. (if using got dragons, don't download the skeleton mesh or let this one overwrite it).
  
  
The mod will alter EVERY dragon in your game, altering every mesh replacer you use. It is compatible out of the box with deadly dragons, diverse dragons, ultimate dragons... It is also compatible with dragon combat overhaul.
  
  
Obviously incompatible with immersive dragons, immersive dragons resized, and butterfly dragons, which alter the same file.[/left]
  
**Example: DEADLY DRAGONS (Sun Dragon)+DRAGON COMBAT OVERHAUL+ GOT HOTD DRAGONS+ DRAGON ATTACKS+ MAJESTIC DRAGONS GLORIOUS:**

**ADDED SUPPORT FOR [TRUE DRAGONS MOD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106755).** For that, you only need to download the optional file called Majestic True Dragons. Load it after the true dragons mod. It is a custom skeleton I made for it . The proportions of the wings in the main file are those of the tame version (WIP 1.3). There is a second file, giving it the majestic Dragons Mole proportions. The saddle is in the neck, as that mod works best with vanilla dragons. Let me know how it works! :
