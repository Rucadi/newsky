# EMPEROR - Giant Crab Overhaul
- Author: opusGlass
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

The Fishing creation adds an awesome giant crab boss battle.
  
It's the first time the Emperor Crab from lore has been seen in any TES game.
  
  
Unfortunately, there are a couple issues:
  
- The beautiful artwork is mostly hidden behind ghost FX.
  
- Much of the battle is not animated, making the crab (and the experience) a bit...lifeless...for lack of better word.
  
- One of the attacks is unused to avoid clipping.
  
- Some sound FX are unused or too quiet to hear.
  
  
This mod fixes and enhances the encounter:
  
- The ghost FX will now pulsate, allowing you to see the crab's intricate artwork while remaining ghostly.
  
- Several key moments of the battle are now animated, improving the visual storytelling and immersion while staying true to the Creation Club's intention.
  
- The disabled attack animation was fixed and enabled, enhancing the unpredictability and variety in the battle.
  
- Sound FX are better utilized, adding interactivity and depth to the battle.
  
  
For a less ghostly version (always opaque instead of pulsating), see [wSkeever's addon for this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65947).

**Detailed Features**
  
are inside this spoiler tag: Spoiler
  
As this is an enhancement of content from Fishing, each feature is intended to solve a certain problem I noticed.
  
  
Problem: While the ghost FX look cool, they prevent us from seeing the full quality of the unique Emperor Crab model.
  
Solution: A pulsing effect alternates between a fully opaque model and a ghastly transparent glow as seen in vanilla. The transparency and glow pulse separately, creating a broad spectrum of eerie visuals.
  
  
Problem: At the start of battle, the crab instantly appears while you're inside the fisherman's hut. The player controls get locked for a couple seconds to stop you from going out and seeing the crab appear, though you can still see it out the open door/window.
  
Solution: An animation was added for the crab to crawl out of the ocean. The player's controls do not get locked. Seeing the crab emerge helps to create tension in addition to not breaking immersion by removing your control.
  
  
Problem: A wagon of ammo is "destroyed" by the crab, and this is an important moment, but it happens offscreen at the same time as the crab appears. As a result, it isn't very noticeable.
  
Solution: The crab now visibly smashes the wagon early in your battle. 
  
  
Problem: At the end of battle, the crab instantly disappears with no FX or other tricks to hide it.
  
Solution: An animation was added for the crab to flail in pain and retreat to the ocean. In addition to being less jarring, this creates a sense of pride and accomplishment.
  
  
Problem: If you defeat the crab while its in the middle of an attack animation, it freezes in that pose for ~5 seconds before it disappears.
  
Solution: The defeat sequence will now wait until the crab has finished attacking.
  
  
Problem: The crab only uses 5 of its 6 attack animations, because the 6th would clip into the fisherman's hut.
  
Solution: The 6th attack animation was modified to prevent clipping, and added back into the game.
  
  
Problem: Between attacks, only the crab's mouthparts are animated.
  
Solution: In addition to the pulsing ghost FX, I've enhanced the animated loop with bodily oscillation and claw-clicking.
  
  
Problem: The crab plays "Injured" audio when it is hit, but it's too quiet to hear. 
  
Solution: Increased the volume of the Injured audio.
  
  
Problem: The crab has audio for being defeated, but it was unused.
  
Solution: The defeat audio was added into the battle and had its volume increased.
  
  
  
  
**FAQ**
  
What's an Emperor Crab? In TES lore, Emperor Crabs are an extinct species of enormous crabs. In ancient Morrowind, the Redoran used the shells of dead Emperor Crabs for buildings. Today, that tradition lives on in architecture that mimics the shape of an Emperor Crab, as seen in Raven Rock.
  
  
Is this for sure an Emperor Crab? Yes, the in-game quest objectives actually label it as an Emperor Crab (in addition to the monstrous size and clear resemblance to Redoran architecture). 
  
  
Just how big is it? A single claw is much larger than a dragon.
  
  
How do you encounter this battle? SpoilerIt occurs at the end of Viriya's questline. You can find Viriya at Riften docks. You will need to do other Fishing quests to continue unlocking Viriya's quests.
  
Is there a version with the ghost FX removed completely? [Yes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65947)
  
  
Can this be ported to LE? No, it is an add-on for Fishing, which is only on SE.
