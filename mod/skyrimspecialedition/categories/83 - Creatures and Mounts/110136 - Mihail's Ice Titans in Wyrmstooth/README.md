Adds Ice Titans to Wyrmstooth for more creature variety, they're mostly on the coast and in larger numbers overall compared to Skyrim's mainland, you'll find them usually near ship wrecks as fitting to their lore and they're pretty much wearing ship wrecks themselves and using anchors as weapons. I haven't actually played Wyrmstooth, just ran around it and thought it was gorgeous so tell me if they're interfering with quests and where and I'll move/remove them.

I uploaded six versions depending on interests If you want a version with just the Ice Titan removed from the cramped mountain pass in Skyrim then ask and I'll probably make it. Tell me if there are issues I created them all at the same time and probably missed something.
  
  
  
Please give suggestions on where to place other Mihail NPCs in Wyrmstooth and I will probably do so if I use the creatures myself.
