[font=Comic Sans MS]Shroom Beetles are Mushroom covered beetles that originated on the island of Vvardenfell and ﻿﻿Murkmire. Most of them were killed off during the Red Year disaster. What left of them remained ventured out beyond into the mainland of Morrowind eventually traveling westward into the Rift, northwards into Solstheim by boarding on ships and clinging onto Netches for dear life.
  
  
Another species of Shroom Beetle can be found in Blackreach, no one knows for sure how they ended up there. Perhaps underground systems are much bigger than believed or at least they were much bigger in the past, stretching out from Blackreach and into multiple locations around Tamriel such as Vvardenfell. These Shroom Beetles could then take refuge, eventually reaching Blackreach and developing bioluminescence in the process as the years have gone by.[/font]
