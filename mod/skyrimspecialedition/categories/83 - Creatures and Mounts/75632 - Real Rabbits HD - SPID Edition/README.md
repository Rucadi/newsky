[Real Rabbits HD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29223) by [fadingsignal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/2546964) includes a unique, high poly mesh with fur shell, outstanding textures, and a script to randomly apply one of six different color patterns to each rabbit. With [Spell Perk Item Distributor (SPID)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869), the script can be run at game start for every rabbit without conflicting any mod. Using SPID, there are no patches needed for [SkyTEST](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1104)﻿, [Seasonal Wildlife](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63700), [Savage Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37768), or any other mod affecting bunny populations and behaviors.

**Real Rabbits HD﻿**

  
Real Rabbits HD adds new high-resolution textures and higher-poly mesh with fuzzy fur shells, while keeping close to the vanilla colors and art style.  It also adds 5 extra colors, with an extremely light-weight "skin randomizer" so all the rabbits in your game will look different.

**﻿SPID Edition**

  
The ESP drops out edits to the hare race and replaces them with a SPID distribution text file to accomplish the same thing - give a spell script to every rabbit in the freaking world.
  
  

**Installation**

  
Spell Perk Item Distributor is required. SPID distributes at game start. If you do not have SPID or you install this on an existing game, the script will never run and every rabbit will look furry and impressive but exactly the same. 
  
  
[Static Mesh Improvement Mod Improvement Mod (SMIMIM)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55543) includes matching meshes for hanging rabbits.
