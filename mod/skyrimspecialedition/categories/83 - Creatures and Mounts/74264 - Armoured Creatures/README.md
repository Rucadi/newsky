Ever wonder why Dragons, from which you can make one of the strongest armor available, don't have any defense? This mod fixes that, alongside other creatures, including Dwarven Automatons, Atronachs, Draugr, Skeletons, Falmer, Chaurus, Mudcrabs and Death Hounds. The armor value depends on the creature's level. I didn't add armor to Gargoyles as they already have armor
  
  
To make sure if a creature has armor or not, select them with console commands and type "getav damageresist" if it is 0 then they have no armor
  
  
If there is any creature I forgot to add armor to, please don't hesitate to notify me.
  
  
This mod utilizes SPID, so it should be compatible with anything, including any mods that add new Dragons, Automatons, etc
