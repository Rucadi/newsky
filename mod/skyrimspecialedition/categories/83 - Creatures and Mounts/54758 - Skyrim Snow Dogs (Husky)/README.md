**Skyrim Snow Dogs - A Husky Conversion**

The Scottish Wolfhound/Irish Deerhound model for the vanilla Skyrim dogs isn't terribly unrealistic. But if the Nords are based off of Scandinavian cultures like the Norse, then *technically* a dog like a husky would be more true-to-tradition.
  
 
  
       The **Vikings** harbored a number of dogs as pets, which they brought along to their settlements in the British Isles; but these dogs were mostly of the **spitz-type**, which the Scottish and Irish hounds **are not**.
  
  
      **Spitz**dog breeds, including and similar to the husky, tend to have pointed ears, thick/long winter fur, and long tails that curl up over the back or hang down. They tend to look more similar to foxes and wolves than other dog breeds.
  
  
Some more traditional/accurate examples of spitz-type dog breeds raised by Scandinavian cultures would be Buhunds, Vallhunds, Lundehunds, Icelandic Sheepdogs, and Elkhounds.
  
  
Two versions of Skyrim Snow Dogs:
  
  
1.  **ALL DOGS** use the new husky model. That means the vanilla hounds AND the vanilla huskies are replaced by the new husky.
  
  
2. **ONLY HUSKIES** from the Dawnguard DLC are replaced. That means the vanilla hounds are not touched.
  
  
  
Other than offering that bit of dog trivia there's not much else to say.
  
I found this dog model closer than the vanilla dogs to an immersive aesthetic.

Compatibility:
  
  

  
* [font=Georgia]Compatible with any mod that doesn't do the same thing. This mod contains a single plugin, along with some textures and meshes. There aren't any new scripts, sounds, or data edits other than changing the vanilla and husky dogs to use the new model.[/font]

  

  
* Any mods that change certain vanilla dogs (like Meeko) to use a unique model are compatible. They will remain unique rather than look like this new husky. If you want them to look like the new husky from this mod, then uninstall the mod that makes them unique.

  

  
* [font=Georgia]Any dogs added by other mods that use the vanilla model will also be changed. As mentioned above, it is only if they already include their own unique meshes/textures or file-paths that they will **not** be altered by this mod.[/font]

  
  
Installation:
  
  
[/font]

  
* [font=Georgia]Download and install like any other mod with your manager of choice.[/font]

* [font=Georgia]ESPFE (ESL-flagged) plugins are the standard so it won't count towards TESV's plugin limit.[/font]
