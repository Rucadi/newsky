**Better Mimics**
  
This mod improves Mihail's Mimics by adding some much needed functionality and compatibility to create a true Mimic experience.
  
I noticed in Mihail's original mod that I hardly ever run across Mimics and after looking into it it turns out he meticulously hand placed his Mimics in some select dungeons so if you never go there you never see them! and because I use Quick Loot I could always instantly tell if a chest was a mimic which is no fun at all. this mod fixes all of that.
  
  
Changes:
  

  
* Using Base Object Swapper, Mimics will now replace vanilla chests!.
Mimics now appear as real containers, that means if you have Quick Loot installed you will be able to view the contents of a mimic as if it were a real chest (but watch out if you try to grab anything!).
  
* Mimics, while in their chest form, will use the exact same chest model that you use so there isn't any way to tell them apart.
Includes 5 different Mimic types
  
* Mimic's tongues are SMP physics enabled
Mimics use all the same leveled lists as vanilla chests too.
  
* if a Mimic fools you they get a huge buff and become a lethal threat. however if you check them with a weapon / spell they're caught off guard and get no buff.

  
Compatibility:
  

  
* Snazzy Ruins Chests - Compatible
Chest Variants - Compatible - however Mimics will only replace standard chests
  
  

  
Notes:
  
-Mimics have a 10% chance of replacing vanilla chests by default however this can be modified in \_SWAP.ini
  
-Mimics in their chest form will only react to the player hitting them. if a follower, summon, enemy or anything else hits them they will stay in chest form.
  
-I have it setup to have a chance to replace all treasure chests that use the supported models. this may result in some situations that make no sense (like how did a mimic make it's way into a heavily fortified bandit base?). every type of boss chest is separated inside the \_SWAP.ini file so you can disable what you want
  
  
Requirements:
  
Mihail's Mimic & Ooze mod
  
OR
  
Mihail's Chest Mimic mod
  
Base Object Swapper (this mod does nothing without it)
  
SMIM (or atleast the chest textures)
  
Powerofthree's Papyrus extender
  
  
Install:
  
Use your mod manager of choice and load it after Mihail's Mimic mod, the ESP is ESL flagged so will not consume a load-order slot
