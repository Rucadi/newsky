**﻿Maya the bunny - a CC Thistle replacer**

This is a simple skin/name replacer for Thistle the bunny pet from [Pets of Skyrim CC](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Pets_of_Skyrim). 
  
Needless to say you will need to own that CC (also included in the AE upgrade) in order for this mod to work.﻿
  
  
**This mod changes both Thistle's skin and changes its name to Maya.**
  
  
I always felt like it was a shame Thistle didn't have an unique skin so I made one myself. I actually did this skin many years ago, not too long after "Maya", a silver marten bunny pet I used to share in my household back in the day, sadly passed away. 
  
  
My original intent was to have Maya still around, in a way. So I recreated her and am now sharing it with anyone who would like to have a unique bunny replacement and share many adventures with her :)
  
  
Installation:
  
  
I highly recommend using your Mod Manager of choice or install the files manually in your Skyrim SE installation folder.
  
The file is an ESL so it won't use up a slot.
  
  
Enjoy!
