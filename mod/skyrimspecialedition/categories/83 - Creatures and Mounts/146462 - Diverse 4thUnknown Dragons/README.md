**Welcome to Diverse 4thUnknown Dragons (D4D)**

  

**Allow me to ask and answer a couple questions that will explain the functions and benefits of this mod.**

If you want the condensed version, stick to the brief overview at the top of the page, or skip the answers you are already familiar with.

  

**Q: What's the "problem" with vanilla dragon diversity & how does D4D improve it?**

**A:** SpoilerIn vanilla Skyrim, there are only 8 generic dragon skins/types; the basic dragon, blood, frost, elder, ancient, serpentine, revered, and legendary dragon. In a playthrough of hundreds of hours, **you only ever see those 8 dragons again and again.** Dragon types are also level-gated, so until Lv. 36, you will only see the first 3 types (basic, blood, frost) again and again. All types will not appear randomly until Lv. 78—that's a *long time* to wait for 8 dragons!
  
  
**D4D improves this situation immensely** with 40 additional dragon skins, plus unique skins for all named dragons. Skyrim has 16 named dragons, but only 4 were given unique skins (Alduin, Paarthurnax, Durnehviir, Odahviing). For example, in vanilla Skyrim, [Mirmulnir](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Mirmulnir)—whom we all know for his attack on the Western Watchtower—uses the same skins as the 8 basic dragons. But with D4D installed, Mirmulnir and others like him will now have unique skins to match their names, and before Lv. 36, you will now see a variety of 20 dragon skins (up from 3), and by level 78, you will see 45 (up from 8). Dragon types are now differentiated by color (matching vanilla as closely as possible), with every skin showcased in D4D's images for users to preview.
  
  
D4D is based on and requires **[4thunknown's Dragons SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/132218)﻿**, which has no Serpentine Dragon replacer, **but D4D DOES!** In the Dragonborn DLC's files, the Serpentine Dragon is referred to as a "black" dragon, so in D4D, these dragons come with diverse dark skins. D4D also changes their name to "Sinister Dragon," since their appearance is not strictly serpent-like. **I have also added a "No Serpentine" version of D4D** in the files that does not replace or make any changes to them, if you prefer (for more info, see the relevant spoiler under "Installation").

  
  

**Q: What is the difference between D4D & older mods like Diverse Dragons Collection?**

**Note**: **D4D** goes the extra mile to make 4th's Dragons SE **compatible** with older mods like DDC, in addition to D4D's features.

**A:**SpoilerMods like [Deadly Dragons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23723)﻿, [DDC SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/695)﻿﻿, and most other past mods with a similar goal, achieve their diversity by creating new dragon NPCs that use new skins, then adding them to the vanilla world or leveled lists. To put this another way, **these mods do NOT give vanilla dragons access to *diverse skins* (like D4D does); instead, they create diversity by adding to *dragon types* (new dragons), which leads to a host of compatibility issues,** as many may know from trying to combine them with other dragons mods (e.g., [Dragon War](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51310)﻿, [Dragons Use Thu'um](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/87085)﻿, [Better Dragon Breath](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/121210)﻿﻿, and so on). Each of those other mods requires *its own patch* for these other dragon mods, and many of those patches *also conflict with each other* and can't be properly combined without *another* patch merging their changes, and so it accumulates. The skins these new dragon types use are also based on the vanilla model and will not magically transform to fit a completely new one like 4th's Dragons SE. 
  
  
**D4D's alternative approach eliminates the crux of compatibility issues, and requires NO scripts, NO new NPCs, and NO edited leveled lists.** D4D requires [SkyPatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106659)﻿, but that is NOT how it achieves the bulk of its compatibility. SkyPatcher is primarily used to assign unique skins to the 12 named vanilla dragon NPCs without the need for patching. If I removed SkyPatcher and the named dragon skins, you would still get all of D4D's other features with compatible ease. **All in all, D4D offers more skin diversity than most past similar mods, and will largely work out of the box with any mods that overhaul dragons in other ways**.

  
  

![](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/146462/146462-1744241658-27690515.png)

  

D4D should not require any additional plugins/patches in order to be compatible with mods overhauling dragon combat (stats, breaths, AI, shouts, animations, etc.), loot, leveled lists, or skeleton. In addition to this, I have built in support for mods that add new dragon meshes/textures to the game like **DDCSE**and **Deadly Dragons**, so that D4D's users **can use these mods** with **Dragons SE** without having to wait for those patches (I still hope someone will make them, but D4D can fill the gap until then, in addition to its main functions).

  

**EXAMPLES OF MODS WITH NO CONFLICTS & NO OVERLAP:**

SpoilerThis does not list every compatible mod.
  
Most dragon mods fit into this category, so I couldn't possibly list every one.
  
Consider these examples and assume similar mods are also compatible.

**LIST OF MODS WITH ADDED DRAGONS SE SUPPORT:**
  
Feel free to leave a comment explaining any issues if you have a mod you suspect requires support for Dragons SE.
  
SpoilerThe following mods add new dragon types to the game based on the vanilla assets. Normally, these would not be compatible with any non-vanilla dragon model (like Dragons SE) without custom patches, but I have taken the time to account for these mods using SkyPatcher for out-of-the-box integration. By this, I mean that the new dragons in these mods will have their skin swapped for one in D4D that matches their original look/name. This way, users of D4D can use these mods with Dragons SE without consistency issues, benefitting from whatever features they offer besides dragon diversity. If custom Dragons SE patches for these mods are ever created and shared publicly, I will remove D4D's support and direct users to install those patches instead (see the "More Mods for 4th's Dragons" section at the bottom of the mod page).

[**Deadly Dragons**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23723)SpoilerThis mod adds 14 dragons to the game with vanilla-based skins that have been swapped for consistency with Dragons SE using D4D's assets. You should not install this mod for its dragon diversity, since D4D already covers this feature, and the "support" being offered here does not include new meshes for these dragons, it simply reuses the ones you are already getting from D4D. Only install this mod alongside D4D if you want the unique breaths/shouts of its dragons, or its options for difficulty and assaults. D4D's support should work for all versions of Deadly Dragons. **Note that the "undead" dragons (Bone Dragon & Dracolich) are not replaced by D4D because they are mostly just skeletons.**[﻿**Diverse Dragons Collection**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/695)SpoilerThis mod adds 28 dragons to the game with vanilla-based skins that have been swapped for consistency with Dragons SE using D4D's assets.

SpoilerThis mod adds 13 dragons to the game with vanilla-based skins that have been swapped for consistency with Dragons SE using D4D's assets. You should not install this mod for its dragon diversity, since D4D already covers this feature, and the "support" being offered here does not include new meshes for these dragons, it simply reuses the ones you are already getting from D4D. Only install this mod alongside D4D if you like the unique breaths/stats of its dragons, or the way you can find them idling in the wilderness.[**Enhanced Mighty Dragons V4.1**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5982)﻿
  
SpoilerThis mod adds 5 dragons to the game with vanilla-based skins that have been swapped for consistency with Dragons SE using D4D's assets. You should not install this mod for its dragon diversity, since D4D already covers this feature, and the "support" being offered here does not include new meshes for these dragons, it simply reuses the ones you are already getting from D4D.

SpoilerThis mod adds 3 dragons to the game with vanilla-based skins that have been swapped for consistency with Dragons SE using D4D's assets. You should not install this mod for its dragon diversity, since D4D already covers this feature, and the "support" being offered here does not include new meshes for these dragons, it simply reuses the ones you are already getting from D4D.

SpoilerThis mod adds 22 dragons to the game with its own unique skins and models that have been swapped for consistency with Dragons SE using D4D's assets. You should not install this mod for its dragon diversity, since D4D already covers this feature, and the "support" being offered here does not include new meshes for these dragons, it simply reuses the ones you are already getting from D4D. Only install this mod alongside D4D if you like the unique breaths/shouts/stats of these dragons, or the merged features of the author's other work. **Note that the "undead" dragon is not replaced by D4D because it is mostly a skeleton**[**Elemental Dragons**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/62493) 
  
SpoilerThis SE port was removed from Nexus shortly after I downloaded it, so this is for those who have a copy or their own LE port. This mod adds 42 dragons to the game with vanilla-based skins that have been swapped for consistency with Dragons SE using D4D's assets. You should not install this mod for its dragon diversity, since D4D already covers this feature, and the "support" being offered here does not include new meshes for these dragons, it simply reuses the ones you are already getting from D4D. Only install this mod alongside D4D if you like the unique breaths/shouts/stats of its dragons, the custom loot, or its NPC protection function. **For the "No Serpentine Replacer" version of D4D, any of this mod's dragons that were based on the vanilla Serpentine model retain their original appearance, except for Vuljotnaak.**﻿[[color=#6d9eeb]**KS Dragon Overhaul 2**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19051)﻿[/color]
  
SpoilerThis mod adds 1 dragon to the game with a vanilla-based skin. Through its "Variants" option (on by default in its MCM, under "Misc"), this mod also redistributes copies of vanilla dragon textures across the vanilla dragon meshes to create inexpensive pseudo-variety. These have all been swapped for consistency with Dragons SE using D4D's assets. You should not install this mod for its dragon diversity, since D4D already covers this feature, and the "support" being offered here does not include new meshes for these dragons, it simply reuses the ones you are already getting from D4D. Only install this mod if it is your overhaul of choice for dragon combat/AI/breaths/shouts/stats, etc.

  
  

**THE ONLY MODS THAT NEEDED CONFLICT RESOLUTION**
  
[**Dragon War - A Dragon Overhaul**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51310)﻿
  
SpoilerMost mods like this don't need any additional support to work with D4D, but due to the extensive changes within this mod, some minor adjustments had to be made via SkyPatcher to make sure named dragons drop the intended amount of loot.[**Dragon Races of Skyrim**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/159377)﻿
  
SpoilerThis mod assigns **new races** to all vanilla dragons. Any skin/armor in Skyrim needs to have a race data entry matching the race of the NPC wearing it, otherwise it turns the wearer invisible. A patch is necessary to add the new race data to D4D's skins so that the two mods can work together. **Make sure you install and activate the D4D patch from Dragon Races of Skyrim's FOMOD in order for the accompanying SkyPatcher configs in D4D's files to take effect! Also please note that D4D's Dragons SE support configs for mods like DDC and Deadly Dragons are not built to work with Dragon Races of Skyrim and its D4D patch!**This is due to the complex compatibility issues of multiple dragon races, and cannot be helped without making an additional patch from scratch. **D4D is already giving your dragons skin diversity, so you don't need to install DDC or Deadly Dragons for that reason in the first place.**

  
  

**REDUNDANT MODS (DO NOT INSTALL):**

[**Dragon Variance**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/134748)﻿
  
SpoilerTechnically, this mod is not incompatible nor entirely redundant with D4D, but it doesn't make much sense to install them together. **The goal of D4D is to make sure that all of your dragons (vanilla and modded) are consistent with (i.e., look like) the ones from Dragons SE, but with more diverse colors and models**. Dragon Variance, on the other hand, intends to make your game evenly mixed with the vanilla model and the models from 3 mods, including Dragons SE. If you install Dragon Variance with D4D, some of your random dragon spawns would still be mixed (because I'm guessing Dragon Variance takes over the vanilla leveled list to distribute NPC dragons), but you would no longer see the vanilla model in your game, and instead most dragon spawns will look only as intended by Dragons SE and D4D. **In other words, installing D4D will ruin (or at least severely skew) what Dragon Variance is trying to accomplish.** But you can do with this information as you will for your own game, since you took the time to read it.[﻿**Deadly Dragons - Vanilla Dragon Models (Dragons SE Compatibility)**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/132807)

**INCOMPATIBLE MODS (DO NOT INSTALL):**

[**Splendor - Dragon Variants SE**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9670) 
  
SpoilerThe only feature of this mod is to distribute more diverse appearances to the vanilla dragon model. D4D is based on Dragons SE, not the vanilla dragon model, and D4D already provides the same feature as this mod. Therefore, it is entirely redundant to install both, and they are fundamentally incompatible.﻿[[color=#ea9999]**Infinite Dragon Variants**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74983)﻿

Therefore, it is entirely redundant to install both, and they are fundamentally incompatible.
  
Any other mods that add any new vanilla dragon meshes/textures to the game that I have not mentioned in the **List of All Supported Mods** will *likely* result in a **consistency conflict** (not a direct conflict) if you install it alongside Dragon SE (or any other dragon remodel for that matter). But I tried to include support for every mod on Nexus where it made sense.

[SkyPatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106659)

  

**INSTALLATION**:

After Installing the requirements, simply install D4D **(one main file + one texture file)** with your mod manager and load its assets (meshes/textures) below Dragons SE. D4D's plugin's position in you load order does not matter, and it does not need patches for anything! It contains only the unique skin (ARMA/ARMO/OTFT) records for dragons and does not overwrite any vanilla or other mod records. 
  
**Make sure D4D's plugin is active after you first install it**!

  

**INFO: D4D Main File - No Serpentine Replacer**SpoilerThis version of D4D is for those who prefer the vanilla aesthetic for the Dragonborn DLC dragons. This version does **not** replace the Serpentine Dragon with the new black dragon models, and it does **not** rename them. Sahrotaar is also **removed** from unique skin distribution, so he will appear **the same as generic Serpentine Dragons that spawn from the vanilla leveled lists**. But I didn't want users of this version to miss out on a chunk of the variety that D4D offers, so in this version, **Ancient Dragons will all spawn as the black variants**, with **only Elder Dragons remaining red** as shown in the screenshots.

Spoiler[Chaos Dragon 4thUnknown Dragon Edit](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/136502)D4D would not have been possible without this mod by PLSET! It is so much more than just a mesh replacement consistency patch between 4thUnknown's dragon model, and the mod [Chaos Dragons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24788)﻿. Be sure to try it out if you like Chaos Dragons and want to use it with Dragons SE! It works seamlessly with D4D.

**NOTE**: D4D already replaces vanilla serpentine dragons, so the replacer from the above mod is not needed.
  
If you do install the serpentine replacer from the above mod and overwrite the main version of D4D, it will replace [**Sahrotaar**](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Sahrotaar)﻿'s appearance only. If you install the "No Serpentine Replacer" version of D4D, then the above mod's mesh will replace all serpentine dragons, including Sahrotaar.
