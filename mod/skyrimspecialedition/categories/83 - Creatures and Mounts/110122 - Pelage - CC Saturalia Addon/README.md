# Pelage - CC Saturalia Addon

[font=Times New Roman]**~~~Main Features~~~**
  
  
CC Saturalia transformed with the illusion of 3D fur, through use of shell texturing techniques similar to those of [fluffworks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56361)﻿.
  
In in other words your reindeer steed, his saddle, and all your warm Saturalia gear now have new fluffy meshes. The rideable
  
reindeer uses your installed reindeer textures plus a shell texture, the base shell texture of this mod matches the vanilla texture.
  
The Saturalia outfit meshes provided here use and are shaped to the vanilla body mesh. Shell texture patches and bodyslides for
  
a few popular body mods will be provided [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/110126)﻿. The base shell textures for the outfit don't need any patching at this time, and
  
match fine with the two currently available outfit retextures. There are two different ground meshes for the hat to choose from:
  
one lays flat like the original and the other is 3D and propped up. I liked them both and couldn't decide, the choice is yours.
  
 There is no esp/esl in this mod, just replacement meshes and some textures. Please enjoy, thanks for reading.
