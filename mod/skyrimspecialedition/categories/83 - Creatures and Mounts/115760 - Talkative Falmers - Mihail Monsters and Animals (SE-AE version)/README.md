[/font][/left][font=Times New Roman]*"Talkative Falmers" adds 14 new immersive lines of custom Falmeri dialogue and 3 types of clicking echolocation noises to the fallen Snow Elves of the deep, making your battles against them more tense and scary. (check the lines on the video above)*[/font][font=Times New Roman]*- The 14 lines are spoken during combat, as a form of taunt, in addition, 5 of them can also be spoken randomly when a Falmer enters combat;
  
  
- The lines of dialogue, except for two lines spoken in rudimentary Tamrielic and aimed directly at making the enemy understand his position and faith by declaring him an intruder or that he will become a slave to the hive, are spoken entirely in Falmeris, the official language of the ancient Snow Elves. I didn't see any point in Falmers talking to each other and their victims in Tamrielic, due to their isolated society, so I made them use Falmeris, but because they are creatures corrupted and mutated by the ages and the new lifestyle they adopted, I decided to give a more feral tone to their speech, with less refinement in the pronunciation of words and with more grammatical simplification, in addition to some changes in some specific words, for a more ghoulish tone. Because we do not have a wide official vocabulary in Falmeris, I created some of the words, although most are in fact official Falmeris, nonetheless, the created words respect the canonical Falmeris style and fully fit into the context, and can even be considered a creation of the dialect of the now corrupted Falmers, not necessarily originating from the original Falmeris, despite fitting perfectly into it.
  
  
- The echolocation clicking noises, in 3 variants, are part of vanilla content originally planned but not implemented in the final version. These original sounds are in the game files and were implemented by me in this mod. They can be used during combat by the Falmers to detect your position, or when they go on alert with the approach of enemies, to locate them.
  
  
- The mod adds lines of dialogue to male and female Falmers, as the sounds produced by them are basically unisex in vanilla.*

This mod is compatible with almost all mods that affect Falmers (including model replacers) in some way, including those that add new sounds to them. The new lines of dialogue are directly attached to the Falmer's race entrance, shared by all vanilla Falmers, [/font][font=Times New Roman]therefore being the most sensible method possible for their application. Also, creatures that share the vanilla Falmer "voice type" (sounds suchs as the sounds produced when you hit or kill them) won't use the new lines just because they share the vanilla sound effects of the Falmer. Besides that, no matter if the new creatures use Falmer animations, attacks, idles, or whatever, they will not have the Falmer' unique lines of dialogue. So, you don't need to worry about incompatibilities.[/font][/left][left][font=Times New Roman]
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
