![](https://i.imgur.com/PwJxVUw.png)*Add-on for my Cow Replacer mod, adding 8 more high quality variants of cow to the game, with highly detailed models, 4k textures and 2k normal maps. The new variants are scattered around the world along with the vanilla cow, replaced in my original mod.
  
  
Requires the original mod ''Cow Replacer'' ([LE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/115117/)﻿/ [SE-AE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/87958)﻿).*[/font][/left][left][font=Times New Roman]![](https://i.imgur.com/XwFuxsS.png)

[/font][/left][left][font=Times New Roman]﻿The mod is not compatible with other mods that modify the textures or model of vanilla Cows. If you have one installed, or think you might have one, put this mod below it/them in your load order. If [/font][font=Times New Roman]you are asked about files overwriting those of other mods, press "Yes to all".[/font][font=Times New Roman]
  
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
