Description
  
This ESL flagged mod introduces custom hand-sculpted, photo realistic Whitetail Bucks, Does, and Fawns, along with Blacktail Deer that are regionally distributed across Skyrim’s diverse environments. The mod dynamically alters the spawning behavior of Elk, Reindeer, and various Deer species to reflect regional diversity.

[/size]Whats Included
  

  
* Whitetail Deer: Whitetail Bucks, Does, and Fawns have been added to various regions of Skyrim, each with their own custom photo realistic meshes and textures.
Blacktail Deer: Blacktail Bucks and Does are now available, adding further variety to the fauna
  
* New Deer Pelts: All newly added deer have unique custom pelts

  
**Regional Spawning**

  
* Plains of Skyrim: Elk spawns are now more common than Reindeer, adding more regional diversity to the open plains
Forests of Skyrim: Whitetail Does and Fawns will now spawn more frequently in forested areas, while Whitetail Bucks and Reindeer spawn rarely. Elk will never spawn in these areas
  
* Marshes of Skyrim: Elk, Reindeer, and Whitetail Bucks will commonly spawn in marshes, Whitetail Does will rarely spawn and Fawns will not appear in the Marshes at all however
Canyons of Skyrim: Canyons will be populated with goats and occasionally Blacktail Deer
  
  

**Customization Options**

  
* Choose between Fantasy Whitetail Doe and Realistic Whitetail Doe textures during installation.
Select from 4K or 2K detail normal maps to customize the visual fidelity of the deer.
  
* As of version 1.6 users will not have the option to choose from a Fluffworks patched version of the Blacktail deer and a standard version which does not use fluffworks

  
**Other Features**

  
* The mod is ESL flagged so it does not take up a slot in your load order
A Skypatcher version of the mod is offered eliminating the need for patches completely. Additionally a non-Skypatcher version is also offered. 
  
* Can be installed at any point in your game, whether starting fresh or adding to an existing save
In specifically the SkyTEST Lite version of the mod I have placed 3 unique un-killable deer Pickle the fawn, Mooma, and Grandma. These are the only friendly deer in the game and are hidden in a forest off of a path and represent 3 real life deer I saw daily on my walks in the forest. 
  

  
  
  
  
Compatibility
  
-If the standard version of the mod is selected then place this mod after any mod that alters deer spawns and the mod will work as expected. To be specific only 4 deer spawn records (plains, Marsh, Canyon, and Forest) were altered.
  
[size=3]-If the Skypatcher version of this mod is selected then no patch is required and the mod will work without the need of a load order change or patch.
  
  
\*NOTE: I highly recommend user use [Better Female Elk](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97006?tab=posts&BH=0) along with this mod and have the small antlers fully removed from the female elk thus allowing the user to continue to get small antlers but from Whitetail Deer instead. Additionally I recommend [Frank Blacks Slightly Better Small Antlers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/83672) to provide consistency with the antlers you can harvest and the antlers you see on the deer/pelts. This is not required at all but goes a long way in terms of immersion.

**Special Thanks**
  
I personally spent a year working on the meshes and textures to improve them and get them to work well in Skyrim but still I ran into a number of walls and wouldn't have been successful without the help of the following people:
  
  
-Special thanks to HasphatAntobolis for helping me with the initial conversion and skinning of the meshes into Skyrim he is a very talented author and I recommend you check out his work
  
-Special thanks to NamoriLabs who is a professional AAA studio mesh and texture developer who finalized skinning of the meshes for me to ensure animation movements were flawless. She is incredibly talented and wonderful to work with
  
-Special thanks to Zira1251 for taking the initial screenshots for me to use in the mod page saving me so much time and energy when I have so little left to give
  
-Special thanks to LordWushin for helping me write up the description page for this mod again it saved me time and energy I just don't have right now
  
-Special thanks to Nyi Nyi Tun for the original reference mesh and texture that was leveraged for the project
  
-Special thanks to 530gothic25 for having open permission for the original Blacktail deer textures which I modified
  
-Special thanks to Frank Black for his Better Hides and Antlers mods and being so giving to the community with permissions I leveraged the hide meshes and deer antlers for this mod
