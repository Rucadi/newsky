[/font][font=Times New Roman][font=Times New Roman][size=4]"Imps are small pesky winged humanoids of moderate intelligence. They can cast basic shock and fire spells in combat, but while a lone Imp is a nuisanse in its own right, they are only especially dangerous in groups. They inhabit nearly every province of Tamriel, and are most commonly found around ruins, caves, and dungeons, and are highly aggressive.
  
  
The Imp's origins are not clearly known. Most scholars consider them a type of Faerie, alongside Sprites, Nixads, Sylphim, among others. Some sources also suggest they may be daedric beings, while others claim they are artificial alchemical constructs such as the Homonculus. In general, most scholars with academic credibility believe the first theory, classifying the Imps as a type of nature spirit and part of the mortal world, in the same class that, more broadly, also includes not only Fairies but also Gorons, Spriggans, Nymphs and many other beings little understood by the other mortal races of Nirn.
  
  
They can be found in several variants, living alone or alongside animals or Spriggans, but some Imp gangs can also be found. The leaders of these groups are usually stronger Imps with special magical abilities and power.
  
  
Imps use a very primitive and incomprehensible language known as Impish. Some old tales tell of scholars able to speak it, thus calming the Imps to avoid combat, with some even being able to have simple conversations with them. Unfortunately in present times, there is little or no knowledge about this primitive language."

(\*Who is Beastmaster Mihail? He is my avatar/persona within the universe composed of all my mods. He is the ingame author who writes the texts that are usually presented as descriptions for my mods. A former monster hunter, now a dedicated scholar, he is planned to be released as an NPC in late 2022/early 2023, doing the same job in-game as my descriptions do on Nexus.)
  
  
[/font][font=Times New Roman]A final small note: the now-defunct card game Tes Legends made a mistake by publishing the first Imp card as daedra. Then they fixed this and created the unique "Imp" class for new cards for these creatures. This is just another inconsistency and error in the lore of Tes Legends, among many others, and we shouldn't give it any importance. Tes Legends is not a good source of knowledge, it has broken the established canon countless times, and it has always been made by third parties with little real knowledge (and apparently little interest too) about the history of the franchise.

[font=Times New Roman]So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

* [font=Times New Roman][color=#f4f4f4]What made it possible to create the Imp with animated working wings was an ingenious mix of skeletons and animations. The wings in particular are attached as a special effect, and animated by an external set of bones. This means that at the time of the Imp's death, I was faced with two different scenarios: either the wings simply disappear when the Imp is killed (like a magical cloak disappears when the mage who produced it dies), or they remain flapping permanently, which wouldn't be good either. I found a middle ground for the sake of your immersion: after death, the Imp's wings flap for a little period of time (long enough for you to collect the loot and move on), and then they disappear. In terms of immersion, consider the temporary flapping of wings after the Imp's death to be involuntary reflexes, similar to a gecko's severed tail, or octopus tentacles that move even after being cut. Options like transforming into an ash pile don't make sense for this creature, and the tests I did to replace the live model with animated wings with a dead model with static wings at the time of death didn't prove to be worth the effort they would require;

[/font][font=Times New Roman]It has been reported by some users who have installed mods that add animated wings to the playable character, that both types of wings can semi-blend into a weird bug, causing you to at certain times develop Imp wings on your back instead of wings that you intended to use, such as fairy or dragon ones, added by other mods. It's not quite clear how this bug works, but maybe it's due to animations and other files shared between mods. If you don't use mods for that purpose then you have nothing to worry about.[/font]

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
