*Bundle in a single .esp of my Vampire Lord Expansion, Vampire Beasts and Foglings mods. Make vampires one of the most, if not the most, fearsome group of monstrosities you can face in Skyrim, turning your game into a gothic nightmare as you explore the most evil caves and dungeons.**From Vampire Lord Expansion description page:*
  
  
"Vampire Lords are a powerful type of vampiric entity, many of them pure-blooded, having received vampirism directly from Molag Bal, which gives them powers above average among their peers, and the possibility of transforming into a monstrous winged form, humanoid in shape with bat-like features, and great power. These extremely intelligent and powerful creatures can shift between their original mortal forms and the Vampire Lord form at will, and are capable of using powerful blood and shock magic. Excellent mages, they are capable of summoning the most terrible vampiric creatures such as Garkains and Fleders from Coldharbour and create ghostly, poisonous, and life-sucking red shades to aid them in combat. Furthermore, their sharp claws have venom, albeit a relatively light one.
  
  
However, it should be noted that not all Vampire Lords received the direct gift from Molag Bal, with several being descendants of those who received it directly, or powerful vampires who are part of their courts, since, in general, due to their status and power, most Vampire Lords become important members, or even leaders, of Vampire clans. Nonetheless, it is worth mentioning that the ability to transform into the monstrous winged form of a Vampire Lord, and all the powers associated with it, can only be transmitted if the infecting vampire wishes to pass the blessing/curse to the infected person, and if not, it will only infect the victim with some type of vampirism considered as low tier among the ranks of Vampire Lords.
  
  
On Nirn, finding Vampire Lords, and their Vampire Mistress consorts, is no easy task, as most live in secluded castles far from civilization, or deep, inaccessible caverns. In addition, the vast majority reside in Coldharbour, only entering Nirn sporadically to check on their subordinates or evil projects. These Lords have skin of a greenish gray color, small wings, and they are barely larger than a human when transformed.
  
  
Some clans, especially the more religious and fanatical ones, are led by, or have as an important member of their courts, really ancient Vampire Lords, usually larger, with a large wingspan as well, and dark skin covered in runic markings. These vampires are very old, and in general they are not kings or great lords in command of large armies, nor do they have an interest on that, but they are priests of religious orders strongly linked to blood magic and Molag Bal himself, having their interest more focused on a ritualistic and spiritual view of vampirism, rather than using it for self-benefit, dominion and power, as most Vampire Lords and their vampire armies do.
  
  
A strange type called the Skeletal Vampire Lord also seems to exist, but it is unknown why they remained using their reanimated bones after having their bodies destroyed, rather than traveling to Coldharbour in soul. These can raise other Vampire Lords bone remains to aid them in combat and are formidable enemies like their "living" comrades."

*From Vampire Beasts description page:*"While most vampire beasts fit into the group of lesser vampires, this description can be misleading, as inferior does not necessarily mean weak. It is true that they are generally primitive and behave like animals, but when they fall on their prey from above, they can be just as dangerous as their more noble cousins. With the exception of animals turned vampire, most vampiric beasts hail directly from Coldharbour, originally living in its deepest, darkest caverns and ruins, until conjured on the mortal plane by higher vampires, to spread terror among men.
  
  
  
Of all the vampiric monstrosities, 7 are particularly often described, both for their occurrence and for the ferocity and danger they pose to anyone who encounters them:

Garkains, like Fleders, belong to a class of particularly dangerous vampires whose strength exceeds even that of Trolls and Ogres. An encounter with one of their kind almost always ends in death, which is why there aren't many eyewitness accounts of them. From the Hjaalmarch guard's reports, written to describe attacks committed on Morthal years ago by three Garkains (later killed by a certain Redguard mage known as Falion), it appears that these hideous monsters are not content to drink the blood of their victims. Investigators have concluded from the blood and guts scattered around the crime scenes that Garkains rip their victims to shreds with great delight and muck about in their bloody entrails. Garkains belong to the group of creatures known as lesser vampires. They often gather around themselves members of other lesser vampire species, acting in such situations as pack leaders. They are large creatures, and incapable of fast running, during combat they usually attempt to incapacitate prey using a pulse blast of energy created by their large eardrum sacs causing an intense vibration that stuns and disorients. Their claws produce a weak poison, which in front of so many other lethal abilities, make them a point of minor importance, in the vast arsenal of this beast. Garkains are considered vampire beasts of moderate intelligence, comparable to that of a Troll;
  
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/MkDkHqS.jpg)﻿
  
  
Pack leaders among the Garkains are known as Alpha Garkains. They wear rudimentary clothing and props as a display of status. They are larger and more powerful than a common Garkain, their skin is greenish and the purple tympanic sacs on their heads produce a faint glow. They have spikes growing along their bodies, especially on their backs. Unlike the normal Garkains, Alpha Garkains are considered to be vampire beasts of moderately advanced intelligence by the standards of vampire beasts;
  
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/jtpQAfm.jpg)﻿
  
  
Fleders cannot be mistaken for any other creature (except perhaps the Werebats), with their wide, toothy jaws, flat, unpleasant bat-like faces and completely hairless, often warty blue bodies. These vampires fight ferociously with their sharp teeth and claws, flailing them blindly and not stopping even when their victim is already dead. Even a solitary Fleder is strong enough to take down a trained soldier. Compared to other vampire beasts, Fleders display meager intelligence. When fighting Fleders, special attention must be paid to their behavior: these creatures do not move particularly fast, but they will use their sonar, which is powerful enough to disarm their victims.
  
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/Gkn59Gn.jpg)﻿
  
  
Protofleder is a very rare form of Fleder that has been documented to this day only in the darkest and most remote caves of the Forgotten Valley in Skyrim, by the few who managed to find a way into this mysterious place and get out alive, usually resorting to levitation magic and teleportation. They emit a red glow from their bodies and are usually covered in the blood of their victims. These Fleders are believed to be the most primitive subspecies of this species, which originated in the deepest and darkest caves of Molag Bal's realm, where absolutely no light enters, and that the so-called common Fleders are an evolution of these albino Fleders, when some of these started to approach levels closer to the surface. Members of this subspecies are characterized by their considerable strength as well as the strange glow they emit, a trait likely linked to their nature as deep cave dwellers who live all their lifes in complete darkness. As far as is known, the Protofleders never had significant contact with the outside world, not even with the other inhabitants of Coldharbour, and likely share with their bluish cousins the same lack of acceptable levels of intelligence;

Katakans may display many monstrous bat-like traits, but they are the only ones on this list that cannot be considered lesser vampires. These are bestial vampires no doubt, but by no means creatures of little intelligence. They are actually a transformation that the vampire blood can cause in some sentient vampires as they delve deep into the more bestial side of vampirism, forgetting rational interests, and focusing only on satisfying their most primal instincts. Despite this transformation, they retain their intelligence and ability to speak. Some of them are also able to disguise themselves using some sort of illusion or alteration magic and acting like normal humans in public and in the presence of their victims. They are, however, somewhat wilder than the rest of the high vampires. In combat they are very clever users of invisibility, to ambush their unsuspecting prey, they are also capable of commanding swarms of bats and great users of blood magic, knowing many drain-type spells. They have long claws that continue to grow throughout their lives, which are also to be feared. They differ from Werebats due to the fact that the latter are vampires bestowed by Hircine with the werebeast's blessing, which combined with vampire blood produces the Werebat transformation. Both are vampires focused on bestial instincts, but while the Katakans seem to fully embrace the bestial side of their condition to its fullest extent and live it permanently, the vampires contemplated with the man-bat transformation were vampires primarily focused solely on the lust of the hunt, and yet clearly more civilized than the Katakans, only transforming at specific times to sate their bloodlust, and reverting to their humanoid forms after the bloody nights of hunting. Katakans also completely differ from Bloodfiends. Especially weak vampires become Feral Vampires after a while, when they start to become unable to control themselves. At this stage, their minds have been known to degrade to the point of insanity, later leaving a raging husk of a mindless creature commonly called a Bloodfiend. Katakans however are far from weak-minded or out of control, being only particularly prone to bestiality;
  
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/5mXUc0m.jpg)﻿
  
  
If a regular Katakan is already dangerous, a very old Katakan, mutated into this form perhaps millennia ago, has already mastered all the possibilities and abilities that the path of bestiality can offer to a vampire. They are larger and stronger than normal Katakans, and have longer, darker beards, and paler skin.
  
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/klC2Y8C.jpg)﻿
  
  
An Ekimmara is nothing more than the result of a not-so-powerful vampire diving deep into the bestial side of vampirism, fully embracing its meanings and way of living, but doesn't having a strong enough mind to handle it properly. Ekimmaras end up losing their sentient minds and ability to speak, and begin to act and think like normal lesser vampire beasts. They are smaller than Katakans and, despite being similar, have less raw power and use fewer magical abilities. Their appearance is similar to their larger and more intelligent cousins, but displaying less hair, particularly on their beards, and their colors are much more vivid. They also don't wear jewelry commonly, and their head horns are much smaller. Despite this, they are still smarter and more dangerous than Bloodfiends, standing halfway between the latter and the Katakans. Their intelligence is believed to be similar to that of a Garkain."

*From Foglings description page:*"The pesky Foglings are undead goblin-like creatures, vampiric in nature. They belong to the lesser vampire ranks that roam across Coldharbour. Not specially smart, they seem to lack the skills to deal with the powers of vampirism properly, as observed by scholars. Proves of that can be seen simply looking at their behavior: despite being vampires, they can be seen outside at day, what burns their skin painfully, nevertheless they remain going outside during daytime and they simply self-mutilate themselves with their claws trying to stop the pain caused by their skin being hardly burned by the sunlight. Because that, Foglings have huge holes on their torsos and several of their internal organs and bones were simply mutilated by themselves.
  
  
Another proof pointed by scholars that they are not able to deal with the vampirism effects is the fact that they seem to be unable to use the invisibility powers properly too. Because some lack of magical ability, they cast on themselves some kind of permanent half-invisibility spell that makes them live permanently on a semi-ethereal state. They cant use properly the advantages of a well casted vampiric invisibility spell, nonetheless that permanent semi-ethereal physical condition makes them 50% resistent to all types of damage.
  
  
Their adaptation was, despite all the disadvantages, very good, because they use the permanent mist around them and their not completely tangible form to create ambushes to their victims. Nords tells that the sight of glowing yellow lights on the swamps or forests at night is not a signal of fireflies, and you must run from there as fast as you can, because they are the glowing eyes of the Foglings, that already have seen you too.
  
  
Used as minions by other types of more intelligent vampires, you can find them wandering Coldharbour, Soul Cairn, and also commonly in vampire lairs on Nirn. Some also seek protection living close to some lone Hagravens on the Reach, offering their service to the feathered hags. Scholars do not know much more about the Foglings because its impossible to aproach them without risks and because its also commonly impossible to deal with their masters, the vampires, to ask them questions regarding that matter, or about other themes much more interesting than walking goblin corpses. But a big part of them believe that Foglings are just Goblins that have contracted Sanguinaris Vampiris or another form of vampirism, and became undead, pretty much like the process when a human becomes a vampire. But because goblins are just simple-minded creatures, they usually do not become true masters of the vampirism, only self-mutilated insane beasts that exist permanentely in a unstable and cursed magical state. The poor "life" of this creatures and their absolute inexistent skills to deal with the powers and traits of vampirism seem to justify that statement. 
  
  
The vampire dust produced by Foglings is specially more powerfull than the regular vampire dust, possibly due to the incessant use of vampiric abilities applied to themselves, albeit in a clumsy way."

This mod does not affect player transformation, so textures, skeletons, animation replacer, skills, etc., that you use for the Vampire Lord, will not be affected by this mod. It also doesn't affect Harkon, so whatever you use on him will stay the same. The only exception is that it gives Harkon the ability to duplicate himself into Vampire Shades in combat, and adds a daedra heart to his loot. The Vampire Lords used in this mod are standalone and have their own skeleton, their own skills and use different textures each (2k resolution), however, this mod gives the Vampire Lord transformations added by this mod not only to some new powerful vampires, but also for some important vanilla boss vampires, so in order for you not to run the risk of losing access to some of them due to incompatibility with other mods that also modify the same vampires, I recommend that you create a Batched Patch;[/font]
  
[font=Times New Roman]
  
[/font][font=Times New Roman]This mod is affected by [True Death - A Vampire Slaying Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/23890/)﻿ if you use both together. It makes vampire beasts suffer from the same mechanics as vanilla vampire npcs, regarding the method to kill them, as explained in this part of the mentioned mod's description: *"NPC vampires will not be able to be killed unless you A. Get a 1 hit kill. or B. Weaken them first through Silver weaponry/ammo or two particular spells.**Once weakened use a wooden stake on them to finish the job. You only have 30 seconds to stake them before they recover. This makes Vampires far more dangerous and requires that you carry the tools to deal with them AT ALL TIMES or risk being killed or chased off. Wooden Stakes and Silver-Tipped Arrows/Bolts can be crafted at a forge. Save your Silver and Fire Salts."*[/font]
  
[font=Times New Roman][/font][/size](OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

* [font=Times New Roman]Although rare, a bug can occur in which a Vampire Lord does not enter combat mode. In some cases, he goes into combat mode after a few seconds, but in others, he just doesn't react. However, this is very rare, and is due to the fact that the Vampire Lords' AI was not programmed for enemies, but only for a highly scripted battle (Harkon) and for player use.[/font]

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.

![](https://i.imgur.com/bFFhLJ6.png)﻿*Update on Deadlands development:**unfortunately I will be postponing the release of the Project Deadlands first open alpha test to late January 2023. It was initially planned for late September 2022, and later postponed to mid-October of the same year, but circumstances have been delaying me, so instead of delaying it again by another month when October ends, and then by one more at the end of November, I prefer to put a more realistic date already. Unfortunately I have been facing personal, financial and mainly family problems (which end up becoming financial too) that prevent me from being able to dedicate full time to the project at this moment, so I will focus on these remaining 3 months of the year on faster and smaller jobs, so I will continue to be active, and I will not stop producing content, and then on January 1st, with everything more stabilized in my life, I will be able to dedicate myself fully to the project. As I've shared it several times, mainly on my server, I'm not only investing time and effort, but the project also costs money, and right now I can't afford it, nor can I dedicate full time to it. I work practically alone, I do almost everything myself, and it's not feasible for me to continue developing the project this year. Thank you for understanding, and unfortunately unforeseen events arise, and a sequence of them occurred to me in the second half of the year, so I need this end of year to balance things out first. You can check more info about the mod bellow.*-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
*New quest mod coming soon:**The mod's first open alpha test release was initially planned for late September/2022 but was pushed back to end of January/2023 for better polish. The several hours long adventure takes place mostly in Oblivion, specially on the Deadlands, and is intended for the Champion of Mehrunes Dagon, however, several of the objectives include interaction with other realms and daedra, even in places outside of Oblivion itself: you will travel between dungeons, open areas, underground caves, towns, gigantic daedric towers, and much more.
  
In January/23 I will relese the first open alpha for community testing and bug finding, also as a show of respect to the users, since the project will take a full year yet to be completed, and i want people to know that the project is being developed, and also providing them a place to have fun while waiting, and at same time this will help me with bug finding, and with ideas for improvment. Quest has 30 acts, each new alpha will feature 3 new acts. Open Alpha Test 1 will feature only the first 3 acts, but already with several hours of content. I plan to release a total of 9 to 10 alphas before the finished release.*
  
  
*Oblivion Gate test*
  
[﻿](https://youtu.be/1iSHwYh6_y0)*(First test made on testing cell with vanilla interior dungeon lightning, second test made on vanilla
  
dagon shrine with natural exterior world lightning. I was not happy with my first try (showcased on
  
the video of the first gate test I published time ago), so i came back and redone the oblivion gate
  
effects and sounds, and now i like them much more.)*
  
  
*Oblivion Gate test 2﻿*
  
  
*(Final test just to see how daedra exiting the gate would look like. No daedra will come from this gate, but*
  
*later on the mod they will come from others, while already in oblivion, specially when travelling between*
  
*realms and/or pocket realms. Check the previous testing to see the full working mechanics of the*
  
*Oblivion Gates on the mod.)*
  
  
*Mythic Dawn Archvicar lines*
  
  
*(He is the second main NPC of the mod, with Agent Ragna being the first and the central npc of the introdutory
  
quest "The Sigils of Oblivion". After finishing it, you start the main one, "The Herald of the Second Coming",
  
and is the Archivar who introduces you to the adventure. (he is using right now my 4k re-texture of Mythic
  
Dawn Robes, but in the finished version he will receive unique "Mythic Dawn Priest Robes", although
  
they will not be featured yet on the first open alpha testing release))*
  
  
  
*Interaction with Dagon at Azrak'ath Ruins*
  
  
*(First communication with Dagon in the end of the introdutory quest "The Sigils of Oblivion". After you
  
collect the sigil stone you travel to his shrine to enter the gate to the Deadlands. (video is a bit outdated,
  
on current state the eyes of dagon glow in fire when you approach and he starts talking))*
  
  
  
*Azrak'ath Ruins boss fight (end of act 1 of 30)*
  
  
*(Final boss of the Azrak'ath Ruins. These ruins are underground Daedric ruins on Nirn, more specifically on the Reach. Here
  
you complete Act 1 of the mod, and most of the remaining 29 acts take place in Oblivion, about 80% of them in the Deadlands.
  
In act 1 the introductory quest The Sigils of Oblivion occurs, where you collect the Sigil Stone that will be used to open the Oblivion
  
Gate that I showed in previous videos. When you enter the gate the main quest The Herald of the Second Coming will then begin.)*
  
  
*Azrak'ath Ruins Mythic Dawn ghosts in the end of act 1*
  
  
*(At the end of Act 1, still on Nirn, in an underground daedric ruin, after you finish the dungeon and acquire the
  
ritualistic Sigil Stone, several Mythic Dawn ghosts who were killed in this ruin during the Oblivion Crisis,
  
during an attack by Vigilants of Stendarr, appear to motivate you to go ahead and carry out Dagon's plans,
  
which start with the Dragonborn opening a portal to Oblivion.)*
