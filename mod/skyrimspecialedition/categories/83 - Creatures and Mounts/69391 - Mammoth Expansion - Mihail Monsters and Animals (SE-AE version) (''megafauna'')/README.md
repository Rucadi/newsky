[/font][font=Times New Roman]﻿"Although usually known as peaceful giants of the tundra, if a female Mammoth can be already absurdly dangerous to defend her calf from danger, few animals in Skyrim come close to the terror that a male Mammoth  in Musth can pose to the unfortunate who cross his path on the snowy tundra.
  
  
While the tamed female Mammoths usually live around the Giants' camps, grazing in groups and taking care of all the Mammoth Calfs together, the males however, much larger and with a more aggressive and territorial behavior, prefer to live solitary lifes in more remote and isolated areas, in the icy tundra to the north, descending to lower altitudes only when in heat, also known as Musth. During this period, the males, which are naturally out of choice for domestication by the Giants who herd the females and their calfs by the reasons mentioned above, become even more dangerous, and can attack the Giants themselves, and even the small calfs. To avoid major problems with the territorial males, the Giants tend to keep females in heat away from their herding fields, so that they can mate without the males getting too close to the herds."

For reasons of consistency, and for the very identity and purpose of the mod, this mod is incompatible with mods that modify the textures, models or skeleton of vanilla mammoths. It is also incompatible with mods that modify their loot.
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
