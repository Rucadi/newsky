# Giantesses Around Skyrim

There are three types of regular giants in the vanilla game. Whenever a giant spawns, it randomly picks one of the three. This mod will add three slots for giantesses to spawn in addition to the male giants, so that all 3 males can coexist with the females rather than having to replace some of them.
  
  
More specifically, anywhere a Giant would spawn, there is a 33% chance of it being a Giantess instead.
  
  
This mod was designed with PsBoss' [New Female Giant](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78049) and [New Female Giant Dressed](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78145)﻿ in mind - with the three slots being added specifically with the intention of using the default model, the topless model, and the dressed model. However, due to the closed permissions on all of his work, I'm unable to include his models directly. This download only includes copies of the vanilla models as a failsafe, with instructions on how to replace them with other models.
  
  
That being said, you can use any female giant model from any mod you wish - it will work regardless, so long as you rename it properly.﻿
  
  
It takes reading and a few extra steps to make this work properly - if that's something you can't do, I recommend you do not download it.
  
  
Bug reports have been disabled as of 1/18/23 due to multiple reports of "it doesn't work" from people who clearly did not read the instructions.
