Infinite Dragon Variants is a port and an improved version of [The Dragon Engine](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58813) from LE, and spices up dragons variety by applying tint masks on them.

 • Procedural generated color combinations for dragons
  
 • Optional file to mix dragon skins, similarly to [Splendor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9670), which does not need any patch

By using up to 14 tint masks available, it is possible to get a huge amount of combinations, and should be very rare — if not impossible — to get the same one in a row.

 • Compatible with any dragon retexture
  
 • Incompatible with GoT Dragons, as it requires completely new tint masks
  
 • Built-in compatibility with [Diverse Dragons Collection](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/695) and [Deadly Dragons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23723)
