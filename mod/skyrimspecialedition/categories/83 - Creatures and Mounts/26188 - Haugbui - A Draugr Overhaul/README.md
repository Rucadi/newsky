﻿

Draugr are the second most common enemy in Skyrim. Every other quest takes you to a Nordic ruin where these barrow-dwellers guard their treasures, but there was not as close attention paid to them as there could have been. Unique bosses all share the same armor and design, ancient warriors are shambling about with pristine newer iron shields and, latter on, ebony gear, as well as some just straight up baffling stat distribution on the developers' part.
  
  
What this mod does, is that it tries to address these shortcomings in order to deliver an improved dungeon diving experience.
  
  
**Features:**
  
  
[font=Times New Roman]**DRAUGR REVAMPED:**[/font]
  
- All named bosses now have unique designs taking into account the lore surrounding them.
  
- King Borgas has been added into Korvanjund. Previously, he had only been mentioned in dialogue.
  
- New variations of the Hulking Draugr have been added in. The lower level Savage Draugr, and the higher level Draugr Revenant. All tiers have been given two-handed version as well.
  
- Warlocks have been given Deathlord tier variants.
  
- The spectral draugr in Labyrinthian are now called "Hallowed Dead" and have been given male variants.
  
- Generic bosses have a chance to be female.
  
- A new boss, the Draugr Winter King, can be encountered at about the same time as Dragon Priests.
  
  
**[font=Times New Roman]DRAUGR REBALANCED:
  
[/font]**- Non-Ebony wielding Deathlords have been changed into their own tier, the Draugr Bane.
  
- All Deathlords now use the same Ebony template, instead of just the archers.
  
- Archers will no longer have more health than the other draugr types.
  
  
[font=Times New Roman]**NEW ANCIENT ITEMS:**[/font]
  
- Draugr now use worn out, beat-up dented and rusted iron shields.
  
- Higher tiers of draugr will carry Ancient Ebony and Stalhrim gear that can be upgraded to Nord Hero variants.
  
- Sovngarde NPCs will no longer carry around rusty old Ancient Nord weapons, and instead have Nord Hero.
  
- The Steel Battleaxe of Firey Souls has been changed into a leveled Ancient Nord Battleaxe, and has been given to Warlord Gathrik.
