Lurker have a Breath Attack that is unused in vanilla due to some things not being properly set up. This mod reintegrates the ability and fixes some problems with it.
  
The attack is used in mid-range when the player is not reachable with melee attacks but still reachable with the breath attack. Lurkers will use the other projectile at long-range.
  
  
Some mods already reimplement the breath attacks (e.g. [Requiem Dragonborn Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34829)) but it comes with a whole slew of bugs that are fixed with this mod.
  
  
**Features:***- Restores the Tentacle Breath attack from Lurkers
  
- Rebalanced the damage, and added 4 spell levels
  
- Added proper black goo/tentacle impact/hazard effects
  
- Fixed the tentacle hazard on the ground not doing anything, it now deals damage
  
- Removed the frost effect seen on lurkers while they cast this*
  
  
Includes a [Requiem Dragonborn version](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34829)﻿ that includes the fixes without changing the balance
