**[ [ [ MOD DESCRIPTION ] ] ]****If you're like me and have been disappointed with the vanilla Netches, then this mod is for you.  This mod replaces the vanilla Netch skeleton with a new custom skeleton meant to give the Netches of Solstheim a more menacing, repulsive and alien appearance. Working within the confines of the vanilla mesh, I adjusted the main body and tentacles for a more jellyfish like body-plan. These subtle changes have transformed the vanilla Netches into a  far more alien creature that you'll dread to encounter on the island of Solstheim!**

**[ [ [ MOD COMPATIBILITY ] ] ]****Notorious Netches uses a custom skeleton for the Vanilla Netches and will overwrite any mod that makes changes to the vanilla Netch skeleton.  Mods that make sweeping changes to vanilla skeletons e.g."Realistic Ragdoll and Force"****should be compatible as long as "Notorious Netches" is installed after those mods and allowed to overwrite their files.**
  
  
**Should be fully compatible with any texture mods, since this mod contains no textures or meshes of it's own, only a skeleton.  Which also makes it compatible with most other creature mods that do not edit vanilla skeletons.**
  
  
  
  
  
  
**[ [ [ INSTALLATION ] ] ]****Recommend using Vortex or your favorite mod manager.****Install "Notorious Netches" after any mod that makes changes to the vanilla Netches and  "overwite" any files when prompted.
  
  
  
 There is no ".esp plugin" with this mod.****[ [ [ MY OTHER MODS ] ] ]****If you like this mod then I'm sure you'll enjoy my other mods as well.
