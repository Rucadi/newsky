- "Talkative Dragon Priests" adds 32 new immersive lines of custom dialogue to these powerful undead enemies, making your battles against them more epic, unique and frightening. All Dragon Priests have now several custom lines of dialogue for all possible battle situations, such as taunts, death, losing sight of the enemy, exiting the sarcophagus, and much more. And although most of the lines are shared by all Dragon Priests, most unique named Dragon Priests have specific lines for each one upon awakening from the sarcophagus; (check all the new 32 lines on the videos above)
  
  
- The exceptions are Hevnorak, Morokei and Nahkriin, as in the vanilla game they are the only Dragon Priests with introductory pre-combat dialogue. Even so, these 3 also use the other lines of dialogue added by this mod, during the battle, just not using new lines when leaving the sarcophagus/ before entering the battle, for reasons already explained. Also, I've made sure the new lines are similar to the vanilla lines of those 3, in tone and style, to maintain consistency. (check on the video bellow the vanilla lines used by the 3 mentioned Priests)

This mod is compatible with almost all mods that affect Dragon Priests in some way, including those that add new sounds to them. The new lines of dialogue are directly attached to the "DragonPriestRace" and "DLC2AcolyteDragonPriestRace" (the race used by the Dragon Priests of Solstheim), therefore being the most sensible method possible for their application. That way, creatures that share the vanilla Dragon Priest voice type for example, with the vanilla guttural sounds, won't use the new lines just because they share the vanilla sound effects of the Dragon Priests. Only those modded creatures that were associated in the Creation Kit with the two mentioned vanilla Dragon Priest races will have the new lines, but not creating a new race for new creatures is bad modding practice, and even amateurism, so you will hardly encounter this problem, at least when using my creature mods. Apart from that, no matter if the new creatures use Dragon Priest animations, Dragon Priest attacks, Dragon Priest idles, or whatever, they will not have the Priests' unique lines of dialogue.
  
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.

Additional acknowledgments:Thanks to [Jayserpa](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/5201727)﻿ for converting this mod into .ESL, thus not using an .esp slot anymore, and for teaching me a way to mark mods with dialog as .ESLs in a safe and functional way, something that until then had not been working for me when using methods of traditional ESLfication.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/bFFhLJ6.png)*Update on Deadlands development:**unfortunately I will be postponing the release of the Project Deadlands first open alpha test to late February 2023. It was initially planned for late September 2022, and later postponed to mid-October of the same year, but circumstances have been delaying me, so instead of delaying it again by another month when October ends, and then by one more at the end of November, I prefer to put a more realistic date already. Unfortunately I have been facing personal, financial and mainly family problems (which end up becoming financial too) that prevent me from being able to dedicate full time to the project at this moment, so I will focus on these remaining 3 months of the year on faster and smaller jobs, so I will continue to be active, and I will not stop producing content, and then on January 1st, with everything more stabilized in my life, I will be able to dedicate myself fully to the project. As I've shared it several times, mainly on my server, I'm not only investing time and effort, but the project also costs money, and right now I can't afford it, nor can I dedicate full time to it. I work practically alone, I do almost everything myself, and it's not feasible for me to continue developing the project this year. Thank you for understanding, and unfortunately unforeseen events arise, and a sequence of them occurred to me in the second half of the year, so I need this end of year to balance things out first. You can check more info about the mod bellow.*-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
*New quest mod coming soon:**The mod's first open alpha test release was initially planned for late September/2022 but was pushed back to end of February/2023 for better polish. The several hours long adventure takes place mostly in Oblivion, specially on the Deadlands, and is intended for the Champion of Mehrunes Dagon, however, several of the objectives include interaction with other realms and daedra, even in places outside of Oblivion itself: you will travel between dungeons, open areas, underground caves, towns, gigantic daedric towers, and much more.
  
In February/23 I will relese the first open alpha for community testing and bug finding, also as a show of respect to the users, since the project will take a full year yet to be completed, and i want people to know that the project is being developed, and also providing them a place to have fun while waiting, and at same time this will help me with bug finding, and with ideas for improvment. Quest has 30 acts, each new alpha will feature 3 new acts. Open Alpha Test 1 will feature only the first 3 acts, but already with several hours of content. I plan to release a total of 9 to 10 alphas before the finished release.*
  
  
*Oblivion Gate test*
  
[﻿](https://youtu.be/1iSHwYh6_y0)*(First test made on testing cell with vanilla interior dungeon lightning, second test made on vanilla
  
dagon shrine with natural exterior world lightning. I was not happy with my first try (showcased on
  
the video of the first gate test I published time ago), so i came back and redone the oblivion gate
  
effects and sounds, and now i like them much more.)*
  
  
*Oblivion Gate test 2﻿*
  
  
*(Final test just to see how daedra exiting the gate would look like. No daedra will come from this gate, but*
  
*later on the mod they will come from others, while already in oblivion, specially when travelling between*
  
*realms and/or pocket realms. Check the previous testing to see the full working mechanics of the*
  
*Oblivion Gates on the mod.)*
  
  
*Mythic Dawn Archvicar lines*
  
  
*(He is the second main NPC of the mod, with Agent Ragna being the first and the central npc of the introdutory
  
quest "The Sigils of Oblivion". After finishing it, you start the main one, "The Herald of the Second Coming",
  
and is the Archivar who introduces you to the adventure. (he is using right now my 4k re-texture of Mythic
  
Dawn Robes, but in the finished version he will receive unique "Mythic Dawn Priest Robes", although
  
they will not be featured yet on the first open alpha testing release))*
  
  
  
*Interaction with Dagon at Azrak'ath Ruins*
  
  
*(First communication with Dagon in the end of the introdutory quest "The Sigils of Oblivion". After you
  
collect the sigil stone you travel to his shrine to enter the gate to the Deadlands. (video is a bit outdated,
  
on current state the eyes of dagon glow in fire when you approach and he starts talking))*
  
  
  
*Azrak'ath Ruins boss fight (end of act 1 of 30)*
  
  
*(Final boss of the Azrak'ath Ruins. These ruins are underground Daedric ruins on Nirn, more specifically on the Reach. Here
  
you complete Act 1 of the mod, and most of the remaining 29 acts take place in Oblivion, about 80% of them in the Deadlands.
  
In act 1 the introductory quest The Sigils of Oblivion occurs, where you collect the Sigil Stone that will be used to open the Oblivion
  
Gate that I showed in previous videos. When you enter the gate the main quest The Herald of the Second Coming will then begin.)*
  
  
*Azrak'ath Ruins Mythic Dawn ghosts in the end of act 1*
  
  
*(At the end of Act 1, still on Nirn, in an underground daedric ruin, after you finish the dungeon and acquire the
  
ritualistic Sigil Stone, several Mythic Dawn ghosts who were killed in this ruin during the Oblivion Crisis,
  
during an attack by Vigilants of Stendarr, appear to motivate you to go ahead and carry out Dagon's plans,
  
which start with the Dragonborn opening a portal to Oblivion.)*
