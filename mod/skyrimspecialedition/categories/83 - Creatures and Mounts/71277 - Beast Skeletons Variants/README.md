**Beast Skeletons Variants**Makes spawn skeletons with the meshes of the mod [Beast Skeletons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/517) by Prometheus using the script created by fadingsignal in the mod [Real Rabbits](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29223). Using [SPID](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869), this mod distributes a spell to the races SkeletonRace and RigidSkeletonRace, that apply one of the different meshes from Beast Skeletons. Human appearance has a greater probability, while Argonian and Khajiit has the lowest.
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
No compatible with mods that add new skeletons thought a new race, or uses another look for the skeletons, in that case, this mod will override it.
