# Saints and Seducers Bugs Around Skyrim (FLM)
- Author: TheShiningAbsol
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69170
Requires the Saints & Seducers Creation and[FormList Manipulator](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74037)\*!
  
*[right]﻿﻿﻿﻿\*Old versions that don't require FLM are also available[/right]*
  
Saints & Seducers adds two new butterfly variants - a green butterfly and a purple butterfly, as well as a torchbug variant - the Bliss Bug. However, they only have a select few spawn points set, and due to the way critter spawns are, you may end up seeing very few in any given playthrough, possibly not seeing certain ones at all. They also drop unique ingredients, so that can be a shame.
  
  
This mod allows them to spawn using the regular system, so they'll spawn anywhere other bugs do. The purple and green butterflies will only appear during the day, whereas the Bliss Bugs will only appear at night.
  
  
I highly recommend also using [TDG's Madness Around Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36568) as well as my other mod [Corrupted Spriggans Around Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67792) for even more Saints and Seducers integration. Given the Creation's story of the barriers between the Shivering Isles and Tamriel being weakened, it's quite fitting to see all of these new faces more integrated.
  
  
Because this uses [FormList Manipulator](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74037), there will be no conflicts with any other mods. An old version of the mod is available that don't use FLM, but this edits the vanilla critter spawn formlists, so you will need to patch if you have multiple mods that edit them.
  
  
Also check out [Soulbugs Around Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69260) and [Torchbugs Expanded](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/96012) for more FLM-added critters.
  
  
By default, it is compatible with (and also highly recommended to use alongside) [Butterflies Unchained](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29538) and [Butterflies Land True](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29434). An additional patch is available for users of Butterflies Unchained that will allow the green and purple butterflies to also display the improved behavior of that mod (such as how butterflies interact with plants, to minimize how often you see them sitting on air). This patch will work with both the FLM version as well as the old version.
  
  
Will work regardless of game version, so long as you own Saints & Seducers.
  
  
Enjoy, and let me know if there's any issues.
