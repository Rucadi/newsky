[/font][font=Times New Roman]*Full overhaul of the Vampire Falmers added by the Dawnguard DLC. Make this variant more unique, with vampiric mechanics and spells, textures now in 4k, in addition to a greater presence in the world and the use of 2 originally discarded variants.
  
  
Unfortunately, like much of the Dawnguard DLC content, the Falmer Vampires were carelessly and problematically made. This mod aims to remedy, as much as possible, several of these problems, remaining, of course, faithful to the original concept.*[/font][/left][left][/left][left][font=Times New Roman]

- The Feral Falmers, originally present only in Darkfall Grotto, a small cave in the Forgotten Vale, are now renamed as Vampire Falmers, as it is the same name they have in the frozen version of them inside the Inner Sanctum of Auriel's Chapel, in the Forgotten Vale as well, and because they are, obviously, Falmer infected with Vampirism; *(image above)*

- A version that was not used in the final release had wings sprouting from the back similar to the Vampire Lord, and with the body more covered in bloodstains. This version has now been reused and now appears as a stronger version of the normal Vampire Falmer, being named as Evolved Vampire Falmer; *(in the image above: normal Vampire Falmer on the left, Evolved Vampire Falmer on the right)*
  
  
- The models received textures in 4k, and normal maps in 2k. Some of the textures and normal maps were at a very low resolution of 128x128, so the difference is significant to the eyes;

- The already mentioned Frozen Vampire Falmers, present in the Inner Sanctum of Auriel's Chapel in the Forgotten Vale, also received textures in 4k; *(image above)*

- The frozen Falmer mage version called the Frozen Falmer Shaman has been renamed to Frozen Evolved Vampire Falmer, and uses a frozen version of the Falmer Vampire with wings model, and also this is a version discarded by the developers that did not came out in the final release, and has now been reused; *(image above)*
  
  
- All Vampire Falmer, frozen or otherwise, now have the correct keywords for "undead" and "vampire". The Frozen Vampire Falmers and Frozen Evolved Vampire Falmers had a 100% Ice Resistance, this has now been reduced to just 70%. The 25% extra weakness to fire has been retained;

- Non-frozen Falmer Vampires no longer drop a paraphernalia of items, since they are naked, now only dropping Vampire Dust and Falmer Ears. Frozen ones break into pieces, so they don't drop anything naturally. Additionally, the pieces they shatter into when destroyed are also now textured in 4k; *(image above)*
  
- All of them had their speed relatively increased and now have more freedom of movement in the environment (when not frozen of course). The lvls and stats were maintained in the frozen versions, leveling with the player, while the non-frozen lvl was changed from a static 9, to a leveling with the player, which goes from 6 to 25 in the case of Vampire Falmers, and from 9 to 35 in the case of the Evolved Vampire Falmers, thus resembling the level progression of the frozen versions;
  
  
- All Vampire Falmers now can use Vampiric Invisibility, and their claws can also absorb life, and in addition the Evolved versions use life drain spells too, which level according to the Falmer's level. Unfrozen versions are covered in a light mist of blood magic, and it is now possible to contract Vampirism from all Vampire Falmer types;
  
  
- They can no longer pick up items from the ground like they did in vanilla due to a planning flaw. So they now only attack with claws and/or blood magic;
  
  
- To expand their presence, a small colony has been added to Blackreach's abandoned "War Quarters" ruins. There the Falmer isolated their brethren who had succumbed to Vampirism and could no longer live in society, and they feed them with their servants. The entrance is guarded by a Falmer who carries a key, and it is not relevant to the mod itself, but serves to isolate an area of the ruin where another mod of mine adds a Dwarven Controlled Power-Suit, thus ensuring compatibility and consistency between my mods.
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
Possible Issues: The Falmer's AI for some reason doesn't work perfectly for unarmed attacks, even though they have animations for it, and even execute them as a last measure. When making the Falmer Vampires, the developers created a specific combat AI for them, modified from the normal Falmer, to force them to use the claws, but it wasn't perfect. Also, because they used the common Falmer settings, they kept chasing weapons around the scene to use. I tried to improve their combat AI a little, and removed the possibility of picking up items from the ground from the Vampire Falmers, but this means that due to the problems mentioned and the impossibility of forcing them to perform perfectly in unarmed combat, they sometimes tend to retreat from combat. If you chase them, they will attack you, but they might back off again. This however doesn't always happen, and especially when attacking in a group they tend to attack more and more often.
  
To try to solve this problem, I decided to give them the aforementioned vampiric invisibility abilities, so in case they decide to start the combat by retreating, you can consider this as an ambush attack strategy, since they will be invisible until the moment they attack you. You might also consider that retreating during combat demonstrates the troubled mind of these feral Falmer, who only wish to hide in their dark, quiet corners, away from invaders and the light.
  
A final note is that I noticed the problem more in the Frozen Evolved versions, which sometimes simply decide not to use the Drainlife spell assigned to them, nor even the claws, limiting themselves only to retreating from combat, but, they are very punctual bugs, that you may never experience. But, if you get them, now you have a knowledge of what it is all about, and the programming limitations that caused the situations.

So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
