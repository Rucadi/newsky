**OVERVIEW**
  
  
  
  
Gingerbread Atronachsadds a **new summonable holiday-themed creature** that is as effective in combat as it is delicious. You can find two of these atronachs **animated within your room in the College of Winterhold**, left with a gingerbread house, a basket of Gingerbread men and women to animate yourself, and a note by Conjuration Expert Phinis Gestor explaining the **usage of non-Daedra Atronachs (aka Golems) throughout Tamriel's history**, and urging aspiring conjurers joining the College to learn to use them for their own purposes.
  
  
Once you have picked up the basket of prepared Gingerbread Atronachs, you can use the **Animate Gingerbread Atronach spell** to channel your magicka into animating up to 8 of these soulless, smiling cookie golems for yourself!  Each Gingerbread Atronach will remain animated for one minute, after which they will return to your basket, ready to be animated again. Each time you cast the spell, you will have an equal chance of animating a male or female Gingerbread Atronach.
  
  
Gingerbread Atronachs **wield a candy cane in battle**!
  
  
The textures for the Gingerbread Atronachs, the gingerbread house static item, the basket, and the candy cane weapons are all upscaled to 2K from the originals (which were mostly 512kb-1K) and optimized in BC7 format for best file size and performance.  For models this small, 2K results in a **very high quality image**, equivalent to the quality you'd see with 4K textures for something larger.
  
  
**Interactions patch for** **[Redcap the Riekling](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73441) available on Redcap's mod page**
  
**LORE-FRIENDLINESS & COMPATIBILITY**
  
As the note left by Phinis Gestor explains, the term "Atronach" in The Elder Scrolls can refer to both the intelligent, elemental Daedra bound by conjurers to do battle for them, and also to what would otherwise be known as **Golems** - Artificially constructed and magically animated objects, which can be **made of any type of material**, mundane or magical, and **animated by mages to serve a specific task**.
  
  
Gingerbread Atronachs adds a gingerbread house as a static decoration in the player's room in the Hall of Attainment, and the basket and note from Phinis as lootable items, which may not play well with all mods that alter the layout of that cell significantly. There is a patch included for **Obscure's College of Winterhold** to move the items to a suitable position to work with that mod, but other College overhauls that change the layout of that room may result in items being placed strangely.
  
  
There is also a patch for USSEP which simply forwards the records USSEP touches in that cell, though it shouldn't cause problems without it, it is available for those who want it.  If you use the Obscure's College of Winterhold patch, you don't need the USSEP patch as it includes the same forwarded records.
  
  
**All files are .esl-flagged, will not take up a slot in your load order, and are compatible with all versions of Skyrim SE/AE**
