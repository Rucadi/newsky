**Description**
  
  
A while ago, when I was playing WoW Classic, doing quests in Winterspring, I had to kill a lot of Yetis. They were able to use a type of icy breath. Then it occured to me, how about I make Frost Trolls able to use Frost Breath in Skyrim?

As such, I made this mod. It took me a while to release it, but recently, I finally found it to be ready for release.
  
  
This mod makes Frost Trolls cast Frost Breath, when they do certain power attacks or when their combat target is out of reach for them.
  
  
**FAQ**
  
  
Q: Why did you make them even more awful? They were already a nightmare to begin with.
  
A: You must be new to my mods. I like additional challenge. In addition, people requested this to be made. If you don't like it, that's fine. Just move along quitely. You pick and choose your own mods. That's the beauty of modding. #YourGameYourWay
  
  
Q: ESPFE?
  
A: Yes.
  
  
Q: Does installing/updating/uninstalling on an existing save work?
  
A: As far as I know, it should. However, it's good practice to keep a backup save prior to doing this, just in case.
  
  
Q: Is this compatible with <insert mod>?
  
A: I don't know by heart. You might need to check yourself.
  
  
Q: Will you make a patch for <insert mod>?
  
A: Only if it's a mod I use myself or plan on using it, I have enough time and I actually like the idea. Otherwise, feel free to do it yourself. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: I have a suggestion to improve the mod. Can you do it?
  
A: Maybe, if I have time and I like the idea, I'll consider it.
  
  
Q: Will you port this to <insert platform>?
  
A: No, I myself only support the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If someone else wants to port it, feel free. (see permission) If you decide to port it, you yourself take full responsibility to offer support to said port. I will not provide no support for any ports by third parties.
  
  
Q: I use a ported version of this mod on <insert platform> and I have a problem. Can you help?
  
A: I don't provide any support for third party ports on other platforms than the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If you have issues, you should adress the person that ported it.
