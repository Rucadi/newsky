[/font]*[font=Times New Roman]"[/font]*[font=Times New Roman]*In ancient times, dating as far back as the Meretich Era, when not even the Blades had yet appeared, groups of honorable, strong, and proud men raised their weapons against the tyranny of the Dragons in Skyrim, when almost everyone else still saw them as powerful gods to be venerated. These heroic and anonymous men have no songs about their deeds, no graveyards, no legends, they mean nothing to the Norse people they gave their lives millennia ago to defend, against an enemy much more powerful than themselves. Scholars believe that these warriors were Nedes, or even ancient Bretons, but there is no definitive conclusion. Their equipment style do not exactly resemble that used by the proto-Nords and Nords of those times, despite having an above average height like them.
  
  
Despite being long dead, these heroes and the Dragons seem to have some sort of connection between their souls, and in modern times, with the Dragons reappearing from their hiding places, or even rising from their tombs, the souls, or fragments of them, of these ancient fallen warriors are returning to their bones to fulfill their duty again: to slay the Dragons and destroy their powerful servants, the Draugr and the Dragon Priests. It is unknown what level of sentience they maintain, but there is still some sort of purpose in their bones, as they seem to specifically attack directly the Dragon mounds and Norse ruins where the Dragons are located, or at least their former minions.
  
  
Many scholars believe that the event of these ancient skeletons returning may be caused by them being intentionally reanimated and programmed by someone or some group, with veiled actions aimed at preventing the return of the Dragons, rather than a simple curse of the soul lost in time. In any case, one thing is certain, the focus of these undead is simply the destruction of the Dragons and their followers, and they pursue this role in a ruthless and robotic way, abdicating their own sense of integrity.
  
  
Although their equipment appear rusty and broken, corroded by time, they are faster and more intelligent in combat than most skeletons animated by regular means, in part because these ancient skeletons apparently have a soul, or fragments of it, in control of their bones, unlike most normal reanimated skeletons. In some ways, the undead state of the ancient skeletons is similar to that of the Draugr and just like the latter, the ancient skeletons appear to have thoughts and purposes, although apparently mechanically and/or obsessively directed towards a single mission, and even if limited, unlike common reanimated skeletons who are just mindless puppets, as mentioned previously.
  
  
Their rusty iron weapons, despite being worn and even damaged, seem to have a special effect on Dragons, which makes sense considering their past as professional Dragon slayers and possibly due to some kind of ancient magical enchantment*[/font][font=Times New Roman]*."*[/font][/left][left][font=Times New Roman]

So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
