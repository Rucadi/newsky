*Blood Horkers are a more predatory version of their mainland cousins, native to Solstheim's icy shores.
  
  
They use the fleshy proboscis that extends from their mouths for feeding: Small prey such as fish and crab are sucked up through the siphon-like proboscis and mauled by the horker's teeth. Larger prey, including the occasional Nord, are impaled by the horker's long tusks and drained of blood, earning the foul creature its name.*
  
  
**This mod adds a new creature: the Blood Horker.

**Why?**
  
The Blood Horker was designed to improve lore consistency between the TES5: Dragonborn DLC and the TES3: Bloodmoon DLC, as part of the Bloodmoon Creature Restoration Project.
  
Both DLCs are set on the island of Solstheim, yet many of the unique creatures seen in Bloodmoon have disappeared or been replaced by generic Skyrim creatures.
  
I aim to fix that!
  
(Also, it's December, maybe I just wanted to do Christmas colors.)
  
  
**Features**
  
-All horkers on Solstheim have been replaced with Blood Horkers.
  
-The unique horker on Horker Island has been given a unique skin.
  
-Other than the worldspace references and the one unique horker, no vanilla records have been edited, so this should be nearly universally compatible.
  
-Any changes to horker stats or behavior (by SkyTEST etc) will be inherited by my horkers for consistency.
  
  
  
This 25-sec teaser video isn't very informative, but at least you can see them animated! It's my first video ever so please don't trash on it too hard ;)
  
  
  
  
**Technical**
  
Install as usual (use a mod manager, or extract the files into your Data folder).
  
  
Requires Dragonborn DLC.
  
  
Load order: After any big creature mods such as SIC (though it probably won't matter).
  
  
No known conflicts; should be virtually universally compatible.
  
  
Safe to uninstall at any time.
  
  
  
  
**Design Decisions**Spoiler
  
I've designed this mod with the goal of recreating Bloodmoon's horkers with a close relationship to Skyrim's horkers, and with a model that blends seamlessly into TES5.
  
To this end, I've attempted to replicate the Bloodmoon horker's key features:
  
-A fleshy proboscis extending from the mouth, wrapped around the tusks
  
-Long, forward-pointing tusks
  
-A furry white coat with black rear fins and a black middle digit on the front fins
  
-Pointed digits on the front fins
  
-Black, beady eyes
  
I've also reshaped the horker's face to better accomodate the proboscis, decreased the size of the shoulder hump, and added pointed fangs in the creature's mouth (bloodmoon horker's teeth were not visible).

Q: What if they're both supposed to be the same creature, and the design just changed as graphics improved? 
  
A: The difference is canon: ["The Horkers in Skyrim more closely resemble a walrus than the seal-like bodies from Solstheim."](https://www.imperial-library.info/content/concept-art-book-lore-brief-review)
  
Q: But weren't they just called "Horker" in Bloodmoon?
  
A: Yes, and according to that same source as above, Nords just refer to all sea mammals as "horkers." I needed a way to distinguish them and "Blood" seemed appropriate.
  
Q: Aren't there bandits in Dragonborn who are called the Blood Horkers?
  
A: Yes, they got that name by being killed by the exact creatures in this mod, so I think it's fitting.
