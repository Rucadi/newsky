WITCHER HORSE EXPANSION

  
Witcher Horse Expansion is a complete horse overhaul that introduces the horses from The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt into the world of Skyrim. There is a vast new variety of horse coat colors, converted from The Witcher 3, Fera's Roach and Horse Overhaul, and Fera's Tribute Horses. Nearly all horses are now unique in appearance. Additional horses have been added into the horse encounter leveled list to dynamically add new horses to come across during gameplay. Horses that previously were not unique in appearance (such as Cicero's horse) will now have distinct coats. There are new named horses that can be found throughout Skyrim and Solstheim, some with regular coats and some with mythical appearances and magical effects.

[left]There are 20 unique horses with special effects and optional ENB light that can be found throughout Skyrim and Solstheim. They can be discovered in unique locations after finding and activating their summoning catalyst. The spell tomes to summon the unique horses have also been distributed in the merchant leveled lists with varying degrees of rarity and can be purchased from the Riverwood Trader or Phinis at the College of Winterhold. Alternatively, you can retrieve all the tomes from a chest in the QASmoke cell. The two unicorns can only be summoned unless you have the Wild Horses CC.[/left]

There are 21 horses with unique ESO inspired names that can found throughout Skyrim. They aren't strictly lore friendly but there were so many new horse coats to implement and I thought it would be fun to use some for ESO Easter eggs. 3 of the ESO horses are used as replacers for the Hearthfire horses.

[/font][font=Georgia]♞♘ Compatibility ♞♘
  
  

  
* [font=Georgia]Witcher Horse Expansion is natively compatible with both Special Edition and Anniversary Edition, as it uses the new mane partition system from AE. If you do still continue to have double mane, there is an optional file that applies a NULL texture to the vanilla mane, so that only the WHE mane shows.[/font]
[font=Georgia]Not compatible with mods that change the model or textures of horses[/font]
  
* New saddle meshes will need to be refitted to the new model, but retextures will work fine
Load Witcher Horse Expansion below any mods that add new horses.

This mod is very special to me as it was the first big project I undertook. I started knowing nothing and learned so much while creating it. This mod stands on the shoulders of the entire modding community and would not be possible without the incredible ingenuity of the various mod tool developers, the generosity of mod authors willing to share their work, or the many knowledgeable individuals who share their knowledge with others. Thank you![/font]
