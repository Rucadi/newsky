**[ [ [ MOD DESCRIPTION ] ] ]****If you're like me and have been disappointed with the vanilla Werwolves, then this mod is for you.  This mod replaces the vanilla Werewolf skeleton with a new custom skeleton meant to give the Werewolves of Skyrim a more proportional, realistic and intimidating****appearance. Working within the confines of the vanilla mesh, I enhanced the head and limbs as well as made other subtle changes to the Werewolves, and the result is a Man-Beast that will startle, terrify and immerse you even more into the world of Skyrim.**﻿**! ! ! SEEING IS BELIEVING ! ! !

**Should be fully compatible with any texture mods, since this mod contains no textures of it's own only a skeleton.  Which also makes it compatible with most other creature mods that do not edit vanilla skeletons.****[ [ [ INSTALLATION ] ] ]****Recommend using your favorite mod manager.****Install "Wicked Werewolves" after any mod that makes changes to the vanilla Werewolves and "Overwrite"  any files when prompted.
  
  
There is no "ESP" plugin with this mod!****[ [ [ SPECIAL THANKS ] ] ]****[size=5]**[/size]
