Replaces two of the generic assets used by the Carved Brink mod with custom assets.
  
  
The generic [Ebony Dragon Priest mask](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Nahkriin_(item))﻿ worn by the Stranger (and others) is replaced with a custom mask with a specific pattern:
  
SpoilerThe pattern on the mask is based on Dremora face tattoo. You find out that the Stranger is a Dremora Kynreeve at the end of the mod.
  
The generic [Imperial Corrupted Shades](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/File:SR-creature-Corrupted_Shade_(Imperial).jpg) with [Imperial Officer's Helmets](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/File:SR-icon-armor-ImperialOfficer%27sHelmet.png) are replaced with Snow Elf Corrupted Shades, which wear [Ancient Falmer Crown](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/File:SR-icon-armor-Ancient_Falmer_Crown.png)﻿ and use corrupted and darkened Elven weapons. I thought this makes sense as Facet Stones contains a fallen Snow Elf colony.
  
  
For the Corrupted Shades to appear with the new weapons, they need to re-spawn. Locations will generally re-spawn after 30 days. If they have not respawned, they will continue using the Elven and Ebony weapons they have previously spawned with.
