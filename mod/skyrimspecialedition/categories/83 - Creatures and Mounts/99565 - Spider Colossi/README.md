The spiders use re-proportioned vanilla models with high quality textures by [IconicDeath](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/34739755), and voices to fit their mythological sizes.

Their movement is heavier than regular spiders and their levels are in the 30s. Their combat prowess is similar to mammoths and they have a ton of health but not overly strong attacks.

They will try to avoid leaving their legs exposed, but with good movement you should get some hits in.[/font] The combat isn't very complex, these are really just mega oversized spiders with some tweaking.
