- Author: Various
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/88138
**~~~Main Features~~~**
  
**~ESP Tweaks:** The [fluffworks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56361) esp has been replaced by an ESL﻿ with some changes: horses have been removed; the white stag, painted cow, and armored troll have been added; and the bears and skeevers now use esp texture sets. All the other animals covered by fluffworks, that are not mentioned above, are mesh replacers and are not included in the esp. There are additional esp options available (in the optional files section) that remove bears and/or cows from the esp, for compatibility purposes. Please note that some patches from [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64445) will depend on fluffworks' horses, cows, and bears. So additional patching may be required for mods such as [Steeds of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120141)﻿, [Mihail's Cows](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/87958)﻿, or [Bears of the North](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47541), simply load these mods after mine (as well as any additional patches for these mods).﻿﻿
  
  
**~White Stag:** The white stag now comes in two flavors, reindeer or elk. Texture sets are used to recolor either the fluffworks reindeer or male elk mesh. Patches are available for vanilla, [belly](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70493)﻿[aches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68830)﻿, or [MM elk](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/94362)﻿, including textures for the male elk option.
  
  
**~Painted Cow:** The fluffworks cow mesh is assigned painted cow textures. Shell texture patches are available for vanilla, [belly](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70493)﻿[aches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68830)﻿, [MM real cows](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/94924)﻿, [MacDonald's highland cows](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29025)﻿, [YNSTBIH's better cows](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/15701)﻿, and [Northwind69's better cows](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13740/).﻿﻿
  
﻿﻿
  
**~Troll Expansion:** Armored trolls and uderfrykte are now fluffy, and optionally fat. Patches the frost troll and cave troll into their armored variants, plus they are now distinct rather than sharing the frost troll mesh. Optionally make any or all of the trolls rotund beasts. What started as a patch for corpulent trolls, has resulted into its own expanded set of well fed fluffy trolls.
  
OpusGlasses' [Udyrfrykte](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60734)﻿ has also been rehomed here as a replacer option.
  
  
**~Horse Tweaks:** Horses can be re-added back through a separate esl in the fomod; they are AE patched and use texture sets. The Imperial saddle has been refit, and the harness mesh has been added as well. There is an additional mesh option available that is less draft like in shape. This alternative horse option includes its own saddle meshes, and has several patches available. There are also optional patches for IWantATardis's beautiful saddle retexture mods ([Nordic](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42508)﻿, [Imperial](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42577)﻿, [Harness](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42514)﻿, [Shadowmere](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42594)﻿). Please note that if you want vanilla horses, you will need to also remove the horse.nif from fluffworks itself, horses have only been removed from the replacer esp.
  
  
**~Goat Options:** The domesticated or bell goat has been added, with an optional twist. Since the bell goat uses its own mesh by default, an option has been provided for it to use its own texture. Bellyaches three goat textures are selectable to be used exclusively by the bell goat. Also there are options available to make the wild and/or domesticated goat beardless.
  
  
**~Vale Animals:** Both the vale deer and vale sabrecat have been added. Two mesh options are available for the vale cat, the first with the vanilla shape and thinner proportions, the second with the thicker build like the base sabrecat. Vanilla textures patched only.
  
  
**~Trophys and Mounts:** All the Hearthfire BYOH trophies are now fluffy, with additional patches for addition trophies added by the [Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266)﻿ and [Cities of the North - Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40088)﻿. Most of the mounted animal heads have also been fluffed.
  
  
**~Final Addons:** Last up are options for the female elk to be antlerless (no edits to loot), and the arctic fox to have its vanilla shape. Both huskies are available as well, and have optional patches for Aenkill's [HD Husky](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36021)﻿ or Chilloucik's [Husk HD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/155115)﻿ textures.
