*"**Large, muscular humanoid daedras, with yellowish skin adorned with markings in red paint, the absence of a mouth, a pair of piercing yellow eyes, and red bony protuberances protruding from their heads, cheeks and backs. Rarely seen outside of Clavicus Vile's realm, these daedra are employed as guardians of important places by the Prince in his dominions.
  
  
They use heavy and adorned daedric armor, and heavy shields and maces, being creatures that resort to the use of brute force in their functions. Legend has it that they were also victims of Vile's unreliable personality, as despite their strong and intimidating appearances, they had thin, shrill and ridiculous voices. They then asked Vile to solve the problem, which he did by removing their mouths, an action he found hilarious. They can still speak with some effort, as they only had the outer part of their mouth removed, and covered by a layer of skin, but their voices became even more ridiculous this way, so that since then, unless ordered by Vile to do otherwise, they have remained as absolutely silent guardians. Some have been described trying to force a deeper tone of voice, but this too sounds artificial, especially when muffled by the extra layer of skin covering their mouths.
  
  
They are, as mentioned before, rarely seen summoned on Nirn or other realms of Oblivion, and are generally uninteresting, being just large and strong brute bodyguards.**"*

(\*Who is Beastmaster Mihail? He is my avatar/persona within the universe composed of all my mods. He is the ingame author who writes the texts that are usually presented as descriptions for my mods. A former monster hunter, now a dedicated scholar, he is planned to be released as an NPC in late 2022/early 2023, doing the same job in-game as my descriptions do on Nexus.)
  
  
  
**Technical Info -** only one Vile Guardian can be found, and it is in the service of Sebastian Lort, who serves or served Clavicus Vile in the past. He can be found protecting the wizard, inside Rimerock Burrow. By killing the daedra, it is possible to obtain the spelltome to summon a Vile Guardian.
  
  
**One last detail -** this creature is my reinterpretation of the little-known Guardian from The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard, from 1998 *(check the comparison bellow).*They appear quickly, in the quantity of 2, during a Vile's challenge. I decided to use the fact that they don't have mouths and that they have strange voices, one of which is even ridiculous, and that they serve a Prince known for being a prankster, to develop part of their lore above. ~~It is worth mentioning that UESP wrongly associates the Guardians with the Skaafin, without any logical justification. The only things they have in common are being yellow, humanoid and serving Vile. Other than that, they are creatures of completely different sizes and appearances, making it an unfounded association similar to placing Clannfears and Daedroths as the same race, just because they are both green, reptilian and serve Dagon. Guardians are in no way Skaafin, not even remotely similar to them. I hope that this erroneous association without justification or evidence is fixed at UESP, which is known for its quality content full of sources and great credibility.~~ UPDATE: The issue was adressed and corrected by UESP.

So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
