**OVERVIEW**

  

﻿

If you're like me, you've always felt that Skyrim's underwater areas were...extremely boring and lackluster.  Although there are some **atmospheric and interesting shipwrecks** and even a **ship graveyard in Pilgrim's Trench**, these areas are all...**empty.**  And worse, they are **devoid of danger or excitement**. 
  
  
**This mod aims to fix that by adding Anglerfish to shipwrecks and select underwater points of interest in both Skyrim and Solstheim.**
  
  
These Anglerfish are much larger than the baby versions of the creatures added by the Fishing creation in AE, **are actual enemies** that are dangerous to the player, and are a source of a few **new, unique alchemy ingredients.**  The orbs dangling in front of them **glow** and have a **shifting, waterflow pattern** if you manage to get close enough to get a good view of them, which adds a very atmospheric and creepy effect to seeing them lurking in the wreckage of sunken ships waiting for prey.
  
  
There are also two **unique Anglerfish** that can be found, including **Big Caesar**, a **gigantic world boss encounter** who **lurks in the depths of Lake Honrich** (Anglerfish in general are saltwater fish, Big Caesar is unique and has managed to adapt to a freshwater environment) and **Chow**, a **juvenile, friendly Anglerfish** that has been caught and now resides **inside the Riften Fishery.
  
  
Optional Anglerfish Addon for the Dead Man's Dread CC included with Skyrim Anniversary Edition available in Optional Files!**

  

**COMPATIBILITY & REQUIREMENTS**

  

**\*\*\*The Anglerfish will utilize whatever Lurker textures are present in your game including modded textures, allowing for very high quality appearance with no added file size!  In my screenshots I am using** **[Rustic Daedra](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19272)\*\*\*﻿**

  

No requirements, .esl-flagged and will not take up a slot in your load order.  Should be compatible with everything.
