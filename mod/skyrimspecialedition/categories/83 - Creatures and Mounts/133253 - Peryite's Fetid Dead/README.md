> Peryite's Pits have always been inaccessible to mortals. Our only real knowledge of them comes from reports of the other diabolical Princes. It is said that Peryite guards the lowest orders of Oblivion and that his summoners are to regard his likeness to Akatosh as some primordial and curious jest.

...And like their Lord of Blight resembles the form of Akatosh, the Fetid Skeleton resembles the remains of those mortally "blessed" by disease. Whether they take this form in cruel mockery, some sick admiration, or otherwise, these walking corpses serve Peryite and His faithful all the same.
  
  
These Daedra come in three variants, all of which can be encountered exclusively in Bthardamz. Whenever a puddle of Afflicted sludge is seen decorated with green, gorey bones, a Fetid Skeleton is sure to rise from its depths.
  
  
All tiers are armed with Dwarven scrap and gear, not unlike their Prince's own curious possession of the seemingly Dwarven Spellbreaker. All tiers also expel Afflicted vomit in combat. Don't ask where it comes from.
  
  
**The higher-tier Mage and Warrior variants can be conjured through their respective spells, found on a table in the Bthardamz Study.**
  
  
**Compatibility & Notes:**Safe to install mid-save, although preferably outside of any Bthardamz interiors.
  
I've tested this alongside [Ascension Of The Afflicted](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57005), and did not find any major conflicts between either mod.
  
Works well alongside [Undead Summons Emerge From The Ground](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33955)!
  
I don't know of any other mods that might affect Bthardamz, so please let me know if you use any or run into any issues :)﻿
