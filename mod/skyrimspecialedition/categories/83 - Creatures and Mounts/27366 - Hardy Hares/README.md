**[ [ [ MOD DESCRIPTION ] ] ]**
  
  
**If you're like me and have been disappointed with the vanilla hares, then this mod is for you. Skyrim's hares have the proportions of a stuffed animal****. This mod replaces the vanilla hare skeleton with a new custom skeleton meant to give the hares of Skyrim a more realistic and immersive appearance to more closely resemble actual hares.  Working within the confines of the vanilla mesh, I adjusted the head, neck, limbs and tail of Skyrim's hares to give them a hardier****appearance****!  These new subtle changes to Skyrim's hares have transformed them to more closely resemble actual hares that could survive the perils of Skyrim.  Now you can enjoy encountering realistic and hardy hares throughout the province of Skyrim, immersing you even more into the word of Skyrim with every encounter!****! ! ! SEEING IS BELIEVING ! ! !

Hardy Hares ! ! !****[ [ [ MOD COMPATIBILITY ] ] ]****Hardy Hares uses a custom skeleton for the Vanilla hares and will overwrite any mod that makes changes to the vanilla Hare skeleton.  Mods that make sweeping changes to vanilla skeletons e.g."Realistic Ragdoll and Force"****should be compatible as long as "Hardy Hares" is installed after those mods and allowed to overwrite their files.**
  
  
**Should be fully compatible with any texture mods, since this mod contains no textures of it's own only a skeleton.  Which also makes it compatible with most other creature mods that do not edit vanilla skeletons.**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
**[ [ [ INSTALLATION ] ] ]****Recommend using Vortex or your favorite mod manager.****Install "Hardy Hares" after any mod that makes changes to the vanilla Hares and click "Yes to all" when prompted to overwrite any files.
  
  
 There is no ".esp plugin" with this mod.****[ [ [ MY OTHER MODS ] ] ]****If you like this mod then I'm sure you'll enjoy my other mods as well.
