*"*[/font][font=Times New Roman]*Chub Loons are plump, flightless, auk-like birds found along the icy coasts of High Rock and Skyrim, preferring glaciated areas rather than sandy beaches. They are passive and will flee when approached. Once much more common on the northern coasts of Skyrim, they were hunted for their meat by the Nords, and only on the icy shores of Winterhold do a few flocks remain in the province.
  
  
A completely white version with blue beak and feet, known as the Atmoran Chub Loon, can be found north of Solstheim, and appears to be the only place in Tamriel where they can be seen. Some believe they were brought over on the Atmoran ships, as they were a delicious source of food and popular pets amongs the ancient Nords' children. Others believe they crossed the sea that connects the two continents by themselves, at a time when this was more easily possible, a feat shared with many other creatures from the frozen continent.
  
  
Several scholars even believe that all the Chub Loons originated in Atmora, and, according to Nord myth, the white Atmoran Chub Loons used to be much larger. They were said to be as big as two warriors, and with a squawk that could start avalanches, and to have even stood up to Ysgramor himself. This, however, is a silly legend, a nonsense told to amuse naive children and make drunken warriors laugh around the campfire.*[/font][font=Times New Roman][font=Times New Roman]*"*

[font=Times New Roman]So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.
  
[/font][font=Times New Roman](OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)[/font]

[font=Times New Roman]The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.[/font]
