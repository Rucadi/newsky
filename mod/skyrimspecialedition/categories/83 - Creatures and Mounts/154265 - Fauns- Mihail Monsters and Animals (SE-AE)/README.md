*Faun Morgrath Wildhorn Boss Fight 
  
(note that common Fauns do not have all the abilities of this boss, namely summoning
  
an Indrik Spirit, however all other abilities are present for them equally)

"**The Faun is no simple beast. He is a relic of a time when Tamriel was wilder and the lines between man and nature had not yet been drawn. With the legs of a stag, the body of a man, and the eyes of something older than either, the Faun walks the woods not as prey or predator, but as judge.**Where Spriggans protect the land, Fauns interpret it. They are philosophers of the Green, musicians of the wild, and when wronged, executioners without mercy. One old Druid told me the Fauns serve as arbiters of balance—punishing those who harm the forest, yet sparing those who approach with reverence.**But those days have passed. In mainland Tamriel, Fauns have become a rare and elusive presence, perhaps a reflection of a world growing colder to magic with each passing era. Their songs are seldom heard now beyond the deepest shadows of the old woods, where few dare tread and fewer still return.**Yet they are not gone.**Across the Systres Archipelago, Fauns remain a thriving and stable population, especially on the verdant isle of Galen. It is from these sacred groves that most Fauns are believed to be summoned by the druids, their songs carrying the raw will of nature through ritual and rite. In those isles, they are not myth—but kin.**Still, scattered accounts suggest that small, reclusive clans—or even solitary survivors—may yet dwell in hidden clearings, or in caverns deep within Tamriel's last untouched forests. These beings, if they do exist, live far from men and mer alike, guarding pockets of ancient power left behind by a waning age.**Fauns walk upright, like men, but bear the hooved legs of forest beasts and the twisted horns of old gods. Their most disarming trait, however, is not their form—but their music. Many who vanish in the deep woods report first hearing a flute's eerie melody, drifting on still air. That instrument, often carved from bone or elderwood, is not mere ornament—it is a tool of magic, and perhaps even judgment.**Among the Druids, the Faun is considered a sacred being. Not divine, but ancient and dangerous. Shamans speak of them as emissaries of the Green, sent to restore balance when mortals break it. They are not purely benevolent. Some are drawn to chaos, others act as keepers of primal law, and some... simply play. But their play is not for our amusement. It is for the forest, the rivers, the stone. They dance in glades men do not find twice, they whisper to bears, they charm vines to entangle trespassers.
  
  
They are particularly difficult opponents to face, summoning the very roots of the earth to their advantage, conjuring beasts, manipulating nature's magic to create bombs of natural toxins, controlling electricity and winds, and even mastering teleportation. To be honest, the academic consensus is that they do not exactly teleport; they open portals between the material world and the realm of the earthbones, becoming imperceptible to the eye, and also partially intangible at this stage. While traveling between dimensions, only especially lethal attacks can stop a Faun. To the untrained eye, such interplanar travel resembles teleportation, however. They are also capable of using this ability to channel spirits from this ancient natural realm, such as powerful Indriks' souls, temporarily switching places with them in combat."*﻿by Beastmaster Mihail \*
  
(\*Who is Beastmaster Mihail? He is my avatar/persona within the universe composed of all my mods. He is the ingame author who writes the texts that are usually presented as descriptions for my mods. A former monster hunter, now a dedicated scholar, he is planned to be released as an NPC in late 2022/early 2023, doing the same job in-game as my descriptions do on Nexus.)
  
  
  
TECHNICAL INFO: ﻿most Fauns can be found being summoned by hostile Druids that you may encounter in the forests. However, one particularly powerful Faun, larger and with even more impressive magical abilities, Morgrath Wildhorn, dwells in a remote cave in the snowy forests of Haafingar, harboring a deep grudge against the races of Mer and Men.

So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
