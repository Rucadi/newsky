I've worked hard for years to offer you the best of me for free, and the only thing I ask in return is this gesture, which increases my relevance and engagement on Nexus, and motivates me to continue;[/font]*

*"Seagulls are medium-sized seabirds with shrill calls and webbed feet. Seagulls are carnivores, hunting mainly on fish, squid and crustaceans, but they also opportunistically scavenge cities and boats. They usually live in groups on docks and around ships and shipwrecks, taking advantage of the human presence to steal and feed on their leftovers."*

(\*Who is Beastmaster Mihail? He is my avatar/persona within the universe composed of all my mods. He is the ingame author who writes the texts that are usually presented as descriptions for my mods. A former monster hunter, now a dedicated scholar, he is planned to be released as an NPC in late 2022/early 2023, doing the same job in-game as my descriptions do on Nexus.)
  
  
  
  
**Technical info:**This mod adds Seagulls in two separated ways: 1- The npc Seagulls that walk on the ground and roofs. They can be killed and have their feathers looted and used for alchemy.  2- The other Seagulls are animated objects, which move part of the bodies (heads and necks), and are positioned on top of buildings, poles and rocks.
  
  
Since it is impossible (except rare cases) to place npcs on top of trees, roofs, on top of ruins or on statues, the "animated object seagulls" were absolutely necessary. Also for several reasons of applicability, "animated object seagulls" cannot be killed or interacted.

So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
