**Description**
  
  
In the [Pets of Skyrim](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Pets_of_Skyrim) Creation Club Creation, there's a spider pet called [Arachnia](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Arachnia), which can be asked to spin a web trap. If any enemy steps on the trap, they will be paralysed for a few seconds.
  
  
I liked this and I wanted to apply this to all spiders and as such I made this mod.
  
  
Whenever a spider uses their spit attack, a web will be created at the end of impact of the spit.
  
  
When the player or an NPC walks into the trap, they will be paralyzed for 5 seconds, become weaker to fire damage for 5 seconds.
  
After the paralyze effect has ended, the player or NPC will be immune to the effect for another 5 seconds.

**FAQ**
  
  
Q: ESPFE?
  
A: Yes.
  
  
Q: Does installing/updating/uninstalling on an existing save work?
  
A: As far as I know, it should. However, it's good practice to keep a backup save prior to doing this, just in case.
  
  
Q: Is this compatible with <insert mod>?
  
A: I don't know by heart. You might need to check yourself.
  
  
Q: Will you make a patch for <insert mod>?
  
A: Only if it's a mod I use myself or plan on using, I have enough time and I actually like the idea. Otherwise, feel free to do it yourself. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: I have a suggestion to improve the mod. Can you do it?
  
A: Maybe, if I have time and I like the idea, I'll consider it.
  
  
Q: Will you port this to <insert platform>?
  
A: No, I myself only support the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If someone else wants to port it, feel free. (see permission) If you decide to port it, you yourself take full responsibility to offer support to said port. I will not provide no support for any ports by third parties.
  
  
Q: I use a ported version of this mod on <insert platform> and I have a problem. Can you help?
  
A: I don't provide any support for third party ports on other platforms than the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If you have issues, you should adress the person that ported it.
  
  
Q: Does this work on Skyrim 1.6+, aka "Anniversary Edition"?
  
A: Yes, it should.
  
  
Q: Why don't your mods use MCMs and instead use this janky console command system to set globals?
  
A: I am not a fan of MCMs. You can set the globals by making a patch in xEdit. I have no plans of changing this. If you want to add an MCM, feel free. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: Why don't you use FOMODs?
  
A: That would require reuploading the entire mod, in question, even if I only make a small change. My internet is limited and reuploading the files each time will take a huge chunk of my monthly volume.
