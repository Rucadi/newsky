![](https://i.imgur.com/PwJxVUw.png)*High quality vanilla Rabbit replacer, featuring a new detailed model and 4k textures. Hunting will now become much more immersive, with rodents that fit Skyrim's current graphics standards.

﻿**﻿**This mod offers a new highly detailed model, 4k texture and 2k normal maps for Skyrim's vanilla Rabbits, originally released in a low quality model and using textures and normal maps with a very low resolution of 256 x 256, making the Rabbits ugly, dated and blurry (as seen in the comparative images in this description). Due to the poor quality of the model, a detailed re-texture of it was never possible, so I decided not only to bring a new texture, but also to make a completely new model, adapted to the current Skyrim modding standards.*
  
  
[/font][/left][left][/left][left][font=Times New Roman]*﻿This mod not only stays true to the original concept, but makes the Rabbits's appearance even better embedded in the overall Skyrim setting. The mod is completely .esp free, so just install the model and texture, and finally enjoy a high quality rodent in your game.

- High quality new detailed model, 4k texture and 2k normal map replacer for vanilla Rabbits, 
  
a creature originally with textures with low resolution of 256 x 256 and a very lowpoly model;
  
  
OBS- The skeleton/animations of the vanilla rabbits aren't exactly very polished, so although this new rabbit's animation is a bit improved in the way the skeleton's bone weights are distributed throughout the model, it also has some of the same issues as the original vanilla model's animations, with some small deformation at the level of the limbs during some poses, but much less than the vanilla rabbit, and far from being a problem, being a great improvement in relation to the original model.

The mod is not compatible with other mods that modify the textures or model of vanilla Rabbits. If you have one installed, or think you might have one, put this mod below it/them in your load order. If you are asked about files overwriting those of other mods, press "Yes to all".
  
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.

[/font][/left][font=Times New Roman]![](https://i.imgur.com/bFFhLJ6.png)*Update on Deadlands development:**unfortunately I will be postponing the release of the Project Deadlands first open alpha test to late January 2023. It was initially planned for late September 2022, and later postponed to mid-October of the same year, but circumstances have been delaying me, so instead of delaying it again by another month when October ends, and then by one more at the end of November, I prefer to put a more realistic date already. Unfortunately I have been facing personal, financial and mainly family problems (which end up becoming financial too) that prevent me from being able to dedicate full time to the project at this moment, so I will focus on these remaining 3 months of the year on faster and smaller jobs, so I will continue to be active, and I will not stop producing content, and then on January 1st, with everything more stabilized in my life, I will be able to dedicate myself fully to the project. As I've shared it several times, mainly on my server, I'm not only investing time and effort, but the project also costs money, and right now I can't afford it, nor can I dedicate full time to it. I work practically alone, I do almost everything myself, and it's not feasible for me to continue developing the project this year. Thank you for understanding, and unfortunately unforeseen events arise, and a sequence of them occurred to me in the second half of the year, so I need this end of year to balance things out first. You can check more info about the mod bellow.*-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
*New quest mod coming soon:**The mod's first open alpha test release was initially planned for late September/2022 but was pushed back to end of January/2023 for better polish. The several hours long adventure takes place mostly in Oblivion, specially on the Deadlands, and is intended for the Champion of Mehrunes Dagon, however, several of the objectives include interaction with other realms and daedra, even in places outside of Oblivion itself: you will travel between dungeons, open areas, underground caves, towns, gigantic daedric towers, and much more.
  
In January/23 I will relese the first open alpha for community testing and bug finding, also as a show of respect to the users, since the project will take a full year yet to be completed, and i want people to know that the project is being developed, and also providing them a place to have fun while waiting, and at same time this will help me with bug finding, and with ideas for improvment. Quest has 30 acts, each new alpha will feature 3 new acts. Open Alpha Test 1 will feature only the first 3 acts, but already with several hours of content. I plan to release a total of 9 to 10 alphas before the finished release.*
  
  
*Oblivion Gate test*
  
[﻿](https://youtu.be/1iSHwYh6_y0)*(First test made on testing cell with vanilla interior dungeon lightning, second test made on vanilla
  
dagon shrine with natural exterior world lightning. I was not happy with my first try (showcased on
  
the video of the first gate test I published time ago), so i came back and redone the oblivion gate
  
effects and sounds, and now i like them much more.)*
  
  
*Oblivion Gate test 2﻿*
  
  
*(Final test just to see how daedra exiting the gate would look like. No daedra will come from this gate, but*
  
*later on the mod they will come from others, while already in oblivion, specially when travelling between*
  
*realms and/or pocket realms. Check the previous testing to see the full working mechanics of the*
  
*Oblivion Gates on the mod.)*
  
  
*Mythic Dawn Archvicar lines*
  
  
*(He is the second main NPC of the mod, with Agent Ragna being the first and the central npc of the introdutory
  
quest "The Sigils of Oblivion". After finishing it, you start the main one, "The Herald of the Second Coming",
  
and is the Archivar who introduces you to the adventure. (he is using right now my 4k re-texture of Mythic
  
Dawn Robes, but in the finished version he will receive unique "Mythic Dawn Priest Robes", although
  
they will not be featured yet on the first open alpha testing release))*
  
  
  
*Interaction with Dagon at Azrak'ath Ruins*
  
  
*(First communication with Dagon in the end of the introdutory quest "The Sigils of Oblivion". After you
  
collect the sigil stone you travel to his shrine to enter the gate to the Deadlands. (video is a bit outdated,
  
on current state the eyes of dagon glow in fire when you approach and he starts talking))*
  
  
  
*Azrak'ath Ruins boss fight (end of act 1 of 30)*
  
  
*(Final boss of the Azrak'ath Ruins. These ruins are underground Daedric ruins on Nirn, more specifically on the Reach. Here
  
you complete Act 1 of the mod, and most of the remaining 29 acts take place in Oblivion, about 80% of them in the Deadlands.
  
In act 1 the introductory quest The Sigils of Oblivion occurs, where you collect the Sigil Stone that will be used to open the Oblivion
  
Gate that I showed in previous videos. When you enter the gate the main quest The Herald of the Second Coming will then begin.)*
  
  
*Azrak'ath Ruins Mythic Dawn ghosts in the end of act 1*
  
  
*(At the end of Act 1, still on Nirn, in an underground daedric ruin, after you finish the dungeon and acquire the
  
ritualistic Sigil Stone, several Mythic Dawn ghosts who were killed in this ruin during the Oblivion Crisis,
  
during an attack by Vigilants of Stendarr, appear to motivate you to go ahead and carry out Dagon's plans,
  
which start with the Dragonborn opening a portal to Oblivion.)*
