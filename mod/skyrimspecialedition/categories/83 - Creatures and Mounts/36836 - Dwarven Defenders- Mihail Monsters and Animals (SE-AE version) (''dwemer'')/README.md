[/font][left][font=Times New Roman]![](https://i.imgur.com/PwJxVUw.png)﻿[/font][/left][left][font=Times New Roman]*''Created to be the pawns on the front line of the Dwemer army, Dwarven Defenders are articulated automatons designed to emulate the combat skills of their creators in wars and conflicts. Wielding light dwarven shields, and sledgehammers, and firing blasts of electricity through their central chest core, these machine armies are a force to be feared. 
  
  
They were commonly commanded by a Dwarven Centurion, who led battalions of 100 Dwarven Defenders, from where the "Centurion" name of these larger machines originated. With the disappearance of the Dwemer, and the end of the wars, most of the Dwarven Defenders were either destroyed by the Falmers, or assigned to patrolling and protecting the ruins, while others were probably simply re-modeled and re-assigned to other functions.
  
  
Their design and construction is so adaptable and complex that it was in them that Sotha Sil sought the basis to build his even more impressive Factotums, or at least a good part of them. Initially Sil started creating Refabricants, Dwarven Automatons refurbished following the mechanical methods of Sotha Sil and his designs, with the refabricant The Precursor being the first one of those creations. These Refabricants were even more complex than the original Dwarven Automatons, and already had a certain autonomous artificial intelligence, unlike the non-creative programming of the robots of the Dwemer. As mentioned before, most of those Refabricants were based on Dwarven Defenders, including the Percursor, or similar humanoid Dwarven Automatons.
  
  
Over time, Sotha Sil's work has evolved, with the emergence of the superior Factotums, with artificial intelligence, vocal articulation capacity, among many other improvements, with Refabricants being delegated to lower positions within the Clockwork City function hierarchy. It is important, however, to distinguish Refabricants from Fabricants, because as the name implies, Refabricants are machines manufactured by Dwemer, and re-manufactured by Sotha Sil and his followers, while Fabricants are biological creatures that were modified in Clockwork City to fabricate cyborgs.
  
  
Much of the superiority of the Factotums happens due to the fact that, while Dwemer Automatons are constructs created using tonal architecture, and animated by soul energy imbued in them using the mentioned tonal methods, this soul energy is used only as a battery for the robot, in addition to steam energy, among other resources, thus limiting automatons to a simple mobile machine capable of exercising pre-established functions, while in the other hand, Factotums are a complex fusion of metal and soul, made by methods even more incomprehensible than those of the Dwemer, but which allows them more complexity and a more interactive, progressive and intelligent programming, although, in a certain way still artificial and also limited to the specific function of each machine inside the City. It is known that Sotha Sil did not resort to Tonal Architecture to create his own machine armies, a method that extracts portions of the world's energy by manipulating the structures of reality on a temporary basis, therefore, needing recharging, as in the case of the legendary Shouts too, a nord type of Tonal Architecture, but he aligned his City and his creations with Nirn's own flow of energy and reality, adjusting their gears in the rhythm of the very gears of existence, where the term "Clockwork City" originated. Being in the flow of the actual energy stream of reality, their creations are continually being fed by the very energy of everything that exists, and closer to the naturalness of what it is to be a living being, unlike the disconcerting Dwarven machines without any trace of identity, reasoning ability or capacity of self-progression. Clockwork City's own gears, and on a small scale the gears within each Factotum, Refabricant or Fabricant, are its own cause and effect as a source of power and energy, with also apparently electricity being noted as part of it, due to Nirn's own electromagnetic nature.''*

So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
