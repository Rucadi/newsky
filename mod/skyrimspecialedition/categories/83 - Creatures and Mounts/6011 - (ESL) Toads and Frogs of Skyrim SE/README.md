**WILD** 
  
  
Wild Toads and Wild Frogs with Sounds of ambience are located near the Deadwood Lumber Mill of Falkreath  (along the river) + near  Riverwood + near Whiterun + near the Western Watchtower of Whiterun (near the Small House of my mod [The World Tree of Skyrim SE](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2422/?)) + around the Lake LLinalta (near Riverwood) + around the Lake Geir (near Ivarstead) + around the Lake Honrich (near Riften), also near Markath (the river of the Markath stables), near and in Morthal and the South of Solitude (near the boats on the other shore)
  
  
  
  
**HORDES**  ***Repopulate Skyrim with Toads or Frogs !*** 
  
  
This mod adds the ability to quickly incubate eggs of Toads/Frogs with the fire of the forge, and quickly create a horde of Toads or Frogs (5, 15, 50, 100 ...MORE ?...ATTENTION with the freezes in your computer !)
  
  
To obtain these Toads/Frogs eggs, simply bring any “Toad/Frog Egg ” (found with some Merchants in Falkreath : ***Volga Vinicia of the Dead Man's Drink, Solaf of the Gray Pine Goods, Zaria of the Grave Concoctions***) to a forge and create the "Incubated Toad/Frog Egg" in the "misc" section. Now open up your inventory, navigate to "Scrolls" and there they are. You throw them and when they hit the ground they hatch into Toad or Frog.
  
  
When your creatures die, remember to loot their corpses for more eggs
  
  
  
  
 **INSTALLATION** 
  
  
If you have my other mods with Incubated eggs, you must choose the mod for which you want to buy and place it at the bottom of the list when you launch the game.
