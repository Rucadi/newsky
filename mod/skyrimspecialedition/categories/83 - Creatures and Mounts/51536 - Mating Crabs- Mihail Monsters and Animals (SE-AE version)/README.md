*"During the mating season, both the small common Crab species native to Skyrim and the peculiar Horseshoe Crabs, native to the warm waters of Morrowind, flock in great reproductive frenzy around the sea coast, serving as a feast for predators, while they copulate tirelessly. 
  
  
Skyrim's small common Crabs appear in blue and red variants, are absolutely harmless and can be a viable source of food. They have an amphibious lifestyle, living both on the sand and rocks of beaches and in the shallow sea. They can often be seen feeding on carcasses washed ashore.*[/font][font=Times New Roman]*Horseshoe Crabs are a little larger, but are also harmless and have an exotic blue colored blood, with incredible healing properties. Interestingly, their name does not correctly define them, since they are not crabs, but closer to spiders. They have a more aquatic lifestyle than common crabs, arriving at the coast only during the breeding season. Their blood is still largely ignored, with its medicinal properties unknown to most, which means its market value is not that high for now. Perhaps this is exactly what is saving them from being extinct as another victim of the terrible and deadly human greed."*[/font][left][/left][left][font=Times New Roman]**by Beastmaster Mihail \***

So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.[/font][/left][left][font=Times New Roman](OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
