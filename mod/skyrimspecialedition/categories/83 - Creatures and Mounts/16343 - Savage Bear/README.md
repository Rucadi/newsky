**This is my first mod and I'm open to any feedback or constructive criticism, but keep in mind that I have a full time career and I'm in college part time, so it maybe a while before I can respond to any questions or comments. Please be patient with any questions or concerns and I will respond as soon as I can.****Thank you so much for your support.**﻿

**[ [ [ MOD DESCRIPTION ] ] ]**
  
 **If you're like me and have been disappointed with the vanilla bears of Skyrim then this mod is for you. After comparing tons of pics, paintings and sculptures, of different bears, and working within the confines of the vanilla mesh, I softened most of the hard edges of the limbs, reduced the bulge of the belly fat and enlarged the front upper torso and back of the vanilla mesh, to give it a more realistic, ferocious and savage appearance. These are the savage bears I've always wanted to see in the game. 
  
  
Hope you like them as much as I do.****This mod replaces the unimpressive mesh (model) of the vanilla bears with a more realistic, grizzled and savage looking bear mesh. This replaces all vanilla bears in game. This version does not include any textures, just the mesh, so you can use vanilla or your favorite texture mod. All screen shots use my new mesh either with vanilla textures or with textures from the "Better Bears" mod by aviform (Legendary Edition).****Remember to hit the "TRACK" button for Updates!!!**

﻿****With Version 1.1 a new customized skeleton has been added to the model, greatly improving the overall proportions and movements of the vanilla bears, Giving them a more realistic appearance.  These changes  include the following, 
  
  
1) Increased head and neck size 
  
  
2) Increased limb size
  
 
  
3) Positioned limbs under the body for a more realistic stance
  
  
4) Adjusted hind legs to improve walking animations
  
  
These changes really bring the vanilla bears to the next level!**

Version 2.x has officially been released with a custom "Shell Effect" fuzzy mesh and textures which will require the**[**FusaFusa Project**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5514?tab=images&BH=0)﻿**by Vicn.**  **If you haven't seen his work I highly recommend it, it's a work of art. This mesh was created from a suggestion in one of my posts by a user, so I decided to take up the challenge and try to incorporate it into the "Savage Bear" mod. I think it looks pretty great.****Hope you like it as much as I do!**

**[ [ [ MOD COMPATIBILITY ] ] ]**
  
  
**Version 1.1**
  
  
**Savage Bear uses a customized skeleton and mesh for the vanilla bears, and will overwrite any mod that changes the same files. 
  
Mods that make sweeping changes to meshes or skeleton files, such as "Realistic Ragdoll and Force" should be compatible as long as****"Savage Bear" is installed after those mods and allowed to overwrite their files.**
  
**Should be fully compatible with any texture mods for vanilla bears.**
  
  
  
  
  
**(Shell Effect) Version 2.x
  
  
 Mods that make sweeping changes to meshes or skeleton files, such as "Realistic Ragdoll and Force" should be compatible as long as "Savage Bear" is installed after those mods and allowed to overwrite their files.
  
 Version 2.x  is a bear replacer for the [FusaFusa Project﻿](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5514?tab=description&BH=0)﻿mod by[Vicn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/3863233)﻿, which is required prior to downloading my mod.
  
Since I am not the mod author of FusaFusa I cannot say whether or not it is compatible with any other mod.
  
You will have to create your own bashed patch or a patch using TESVEdit for compatibly with other creature mods that conflict with the FusaFusa Project.

**[ [ [ RECOMMENDED TEXTURE MODS ] ] ]
