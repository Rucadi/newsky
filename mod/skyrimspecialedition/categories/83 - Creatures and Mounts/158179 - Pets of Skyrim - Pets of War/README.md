With this mod, most of the pets added by Pets of Skyrim will no longer ignore combat and they'll instead fight to protect both you and themselves like most followers do.
  
  
Hilda, Arachnia, Skritch, and Sweet Roll will simply fight like most members of their species do. They still have the Light Foot perk and are essential, but now they'll also level with the player with no level cap.
  
  
Thistle works a bit differently, as rabbits don't have any attack data in the game. Instead of fighting, she now provides you with a combat buff in the form of a new spell called Rabbit's Charm, which decreases both physical and magical damage you take by 25% as long as ~~she's nearby ("nearby" in this case meaning within 2000 units of the player, which is approximately 30 meters/90 feet).~~ she's following you.
  
  
**UPDATE 1.2:**
  
-The Bone Wolf, Nix-Hound, and Dwarven Armored Mudcrab from their respective CC mods are now also included.
  
-A new Thistle Attack Patch has been added to allow Thistle to fight like the other pets. Requires ﻿[Chickens and Rabbits Can Attack](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56613)﻿ by AndrealphusVIII.
  
-The download now comes in FOMOD installer form, allowing you to choose which patches you'd like to install.
  
  
**UPDATE 1.3:**-Added optional buffs for all pets. The buffs are received whenever the pets starts following you and are removed once you dismiss them.
  
  
**Hilda - Sure-Footed:** While your pet goat is in your company, any attempts to stagger you will fail 50% of the time.
  
**Arachnia - Toxic Striker:** While your pet spider is in your company, you deal 50% more damage to poisoned opponents.
  
**Skritch - Sneaky Rat:** Your Sneak, Pickpocket, and Lockpicking skills are increased by 25% while your pet skeever is in your company.
  
**Sweet Roll - Fox's Cunning:** While your pet fox is in your company, your Magicka regenerates 50% faster and you learn all magic skills 20% faster.
  
**Dwarven Armorer Mudcrab - Dwarven Knowledge:** Increases damage on Dwarven automatons by 25% while Dwarven Armored Mudcrab is in your company.
  
**Nix-Hound - Vvardenfell Scavenger:** While your Nix-Hound is in your company, you have a chance of finding rare ingredients [ie. items from Rare Curios] from Morrowind on any humanoid enemies you kill.
  
  
The Bone Wolf's [Bone Wolf's Revenge](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Bone_Wolf_(creature)#Bone_Wolf.27s_Revenge) ability wasn't changed, though there is an optional patch to remove it if you want.
  
  
**UPDATE 1.4:**
  
-The Elytra Nymphs from Saints and Seducers are now included. They already came with optional buffs you have to activate via dialogue so there are no separate buff/no buff versions of the patch for them.
  
-Increased all pets' carrying capacity by 100.
