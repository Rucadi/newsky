[/font][/left][font=Times New Roman]*"Talkative Hagravens" adds 12 new immersive lines of custom dialogue for these ghoulish and bloodthirsty witches, making your battles against them more epic, frightening and unique;(check the lines on the video above)*[/font][font=Times New Roman]*The lines are spoken during combat, as a form of taunt. All Hagravens, including the uniquely named ones and the Glenmoril Witches, use these new lines. The named Hagravens used in quests generally have vanilla conversation lines, so these new combat lines are inspired by the style of dialogue and also the tone of voice of these dialogues, being perfectly aligned with these to maintain immersion.*

This mod is compatible with almost all mods that affect Hagravens in some way, including those that add new sounds to them. The new lines of dialogue are directly attached to the Hagraven's race entrance, shared by all vanilla Hagravens, including named unique ones and Glenmoril Witches, therefore being the most sensible method possible for their application[/font][font=Times New Roman]. Also, creatures that share the vanilla Hagraven "voice type" (sounds suchs as the sounds produced when you hit or kill them) won't use the new lines just because they share the vanilla sound effects of the Hagravens. Besides that, no matter if the new creatures use Hagravens animations, attacks, idles, or whatever, they will not have the Hagravens' unique lines of dialogue. So you don't need to worry about incompatibilities.[/font][/left][left][font=Times New Roman]
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.

[u]Additional acknowledgments:﻿﻿[/u] [Jayserpa](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/5201727)﻿- implementation of a small timer on the lines, so that there is no chance of the same line being immediately repeated again right after being heard for the first time (although the chances were small, such a situation could occur in version 1), in addition to expanding the reproduction of some of the 12 lines for the beginning of aggressive/combat mode, so that at least one of the lines is said at the beginning of the fight (previously it took 10 to 20 seconds of combat for the first line to be spoken); generation of .lip files for the Hagravens' lines so that these now move their mouths when pronouncing the sentences in version 1.1; fusion in .fuz of the .lip and .wav files for a smaller format.[/font][/left][left][font=Times New Roman]
