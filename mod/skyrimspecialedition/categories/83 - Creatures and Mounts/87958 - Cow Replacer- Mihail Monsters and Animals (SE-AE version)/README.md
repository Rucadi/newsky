![](https://i.imgur.com/PwJxVUw.png)*High quality vanilla Cow replacer, featuring a new detailed model and 4k textures. Finally, your game's farms will have realistic cattle in line with the current quality standards of modded Skyrim.

﻿**﻿**This mod offers a new highly detailed model, 4k textures and 2k normal maps for Skyrim's vanilla Cows, originally released in a low quality model,**with terrible texture mapping and lots of seams in inappropriate places,**and using textures and normal maps with a very low resolution of 512 x 512, making the Cows ugly, dated and blurry (as seen in the comparative images in this description). Due to the poor quality of the model, a detailed re-texture of it was never possible, so I decided not only to bring a new texture, but also to make a completely new model, adapted to the current Skyrim modding standards, as mentioned before.*[/font][/left][left][font=Times New Roman]
  
[/font][/left][left][/left][left][font=Times New Roman]*﻿This mod not only stays true to the original concept, but makes the Cow's appearance even better embedded in the overall Skyrim setting. The mod is completely .esp free, so just install the model and textures, and finally enjoy a high quality bovine in your game.

- High quality new detailed model, 4k texture and 2k normal map replacer for vanilla Cows, 
  
a creature originally with textures with low resolution of 512 x 512 and a very bad model; *(image above)*

- The painted Cows that can be found in the game being taken as a peace offering to the Giants also gained new models and textures, in the same quality and resolution of the non-painted ones; *(image above)*

- The "cow trophy" was also replaced by the new model, making the bovine decoration
  
made possible by the Hearthfire DLC even more beautiful and realistic; *(image above)*

- The Souls of Cows in Soul Cairn naturally now also use the new models,
  
with the soul effect of Soul Cairn applied to them; *(image above)*

- The item "Cow Hide" received a re-texture in 4k consistent with the fur tone of the new Cows; *(image above)*
  
  
[/font][font=Times New Roman]- The loading screen sometimes displayed when traveling to Whiterun and surroundings showing a Cow, has also been replaced with a new one using the new models. *(I wasn't lucky enough for it to appear for me in time to take a screenshot, as it appears randomly and has a small chance of appearing, but it's working normally)*

The mod is not compatible with other mods that modify the textures or model of vanilla Cows. If you have one installed, or think you might have one, put this mod below it/them in your load order. If you are asked about files overwriting those of other mods, press "Yes to all".
  
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
