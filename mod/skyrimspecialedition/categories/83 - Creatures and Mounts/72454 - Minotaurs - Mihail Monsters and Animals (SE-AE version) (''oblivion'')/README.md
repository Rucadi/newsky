* *This mod is a compilation of all my Minotaurs mods. At the moment, it compiles in a single esp the mods: High Minotaurs **(**[LE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/81998)﻿) ([SE-AE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34392)﻿) and Cyrodilic Minotaurs **(**[LE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/88477)﻿) ([SE-AE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27364)﻿). If you use these two mods, by downloading this new file you will be able to delete these two esps, thus saving space in your load order;*
*Obviously you should not use this mod together with the two mentioned above, since they are already compiled in this new file, and using them at the same time will double the amount of Minotaurs in your game, in addition to other possible problems;*
  
* *I will be on vacation from August 1st to September 9th, 2022. No new releases or updates will be*
    
  *released**during this time period, but I will be available on my Discord server, albeit more sporadically;*
*If you use, like and value my work, please consider giving an endorsement. I've worked hard for years to offer you the best of me for free, and the only thing I ask in return is this gesture, which increases my relevance and engagement on Nexus, and motivates me to continue;*

*From High Minotaurs description page:*
  
  
*"These ferocious men-bull descendants of Morihaus are said to have symbolized the Alessian Empire during the 1st Era, but later became commonly seen just as dangerous beasts by the other races. This beastfolk has thick grey or brown skin and curved horns of different sizes. Some Minotaurs clothe themselves in a simple loincloth and wear nose-rings, others wear intricate leather or fur armor, while some even prefer to wear heavy metal armor pieces. They are most commonly found on Cyrodiil, Elsweyr, High Rock and Skyrim, and although no records survive to confirm their origins, some scholars claim that Minotaurs trace their lineage back to the relationship between Empress Alessia and the demi-god Morihaus. Their union gave birth to Belharza the Man-Bull, believed to be one of the first Minotaurs (if not the first), who ruled the Empire after the death of Alessia.
  
  
In the years during and after Empress Alessia's reign, Minotaurs began to appear in greater and greater numbers. During this time, some scholars believe the early Minotaurs possessed intelligence and culture comparable to other races of beaskfolk. Artwork and texts from the First Era suggest they were fiercely loyal to the Empire and were among Empress Alessia's most devoted defenders, but despite their devotion to the Empire, Minotaurs were always a target of suspicion and fear because of their size and strength, and with the rise of the fanatical Alessian Order, they were re-classified as "monsters", no better than Ogres or Trolls, and most were driven into the forests by the fanaticals, who destroyed whatever culture they previously possessed. Much of the evidence to support this claim was also destroyed in the intervening period while the Alessian Order ruled the Empire, but one remaining fragment of an ancient tablet depicts Alessian troops revolting against Emperor Belharza, giving some credence to the theory. Nonetheless, Minotaurs were not entirely wiped out by the Alessians and continued to roam the woods and hills of Cyrodiil throughout the following eras, while on the other mentioned provinces (far away from the center of the Empire) they remained considerably more in contact with the other races and with civilization itself for a longer period of time, but still often viewed as well with some suspicion by them. By the 3rd and 4th Eras their noble ancestry was all but forgotten by most races, except by some particular groups such as the Forsworn.
  
  
Unlike the ferocious Minotaurs that inhabit Cyrodiil, the Minotaurs that inhabit Skyrim, Elsweyr and part of those that inhabit High Rock, are among the variants closest to the original glory, power and appearance of their race. Relatively less muscular and with less endurance than the Cyrodilic Minotaurs, they are however considerably bigger, faster, much more intelligent, and their powerful armor and weapons make them more lethal enemies if a clash between both variants happens. They have gray skin, less body hair, slightly more humanized features, and considerably smaller curved horns. Also commonly solitary, and eventually engaging in fatal male combats between themselves, some however can be seen alongside Forsworns.
  
  
The Forsworns, given their renegade status, their adoration of the "Old Ways" and the "Old Gods", rescuing Tamriel's ancestral soul culture, ended up becoming a safe heaven for acceptance and oportunity to return to the "civilized" community lifestyle for several highly discriminated beast-races, which explains the presence of some Centaurs, Minotaurs and Satyrs, among other races, on their ranks. In addition, the deep connection of this faction to Hircine, the father of the man-beasts, is also an important factor, since many Minotaurs and Centaurs, among others, found the patron they sought in the Daedric Prince. Especially the powerful Minotaur Shamans are worshiped in almost equal footing to the Hagravens by the Forsworn, and treated with profound reverence, as direct descendants of the "Old Gods" and the heirs of their power.
  
  
It is important to note that Morihaus was known as Morihaus-Breath-of-Kyne, one of the "Old Gods" worshiped by the Forsworn, and patron of the forces of nature, although, of course, interpreted by the unique Forsworn philosophy and system of beliefs. Kyne is also particularly known as the goddess of storm, thunder, rain and wind, and it was she who gave mortal races the power to use Thu'um. It was not by coincidence that Morihaus, Belharza, and the ancient Minotaurs were known for their powerful shouts that caused towers to collapse, and deluges to fall from the sky, in addition to embedding their heavy hammers with lethal thunder enchantments. Apparently however, this ability seems to have been lost in current days.
  
  
In Skyrim, an explorer can find from common Minotaurs to the largest and most powerful Minotaur Lords. Both usually occur in the North, Northwest and Northeast regions of Skyrim, but some can also be found on the Reach. Minotaur Shamans generally live in Forsworn camps, and are incredible users of highly destructive fire magic. Minotaur Gladiators are probably the most powerful variant, and certainly the biggest, and are former veterans of arena combat. Unlike the gladiator minotaurs of cyrodiil, these minotaurs entered this life voluntarily, and take great pride in their proficiency on killing their opponents in the arenas across Tamriel. Unfortunately with the relations between Skyrim and the Empire getting colder, many of the cultural shows that used to be largely sponsored by the Imperials in the province are now scarce, and the Imperial tradition of gladiator arenas was one of them. Because of this, these veterans now live secluded lives, commonly in remote places, building their camps in small forts or abandoned ruins, which a prudent explorer should always avoid. These gladiators traditionally carry on their backs the weapons of the most honorable opponents they killed.
  
  
The especially gigantic ghost of a minotaur, a legitimate representative of the glory of his ancestral race, guards the end of Shalidor 'Maze, in the ruins of Labyrinthian, since the 1st Era. Known as The Maze Guardian, this powerful minotaur was once a friend and training partner of the then Archmage Shalidor, and pledged to keep his friend's secrets after his departure. Legend has it that he was also an important part of the mighty wizard's trials. This minotaur honors his demi-god ancestry, being able to use his powerful Thum'um to manipulate the wind and create storms, casting powerful cyclones and embedding his hammer with the most powerful power of the thunder."*by Beastmaster Mihail \*

The feral Cyrodilic forest dwellers are the most degenerate descendants of Morihaus and the now extinct minotaur civilization of the Alessian Empire. This variant has absolutely wild behavior and is physically bulkier than their cousins ​​that can be found in Skyrim, and other provinces of Tamriel. Despite their greater stamina, physical strength, and toughness, these forest Minotaurs are smaller in height, slower, and more poorly protected, as they wear little or no armor, compared to more civilized ones. They also have more fur, which is also thicker, and are more bestial in appearance, and have much larger pairs of horns.
  
  
As mentioned, all Minotaurs are likely descendants of the demigod Morihaus, who is depicted as a bull-man, and Belharza, the Minotaur Emperor, son of Alessia and Morihaus and second emperor of the First Cyrodilic Empire. Unlike their more civilized cousins, nearly every attempt at contact, cultural exchange, and peaceful coexistence with the Minotaurs of Cyrodiil ends in the death of someone, so little is known of their view about the events of Tamriel, the other sentient races, and even their own  origin. More civilized Minotaurs, or at least a portion of these, seem to look down on this feral variant, and even consider it a separate species, little more intelligent than a Troll. Some go even further, claiming a different origin for them, supposedly associated with Hircine. Where, however, the facts end and racism begins is difficult to define.
  
  
As this variant is native to Cyrodiil, people only see them commonly in Skyrim near the Cyrodilic border, both in Falkreath, Reach and the Rift. Though commonly solitary, some can band together into small gangs, usually with a Cyrodilic Minotaur Lord as their leader. In Cyrodiil they were often captured and forced to fight in arenas, even facing their smarter and better equipped cousins, a battle in which they often lost, and paid with their lives. Unlike the Minotaurs from other provinces, who volunteered for the life and glory of a gladiator, the poor Minotaurs of Cyrodiil were victims of a cruel and sadistic game, fed by the Empire, to entertain their subjects with bread and circuses, so that they do not perceive the ills of the system that governs them."*

So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.
  
  
Obviously you should not use this mod together with the standalone versions of the mods that are already merged inside it, as they are already compiled in this new file and using them at the same time will double the amount of Minotaurs in your game, in addition to other possible problems.
  
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The standalone versions of Cyrodilic Minotaurs and High Minotaurs have a small issue: the Minotaurs' punches in occasional cases could cause you to be thrown at a considerable height in the air. It was always planned that some of their punches could knock you down, and even throw you some distance away, but never the distance that you sometimes ended up being thrown. It was a situation similar to the vanilla Giant attacks issue, but in this compilation it doesn't happen anymore.

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
