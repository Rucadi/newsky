[/font][/left][font=Times New Roman]***"Talkative Seekers"** adds 9 new immersive lines of custom dialogue (in the form of combat taunts) for these eldritch servants of Apocrypha, echoing their devotion to forbidden knowledge**as they guard their master's secrets. Each encounter becomes a descent into madness, obscurity, and the endless hunger for lore.

This mod is compatible with almost all mods that affect Seekers (including model replacers) in some way, including those that add new sounds to them. The new lines of dialogue are directly attached to the Seeker's race entrance, shared by all vanilla Seekers, [/font][font=Times New Roman]therefore being the most sensible method possible for their application. Also, creatures that share the vanilla Seeker "voice type" (sounds suchs as the sounds produced when you hit or kill them) won't use the new lines just because they share the vanilla sound effects of the Seekers. Besides that, no matter if the new creatures use Seeker's animations, attacks, idles, or whatever, they will not have the Seeker's unique lines of dialogue. So, you don't need to worry about incompatibilities.[/font][/left][left][font=Times New Roman]
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
