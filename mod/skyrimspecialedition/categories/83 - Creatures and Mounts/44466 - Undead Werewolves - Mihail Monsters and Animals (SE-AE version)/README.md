*"**Most undead werewolves have had their bodies resurrected and their souls forcibly bound to them again by dark wizards such as the Hagraven, using dark magic to make the beasts loyal servants. Unable to enter the promised afterlife, they are now doomed to wander the world as decaying werewolf corpses rather than traveling to the Hunting Grounds, until someone manages to destroy their decaying corpse prisons.*
  
[/font][/left][font=Times New Roman][/font][font=Times New Roman]*They live in fierce packs with the leadership of a large Alpha Undead Werewolf. Some can be found near Hagraven's lairs, dungeons related to Companions when they were once members of that guild, or also wandering around places when they were killed by Silver Hands or other beast slayers.*[/font][font=Times New Roman][/font][left][font=Times New Roman]*They are slower and weaker than normal werewolves because their rotten body, their staggering movement highlights the decay of their limbs, they no longer have a full coat of fur covering their bodies, just a few sparse hairs and putrid skin covered in scars and wounds, stained with rotten blood. Despite their condition, their claws are still sharp and carry debilitating diseases.**"*

A former monster hunter, now a dedicated scholar, he is planned to be released as an NPC in late 2022/early 2023, doing the same job in-game as my descriptions do on Nexus.)

- 1 new disease: Zombie Fever (in game description- "The contact
  
between the necrotic tissue of zombies and your bloodstream causes
  
a bacterial infection that impairs the regeneration of your stamina.").

So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Mihail Monsters and Animals series aims to create and make available to the community the most complete set of creatures for TES 5: Skyrim, implemented in an immersive and unique way, with respect to the pillars of lore. Instead of pathetically just throwing models and textures in the game reusing 100% vanilla mechanics, the creatures made by Mihail have uniqueness and extreme zeal in their idealization and implementation, which will provide you with an experience that you have never had before in this area.
