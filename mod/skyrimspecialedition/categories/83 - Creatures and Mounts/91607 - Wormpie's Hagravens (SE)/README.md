# Wormpie's Hagravens (SE)

***Description***
  
  
**An extensive variety.** This mod replaces all hagravens in the game with new lore-friendly variations, sometimes handpicked for specific cases like Moira and Melka, and sometimes picked at random across all the other 70+ variations.
  
  
With this mod, you might never run into two hagravens looking exactly the same in the span of a whole playthrough!
  
  
**Unique additions.** You can now meet*"that hussy Esmerelda, with the dark feathers"* that Moira talks about, or entirely new and unheard of hagravens like the "*Handmaiden of Vokun*" or the "*Woman in the Pines*". A number of new unique hagravens can be encountered throughout Skyrim, often with their own new lore, flavor, visuals and selection of spells.
  
  
**A continuous challenge.** All hagravens will now remain a challenge for slightly longer, as they will scale with you to level 50 and sometimes further. In addition, some hagravens will now use a slightly different selection of spells to keep it fresh.

***Notes***
  

  
* Other version include the non-SE version [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/115417)﻿ and the xbox version [here](https://mods.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/mod-detail/4346987).﻿
Oreo's "Madmen - A Forsworn Overhaul" handles the combat and scaling improvements a lot better than I have done, so I can recommend [their patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98579?tab=files)﻿﻿ that they have available to get the best of both worlds.
  
* If anyone wants to make improvements to this mod, please reach out to me, and we can make it happen. This is also relevant if you find any conflicts with other mods.
