Integrates [CFTO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8379) ferries with a few town overhauls to fit more naturally and seamlessly. Each patch is a separate plugin, so you can choose which ones you want to install. All plugins are ESL flagged.
  
  
[Better Tel Mithryn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/643)**:**
  
Moves the Tel Mithryn ferry to the new docks added by Better Tel Mithryn for easier access. Animated and static boat options available.
  
  
[The Great City of Dragon Bridge](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19962)**:**Moves the Dragon Bridge ferry from across the river to the new docks accessible via a trapdoor above. The boat used comes from TGC Dragon Bridge, so whether it's animated or not depends on if you use a [Realistic Boat Bobbing patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44311) or another mod that changes it to an animated boat. By default the boat is static. The patch can also be used with [The Great Cities - Minor Cities and Towns](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20272).
  
  
[The Great Town of Ivarstead](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34505)**:**
  
Moves the ferry to the new docks added across the river, on the other side of the bridge. Should not be used with JK's Skyrim, as it comes with a CFTO patch of its own, changing the location of the Ivarstead ferry.
  
  
[size=4]**Requirements:**
  
[Carriage and Ferry Travel Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8379)[Carriage and Ferry Travel Overhaul - Fixes and Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40651)
  
Any town overhauls you wish to install the patch for.
  
  
**Installation:**
  
Download with your mod manager, choose your preferred options in the FOMOD. The town overhauls should be detected automatically.
  
Persistent references were moved, so a new game may be required. On my test save the objects did move, YMMV.
