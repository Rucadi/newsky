# Animated Water Lily
- Author: skirymmods
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/75407


this mod is a mesh replacement.
  
it doesn't need a esp/esl file.
  
  
it expands the meshes from ztree's with animated parts.

please pardon me !
  
ashes on my head ...........
  
  
i found a silly bug in some meshes !
  
it led the Skyrim engine to mad moves of the meshes to positive/ negative z directions.
  
  
this update is a hot fix. you should update your installation, please.

second you download and install this mod.
  
you can install/uninstall at any time. because only meshes are replaced it doesn't do any harm to your game.

performance impact:
  
yes, there could be a fps loss. of course it depends on your cpu/gpu . i guess i noticed some impact but on your machine it could be different.
  
give it a try, to see if it's tolerable for you or not.
  
this mod will not do any harm to your game or saves (if nothing unusual happens .....)
  
  
as i said before: you can install/ uninstall this mod at any time, it's always save.
