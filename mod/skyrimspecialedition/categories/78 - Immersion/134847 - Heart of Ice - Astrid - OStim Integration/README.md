**What does this mod do?**
  
  
This adds OStim Standalone integration for the "Fadetoblack" scenes in original mod. There is an option file provided which lowers the cooldown of the dialogue option to 2 hours, originally used to debug but use if you wish. This mod does not add dialogue, voice acting, or anything not in original mod. It simple hooks into the existing scripts used to start scenes (except originals are just fade out scenes). 
  
  
Let me know if I missed anything, can be updated.
  
  
  
**Requirements**Original follower mod: **Heart of Ice - Astrid** and **OStim Standalone.** I am not sure if it works with previous versions of OStim, so you can try but I will not support issues with that version. Currently updated to 1.3.
