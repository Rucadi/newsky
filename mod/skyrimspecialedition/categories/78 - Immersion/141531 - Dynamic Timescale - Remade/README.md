# Dynamic Timescale - Remade

**[Description]**
  
Remade version of [Dynamic Timescale](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10594/). Welcome to 2025.
  
Can dynamically adjust the game's timescale depending on various conditions like location, combat and menus in use.
  
Can also save your game after combat ends and after picking a lock, supplementing the game's own autosaves.
  
Fully customizable through the mod's MCM, which saves and loads your settings automatically between savegames.
  
  
Why though: The main goal of this mod is to slow time down while doing active or high intensive things like combat, crafting, trading, talking. So not a whole day goes by because an npc talked a little longer. While at the same time being able to see the days go by as you travel across the world.
  
Pairs well with something like [Time Flies SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39426) for extra immersion!
  
  
  
**[Features]**
  

  
1. Adjusts game's timescale based on various conditions!
Built in workaround for the few known to stall scenes. (Riverwood and Solitude)
  
2. Can trigger additional autosaves after combat and after picking (or trying to pick) a lock!
Separates fast travelling from the timescale, so you can even adjust the time while looking on the map!
  
3. Allows adjusting fast travel time. Tying in with the above, let's you adjust fast travel independently of the actual timescale!
Highly customizable MCM, every feature can be toggled and adjusted, settings persist between savegames!
  
4. Clean scripts, only using very specific events for the features that were actually enabled!
Localisation Support!
  
5. Esl Flagged Plugin!

  
Supported Timescale Conditions:
  

  
* Location: Interior, Exterior, Wilderness plus an additional user defined list of added cells.
Combat: In and out of combat, combining with the locations for up to 8 different timescales.
  
* Menus: Dialogue and Crafting are natively unpaused and supported.
More Menus?: These menus are normally paused, so it's recommended but not required to use an unpauser like [Skyrim Souls](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27859) for these: Bartering, Reading, Containers, Inventory, Journal, Map, Lockpicking, Magic, Stats
  
  
Riverwood and Solitude:
  
Timescale will automatically be reverted to 20 the first time you arrive in Riverwood and Solitude. This is to make sure the NPC don't get stuck trying to return from the scripted scenes. On subsequent visits the timescale will behave as usual.

**[Questions]**Q: What's the difference to [Dynamic Timescale SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18922)?
  
A: Everything. That mod is a 1:1 port of the original LE mod. This is a completely remade mod.﻿ See above for features.
  
  
[size=3]Q: Can non default timescales cause issues?
  
A: A lot of confliction information. The general consensus seems to be that a timescale of 6 or higher is considered safe. I recommend using a timescale of 6 minimum for normal gameplay and 3 minimum during combat or in menus only. The sliders accept values from 2 to 120. 
  
If you encounter issues like NPC taking forever to arrive at their destination or being stuck at trying to use doors increase the timescale for the affected scenario.
  
  
Q: Aren't autosaves bad?
  
A: Also a lot of conflicting opinions on whether autosaves can corrupt your savegame and cause crashes. Autosaves have been a feature of the original mod and therefore have been implemented here aswell. I added delays for safety and they're disabled by default. I do not make any recommendation for or against using autosaves.
  
  
Q: Why is there a bunny again?
  
A: Meow.

**[Thanks]**[Kae Arby](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/KaeArby) for the original [Dynamic Timescale](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/10594/) mod. While this was made entirely from scratch, the idea originated from their version.
  
  
Enjoy! :3
