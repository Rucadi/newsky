An ongoing project with the goal of bringing Skyrim's Worldspace to a more updated level of detail with new locations, improved locations, and more interesting encounters, all while generally sticking to Bethesda's style of level design, and with performance and mod compatibility for the average player in mind.

 Ryn's Crabber's Shanty
  
  
[/font][font=Georgia]The lovely shack where our "poaching" friends "*The jarl can hardly eat every ~~deer~~ crab now... Can he?"*capture crabs and.. not much else.
  
Now with a little story to their trade, these fishermen stumbled across a trove of crustaceous **gold**.

Deep in the mountain lies a beast of legend. As old as time, some may say, the Titanclaw lurks beneath the surface, on the edge of death, waiting for a mortal foolish enough to revive it and bring its wrath upon The Reach. 
  
Search the mountainside for the entrance, fight your way through the cavern, and find the crab-obsessed Titanclaw Caller, before it's too late.

[/font][font=Georgia]A Special Thank you﻿
  
A very special friend of mine who encouraged me to start modding.
  
Those who have helped encourage me, helped with feedback, and supported my work, thank you.
  
Without you, I do not think this project would continue.
  
As always, I love you, and happy modding.
