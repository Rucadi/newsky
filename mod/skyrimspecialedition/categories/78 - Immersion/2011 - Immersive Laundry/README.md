SSE note: The updated .esp file and meshes available on this page were created/tested by [Rusey](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/1711848).
  
Please bear in mind that this is otherwise an exact copy of [the original Skyrim mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/58084), and has not accounted for any little changes to the landscape that may have occurred in SSE.
  
  
This mod adds a touch of the ordinary to the homesteads of Skyrim in the form of many clotheslines - and occasionally washboards, basins and scrub brushes. They are simple decorative objects, placed with care in almost every civilized area of the game, with an emphasis on making houses, cabins and occasionally forts feel a little more like home.
  
  
  
New in 1.0: REAL WATER!

(This is a very old version of the mod on display, but you'll get the gist of it.)

Status:
  
This mod is pretty much finished, polished, and no longer actively being updated.
  
  
`
  
  
Compatibility:
  
(Note: This is all pre-SSE!)
  
This requires only vanilla Skyrim and should be compatible with almost everything.
  
Script-free, close to zero performance impact, and thoroughly cleaned in TES5edit. 
  
  
**These mods I personally confirmed to be compatible:**
  
Expanded Towns and Cities
  
JK's Skyrim
  
Dawn of Skyrim
  
Complete Solitude
  
Beautiful Whiterun
  
Perfect Whiterun
  
Cutting Room Floor 
  
Riverwood Reborn 2
  
...and hundreds of other mods that I happen to use!
  
(Note: Compatibility testing was completed in 2015, in Old Skyrim, and I can't speak to any changes that may have happened with the above mods in the years since. If you notice clipping with another mod installed, it's best that you request a patch from the maker of that mod, or create your own. All assets in this mod are free to use and redistribute with credit to InsanitySorrow for the original meshes and textures.)
