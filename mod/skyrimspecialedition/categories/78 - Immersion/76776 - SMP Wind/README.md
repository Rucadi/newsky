This mod adds wind-like forces to any SMP-enabled object in any outdoor location. Intensity depends on weather and altitude.
  
  
SMP-enabled items are not included and must be installed separately. Any installed SMP-enabled item will be affected by wind; no special installation procedure is required. However, different items may respond very differently, depending on their physical properties.
  
  
Several parameters of the wind force can be configured, including the overall intensity, the influence of altitude and the amount of fluctuation and noise. This can be done via an in-game configuration menu (MCM), provided by an optional ESP file. Settings are stored in your user file area and persist between playthroughs.
