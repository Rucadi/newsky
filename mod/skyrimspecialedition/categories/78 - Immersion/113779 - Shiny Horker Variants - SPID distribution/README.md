# Shiny Horker Variants - SPID distribution
- Author: Opethfeldt - Bectile
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/113779


Distributes the 8 variants of Opethfeldt's lovely horker textures among the Skyrim horkers.  There are four colors: white, grey, black, and brown, with two skin types for each, "fat" or "wrinkley".
  
  
Only newly spawned horkers will get the skins.. so you can either clear an area and wait for them to respawn, or stay away until the cell resets. To test if the skins are working, you can open the console and type
  
player.placeatme 23AB1 1
  
(this will spawn a new horker at your location).
  
  
The distribution is entirely random and handled by SPID. If you use Dynamic Animal Variants SPID you can let either mod overwrite, it's the same script. And you should comment out the horkers from their \_DISTR.ini, there are instructions in the ini file itself. 
  
  
The original textures mod is not required... the naming and file structure I had to redo for this mod to work. But please swing by the [Shiny Horkers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/113029) mod page and endorse!! Without those textures this mod has no reason to exist.
  
  
I have also included a modified texture for the brown which mutes it and makes the front leg seams much less visible. My ENB/lighting/weather had the brown horkers **very** red. The other colors are also a little darker but the red was too bright for me. I use Pi-Cho ENB, Azurite Weather, and Lanterns of Skyrim II for my lighting. Your game may vary! Try the original textures first if you liked the screenshots in the original mod page
  
  
Note: there was a 4k normal map available in the original mod which I did not include for performance sake. You can always download it from the original mod and replace the 2k ones I have included if you want.
  
  
**PATCHES***Solstheim patch* - allows the horkers in Solstheim to be reskinned as well - do not use if you have a Blood Horker replacer!
  
*Vigilant patch* - prevents the Vigilant monsters who use the horker race from being transformed into horkers with this mod. Sorry. XD
