> By default the affected comments are triggered when the player gets closer than 150 units (game setting *fAIMinGreetingDistance*) to the NPC. This mod adds the requirement for the NPC to be no more than 20 degrees (mod ini setting *MaxDeviationAngle*) sideways from the direction the player character is facing.
