"See that ruin over there, that's Bleak Falls Barrow. My gran used to tell me stories of that place..."
  
  
Remember first stepping out of Helgen, looking across the White River gorge flowing out of Lake Ilinalta and seeing Bleak Falls Barrow for the first time? I wanted to reciprocate that sense of wonder into some of Skyrim's other landmarks. Specifically, the statues around the province. I found the size and nature of the statue to Azura eerie, as though it watched you from atop it's peak - until you went anywhere south of Winterhold that is. And in my head, the statue of Meridia was more of a landmark than I realise it was. And I imagined the Talos statue near Windhelm was built to watch over the city, though it never seemed that way.
  
  
So, I present the Majestically Massive Monuments of Skyrim. Azura is thrice the size, Meridia femtuple the size, and I didn't measure Talos. But there's a fox near him who you can ask. Besides that theres not really much else to say. More cool screenshots would be welcome. I may update this myself or add to it by request. I hope you enjoy!
  
  
Recommended to get 4K/8K textures for the statues. And run Dyndolod before complaining this doesn't work.
