**"I want a real home, real parents. Not... *this*."** 
  
**- Blaise**
  
  
When Blaise uttered those words, he was still an orphan working at Katla's farm and sleeping outside by the stables. Apart from longing to have a real roof over his head, it's safe to say he did indeed dream of real parents--not the wordless automaton masquerading as your spouse.
  
  
Heart-To-Heart aims to change that.

**Your spouse will now acknowledge your children's existence and interact with them about a variety of subjects.** 
  
  
Topics will vary depending on where you are living or visiting, so if you use a mod to take your children and spouse traveling, there's a good chance they will converse while there. Additionally, children will strike up conversations with certain family dogs and make them the recipients of their dreams, fears, and secrets.
  
  
Currently covering 6 of the vanilla spouse voice types, Heart-To-Heart contains above or around 280 conversation scenes.
  
  
**Voice Types Covered:**
  
  
Spouses - Male Brute, Male Nord, Male Dark Elf, Female Even Toned, Female Nord, Female Condescending
  
  
Children - Male Child, Female Child, \*Male Unique Aventus Aretino
  
  
Dogs - CrDogVoice (This is the base game voice type for dogs. Dawnguard coverage will arrive later for Huskies and such.)
  
  
\* = Note concerning Aventus.
  
Spoiler Aventus' voice lines were created after much experimentation with the default Male Child's voice lines in the program of Audacity. Once the closest fit to Aventus' usual pitch and tempo were was found, every H2H line that had been made for the Male Child voice type was recreated and then modified accordingly.
  
  
This included spacing out some of his words so that none of his lines would sound unnaturally rushed or lose their nuance. As always, everything was spliced with great care.

**Scene Locations:**
  
  
Whiterun (the city), The Bannered Mare, Breezehome, Markarth (the city), The Silver-Blood Inn, Vlindrel Hall, Solitude (the city), The Winking Skeever, Proudspire Manor, Windhelm (the city), Candlehearth Hall, Hjerim, Riften (the city), The Bee and Barb, Honeyside, Dead Man's Drink (Falkreath's inn), Lakeview Manor, The Windpeak Inn (Dawnstar's inn), Heljarchen Hall, The Moorside (Morthal's inn), Windstad Manor.
  
  
Custom homes will have access to what I like to term "Any Home" conversations, provided they have the appropriate keyword for Player homes attached to them.
  
  
**Compatibility:**
  
  
Heart-To-Heart contains no direct edits to NPCs or locations, and consists of all new dialogue records. It should not conflict with anything.
  
  
**Installation:**
  
  
You can install Heart-To-Heart any time you wish. Do be aware that there are a couple of Start Enabled dialogue quests included, so if you are not trying Heart-To-Heart on a brand new game, you will need to make a save and reload it for the changes to take effect.

**Other Questions:**
  
  
**Can this be an ESL?**
  
  
No. With 3156 records, Heart-To-Heart is poised to grow bigger with each update, and I *do* intend to update it. Furthermore, let me just inform you that I am a Skyrim LE player/creator, and I will not tolerate you pushing me to support a format I cannot test properly.
  
  
**Are houses from Creation Club covered?**
  
  
In light of the answer to the above question? Surely you jest. However... If they have the appropriate keyword attached, they will have access to "Any Home" conversations, just like any other custom home.
  
  
**Hey, wasn't this part of Denizens of Morthal?**
  
  
The request for family conversation scenes was originally made by Nexus user Gamingismyhobby when Denizens of Morthal first released, and it subsequently kicked off the original notorious (to Denizens users) 1.3 update. That particular version of 1.3 never surfaced primarily because of burnout.
  
  
Every conversation scene between the children with the Male Brute, Male Nord, Male Dark Elf, and Female Nord voice types was completed in April of 2020-2021, but by then my knowledge of the Creation Kit had grown and I began to expand Denizens in many other ways, which is primarily why a new version called Denizens of Hjaalmarch began to take shape.
  
  
Denizens of Hjaalmarch is very much a monster of a passion project, though, and it will not appeal to everyone, so over time the idea of cutting the family conversations out of it and making them standalone became both appealing and sensible.
  
  
It was no picnic to do so, either. Aside from the audio already created, I had to remake everything from scratch. One good thing came out of this, however: I made use of my newfound knowledge of "Shared Dialogue" and made custom responses and quests to accommodate it. This should make any potential translators out there vastly happy.
  
**What are the custom Keywords for?**
  
  
Exploring the esp, are we? Those were created for the Morthal scenes between spouses and daughters.
  
  
Three years ago, Reddit user Robynrainbow asked me if it would be possible for not all of the girls to give the same frightened response to the Morthal swamp. In response, I came up with a keyword system and made special scenes that would play based on whether the girl was Nervous or Brave. I took into account each girl's background (orphan or not) and assigned them a keyword via a quest that runs in the background.
  
  
**What is the weirdly named Global Variable for?**
  
  
H2HzapReserve4DoH is used to block certain dialogue that fits only with Denizens of Hjaalmarch's lore and events for certain characters. It may or may not actually be used, because I ended up cutting most of the DoH specific scenes out for Heart-To-Heart's release.
  
  
The only survivors of the purge include Benor and Valdimar's responses for living in Hjaalmarch, Valdimar's responses any time a child shows enthusiasm for the Legion or the Stormcloaks, and Erandur's response for the Temple of Mara scene with a daughter. If Valdimar's war-faction related reactions seem too jarring for anyone not using Denizens (of Morthal or Hajaalmarch), let me know and I will block them off in an update.
