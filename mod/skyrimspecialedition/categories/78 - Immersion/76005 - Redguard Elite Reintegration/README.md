# Redguard Elite Reintegration

The Redguard Elite armor is absolutely gorgeous, and is easily one of my favorite sets in the game. Unfortunately, I can't give as much praise to the quest involved with actually obtaining it. Interception has you running all around Skyrim, talking to random NPCs with extremely limited dialogue, and basically just completing a giant fetch quest with the only (extremely) cool part being the climax. As much as I enjoy watching Alik'r silently eliminate a group of Thalmor while invisible, the absolute slog required to get there is just not enjoyable. I made this mod so that I could skip the quest entirely, and instead distributed the beautiful armor to Kematu and his band of Alik'r during the quest In My Time of Need.

  
  
Details:
  

  
* Removes the Interception quest and the NPCs introduced with the Creation
Distributes the Remnant equipment to the Alik'r NPCs that visit Whiterun, those involved in the world encounter where they interrogate a Redguard woman, and the guards within Swindler's Den
  
* Distributes the enchanted Remnant equipment to Kematu, as well as the Remnant Scimitar of Fire and the unique Boneshaver
If completing the quest in favor of Kematu, the player will also be gifted a full set of Remnant equipment in addition to the 500 gold reward
  
* Changes all crafting recipes to require completion of In My Time of Need, and removes all quest-based restrictions from tempering recipes

  
Installation:
  
A fresh save is required in order for the NPCs associated with the quest to be removed and the quest avoided. I do not recommend uninstalling this mod at any point during a playthrough, and will be unable to provide troubleshooting assistance if you decide to do so.
  
  
Compatibility:
  
This mod directly edits the NPC records of Kematu and his group, the crafting and tempering recipes of the Remnant equipment, and the quest In My Time of Need. As long as a mod does not touch those records, this is fully compatible. All appropriate Update and USSEP changes to In My Time of Need have been forwarded.
