What it do:
  
  
When you're wearing rich clothing, you get slightly better deals with vendors. Not a super big bonus, but enough to incentivize you take off your armor and stop intimidating Belethor when you're selling your loot.
  
  
  
  
  
How Mod works:
  
Learning Papyrus scripting, this is my first practice mod so don't expect it to be perfect. It attaches a script to the player, which runs every time something is un/equipped. If the player is wearing anything with the "ClothingRich" keyword, it applies a spell with a magic effect, which is about 15% better prices.
