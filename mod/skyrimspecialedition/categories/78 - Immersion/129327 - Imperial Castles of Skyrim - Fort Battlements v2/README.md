**Description**
  
*"Imperial walls and towers used to make me feel so safe..."* 
  
- Ralof
  
  
I've always felt the same way as Ralof. Castles in the Elder Scrolls games used to look much more like, well... castles. This mod tries to bring Skyrim's Imperials back to their former glory by adding parapets, battlements, and facade machicolations to all Imperial forts, towers, and ruins in Skyrim and Solstheim
  
  
  
**New wall and tower designs inspired by:**
  
Castle Bruma (Oblivion),
  
Castle Dawnguard (Skyrim),
  
and loosely, Castle Warwick, (England). 
  
  
  
**Don't Forget to Endorse!**

**Performance****Virtually zero FPS loss** 
  
In my testing this mod generates roughly an additional 100-500 draw calls in the largest Imperial forts (almost nothing, even compared to vanilla). So if you can run vanilla Skyrim with no problems, you're good to go!
  
  
  
  
**Compatibility****Incompatibe with mods that move vanilla Imperial walls or towers. Mods adding new forts/towers/ruins are compatible but will not recieve the new battlements.**
  
**This mod is NOT a model replacer.** Due to how vanilla forts are constructed, new wall parts are independent objects. This also helps the mod play nice with others, grants virtually no chance of CTDs, and makes it extremely easy to patch for down the road. However, you will only see the new walls and towers in locations covered by this mod and it's patches. These new models also function as **dynamic navcuts**, keeping draw calls down and eliminating the need for any navmesh edits or collision markers. **Textures and decals** for the new models will use whatever textures you have installed for more seemless integration and full compatibility with texture overhauls. **Parallax** mesh options are available in the FOMOD. **Lods** for DynDOLOD included by default.

**Notes for Mod Authors**
  
You are free to use my models however you like in your own work or to make any patches/addons for this mod. I will be uploading a Resources for Mod Authors plugin to the Misc files section that has everything already set up and ready to use in the Creation Kit. You are not allowed to charge money for any project that uses my files. You have open permission to port this mod and its patches/addons to any console as long as you credit me as the creator. However, please make sure that no ports of the specific files already exist on the platform. I don't want console players to have to sort through 10 different versions of the same mod. For all other use cases, feel free to ask me for permissions, I'll probably allow it.
