**﻿YOU HAVE COME! YOU HAVE COME TO HEAR THE WORD OF TALOS!**

  
  
[left][/left]Ever think it's weird that nothing ever happens to Windhelm's Temple of Talos if the Empire wins the Civil War? Or that Markarth's Shrine of Talos stays closed and empty even if the Stormcloaks take over the city? With all the shrines out in the wilderness, wouldn't it be nice to encounter a pilgrim or two?
  
  
This mod adds a series of dynamic changes and immersive details to several locations where Talos is worshipped. These changes are themed around being able to see the impact of the Thalmor and the Civil War on Talos worship in Skyrim. This mod also makes some cosmetic improvements to a few of these locations that are outside cities.
  
  
This mod adds several new NPCs, including new priests, worshippers, and Thalmor agents, most of which have carefully splice voice lines. For extra immersion, there are even a few conditional lines. For example, if you question the pilgrim at Cradlecrush Pond as a High Elf, he'll deny being a Talos worshipper, and some NPCs may have friendlier greetings if you’re a fellow Nord.
  
  
  
*\*\*\* This mod requires the latest Environs Master Plugin, found [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/91160).
  
\*\*\* Ok to install mid-game.
  
\*\*\* Safe to update from v3.00. Do not update from earlier.*

Skyrim's world space tends to feel very static. Despite a civil war, dragons, and vampires, not much ever changes. The Environs series implements changes that take place over time to help make the land of Skyrim feel more alive, to help give a sense that events are occurring and time was passing throughout a playthrough.

**Shrine near Lake Illinalta, Falkreath Hold**(unmarked vanilla location)
  
In vanilla, there is a scene here with a group of massacred Talos worshippers. Now, they’ll be alive for a while earlier in your playthrough. Later on however, you can stumble upon the vanilla scene where they’ve been killed. Triggered by a level requirement. Also includes visual improvements such as new clutter and foliage.
  
  
**Thalmor Headquarters, Solitude**
  
The Thalmor agent normally found dead at the Illinalta shrine can be found here, at least until the massacre is triggered. No changes to the cell.
  
  
**Cradlecrush Pond Shrine, Eastmarch**
  
(unmarked vanilla location)
  
A pilgrim will eventually arrive at the pond near Cradlecrush Rock. He'll camp on the opposite shore across from the shrine. Triggered by player level. Also adds several objects to enhance the natural beauty of this location, including a few extra trees and logs, several plants, a piece of cliff, and clutter.
  
  
**White River Valley Shrine, Whiterun Hold**
  
(unmarked vanilla location)
  
After completing the quest to deliver Torygg's War Horn, a lone worshipper can be found here if you return. Also includes visual improvements such as new clutter and foliage.
  
  
**Weynon Stones, The Pale**
  
There will be a violent scene that eventually appears here: several pilgrims travelling to the Talos shrine who appear to have been murdered. It will also eventually disappear, leaving only a few bones behind. Triggered by player level. No major changes to this location.
  
  
**Riften Shrine of Talos**
  
In the vanilla game the priest who tends this shrine, Nura Snow-Shod, typically remains confined in her house if the Empire controls Riften. Now the garden surrounding the statue will also deteriorate due to her absence. The shrine will be removed as well, and a Thalmor Justiciar will arrive in the city. He can be found in the Keep or patrolling the streets.
  
  
**Snow-Shod Manor, Riften**
  
If the Empire controls Riften, a shrine of Talos will be added to the basement here, implying that Nura Snow-Shod is still worshipping Talos secretly.
  
  
**Markarth Shrine of Talos**
  
If the Stormcloaks take control of Markarth, the Shrine of Talos will be reopened. A new priest will arrive to tend the shrine and live in the city. New clutter will be added to the interior that reflects this. A bedroll will also be added in Understone Keep for the priest, near Calcelmo.
  
  
**Temple of Talos, Windhelm**
  
If the Empire wins the Civil War and controls Windhelm, the Talos shrine will be removed from this temple. The two priests, Jora and Lortheim, will leave the city and go into hiding. The braziers and candles will be burnt out, making the Temple to feel more lonely and empty. 
  
  
This idea is actually based on a [vanilla dialogue scene](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Jora) between Jora and Niranye, in which Niranye offers them help get out of the city with the aid of her 'contacts'.
  
  
**New hidden location, The Rift**
  
If Jora and Lortheim flee Windhelm, they will go into hiding somewhere in the Rift. New interior cell. This cell behaves dynamically as well; before the priests arrive, it will be darker and emptier. See if you can find them :)
  
  
**On the road East of Darkwater Crossing, Eastmarch**
  
The remains of a Thalmor patrol that encountered some local wildlife can be found here. Triggered by player level, and eventually disappears.

This mod should be relatively compatible, as it affects locations not touched by many other mods. A patch collection is provided under 'Optional Files'. Patch list below.
  
  
This mod does not touch the Civil War, and should be compatible with mods that overhaul it. The dynamic changes triggered by the Civil war in this mod are scriptless; they are simply attached to the same markers that enable vanilla Civil War changes, such as guard uniforms, banners, etc.

**Lanterns of Skyrim II**
  
My attempt at a consistency patch for several new exterior lights. You may not notice much of a difference though.
  
  
**Lux**Resolves lighting conficts, and implements Lux's lighting design to the new interior. 
  
  
**Lux Orbis**
  
Resolves several small confilcts, applies Lux Orbis' design to new exterior lighting.
  
  
**Open Cities**
  
Moves objects previously in the Riften world space to the new space provided by Open Cities. This patch has not been thoroughly tested, and I'm not super familiar with Open Cities, but it appears to work fine. Let me know if you find issues.
  
  
**Skyrim Immersive Creatures**
  
Disables two skeletons at the Illinalta Shrine until after the massacre there.
  
  
**Solitude and Temple Frescoes 2019 - by Spartan Sith118**
  
THERE ARE MANY FRESCO MOD VERSIONS OUT THERE. ENSURE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT PATCH FOR THE RIGHT VERSION. ONLY for the mod by SpartanSith118. Available for both the main file (esp plugin), and ESL file (under miscellaneous files). You do not need this patch for the "Solitude Only" version. If you find it too confusing, just skip this patch and let Environs - Shrines of Talos and its patches overwrite Frescoes in your load order, it's not a major issue.
  
  
**The Thalmor's Shadow - Taliesin (Custom Voiced Follower)**
  
Taliesin will now appear only after the massacre at the Illinalta shrine. Level requirement reduced to 5 so you can find him early on. Also disabled the quest to find him that begins automatically on startup, because otherwise it would point there before he appears.
  
  
**Wraiths**
  
For the mod by 4thunknown. Disables wraiths at two shrine locations while new NPCs are there.
