EDIT: This series is for the most part discontinued. This may sound hypocritical, and perhaps it is, but I have an aversion to using AI generative tools now for these mods. It's simply not comparable to work created by real human talent. There is no soul. I'll always appreciate my community, and the fans around my work. But for the foreseeable future, I will not use AI again. I will remain a modder, however, all voice work shall be done through genuine, talented voice-actors. Either way, thank you all for your support and appreciation all the same. 
  
  
  
Hey, so this one was a doozy. In short (but not so short as to be constrained within a miniscule 350 character limit), this mod adds an abundance of "Greet" dialogue to NPCS pertaining to: the player's race (Beast races are looked down upon in a major way by many of the bigoted residents for example, same as Elves and Imperials); the player's Sex; the player's allegiance and service in the Civil War respective of each side; and finally, the quests the player has completed that are unique to Windhelm.
  
  
On top of this, there's 30 additional scenes added to the Windhelm 'pool'. There are eighteen new scenes in Candlehearth; four new market scenes; three new Cornerclub scenes; two new scenes between Viola and Captain. Lonely-Gale; two new dockworker scenes (previously there were zero); and one new blacksmith scene. As with the dialogue, a portion of these scenes rely on the player completing quests (Innocence Lost, CW Imperial victory, CW Stormcloaks victory, an Argonian player completing the quest "Blood On the Ice"). 
  
  
A major goal of this mod was to add life to the NPCS and give the player the impression there's a living, breathing world + of course...people were always just too friendly in Windhelm. 
  
  
Let me know what ya'll think! Till next time (It might be a while--this one took some work)!

\*Compatible with everything. 
  
  
**\*I highly, highly recommend downloading and enabling "Realistic Conversations" by "Gorgulla". With this enabled, you can hear the conversations play out more than Vanilla. https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1717**
  
  
\*And let me give a hearty thank you to "YoungEmmaWatson" for porting many of my mods to Xbox already; your work is noticed and appreciated... If you wish to port, YoungEmma, no permission needed, my friend. 
  
  
Dialogue Expansion - Keeper Carcette sometime in the fture (With a real voice actress this time - praise Talos) 
  
Windhelm Gate Enforcement - will be done sometime in the future with non-ai, real talent. 
  
  
**Disclaimer: I do not condone any dialogue created via 11labs (or any other source of AI voice synthesis technology) that is heinous, perverse, lewd, defamatory, and/or disrespectful to the voice actors/actresses and/or their in-game portrayal. I do not accept donation points, nor shall I ever set up a means to derive compensation from these lines of mods in any way, IE: Patreon, Paypal, Cashapp, etc.**
  
  
An enormous thank you to "quietlychamil" for their work in creating custom race compatibility patches. 
  
  
A giant thank you to all the translators out there: you know who you are! Much love.
  
  
Let me give a major thank you to BGS and the following Voice Actors/Voice Actresses in the original cast of Skyrim. Their performances far - farrrrrrrr - outshine the world of AI synthesis technology. Thank you for bringing Skyrim to life all those years back.
