?OSL Aroused?
  
 High-performance, SKSE-based rewrite of SexLab Aroused.**[/b]
> **OSL Aroused aims to fix everything the old SLA system struggled with** - slow scripts, bloated saves, outdated nudity logic, and fragile compatibility.
>   
>   
> Rebuilt from scratch in SKSE, it delivers **instant updates**, **no script overhead**, **zero bloat**, and **automatic support** for SexLab, OStim, Devious Devices, TOYS, and Advanced Nudity Detection (AND).
>   
>   
> Arousal is responsive, realistic, fully configurable, and shared across all frameworks.

**Installation**

  
The mod can be installed like any other mod via a mod manager
  
  
**Do NOT install SexLab Aroused or OAroused.**
  
[line]**FAQ****಄ Will this slow down my game?**
  
No. The mod is almost entirely native C++ and extremely lightweight.

Yes. It fully emulates both, with better performance and cleaner behavior.
  
  
**಄ Is it compatible with Devious Devices, SLS, SLSO, any other mod?**
  
Yes. OSL Aroused is designed to work with all ecosystem mods. Please report any issues.
  
  
**಄ What's the difference between OSL Mode and SLA Mode?**
  
• OSL Mode: modern, smooth, high-performance arousal system
  
• SLA Mode: classic SLA behavior for maximum legacy compatibility
  
  
**಄ Is A.N.D. required?**
  
No. If A.N.D. is installed, advanced nudity scaling activates automatically.
  
If not, the system falls back to classic nudity detection.
  
  
಄ **Can I Disable OAroused.esp or SexLabAroused.esm**
  
If you do not have any mods that depend on either or, \*yes\* you can disable them. They are \*not\* required for this mod to run. They are provided for backwards compatibility with mods that depend on them.
