*Optimised versions of some of the scripts used by the **Read the Room - Immersive and Animated Helmet Management** mod. Requires the original mod. Does not change any functionality except for improving efficiency.*

  
  
Requirements
  
- The original [Read the Room](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77605) mod. Specifically, version 2.2.1.
  
- SKSE
  
- [powerofthree's Papyrus Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22854)
  
  
  
Changes made by this patch
  
[color=#ffffff][size=3]- Optimisations in scripts: most small micro-optimisations, but also a major and important improvement using po3's Papyrus Extender (OnMagicEffectApplyEx instead of OnMagicEffectApply events, huge potential impact in load orders with many mods).
  
- [size=4][size=3]No changes in functionality (aside from possibly some improvements in efficiency). [/size][/size]
  
  
[/size][/color]Installation
  
[color=#ffffff][size=3]- Same as any other standard mod, recommend installing using a Mod Manager.
  
- Note that this is not a full mod, just a patch.
  
- Clean saving should not be required, though to be 100% safe, try to create the saved game for which you first install this file in a quiet
  
place with no combat going on. Also try to wait for at least a couple of seconds after entering whichever cell you create your saved game in before creating the save.
