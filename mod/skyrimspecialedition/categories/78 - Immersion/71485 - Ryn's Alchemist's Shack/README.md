[font=Georgia]Part of Ryn's Skyrim
  
  
An ongoing project with the goal of bringing Skyrim's Worldspace to a more updated level of detail with new locations, improved locations, and more interesting encounters, all while generally sticking to Bethesda's style of level design, and with performance and mod compatibility for the average player in mind.

Ryn's Alchemist's Shack
  
  
A once very boring location with no personality, now a small hidden grove of alchemical experimentation.
  
In my quest to update every location in Skyrim to a more modern feel, I've expanded upon Bethesda's idea here, and made the Alchemist's Shack a place worth traveling to, even if only to look at the beautiful statue of our Dunmer-loved Azura.
  
An increase in the base-structure's size, adding a store room for not only a more believable home layout, but to differentiate this structure from *every other shack in the game that is built the **exact** same way.*And an increase and reorganization of the alchemical ingredients outside, while keeping it balanced and exciting. After all, you don't exactly have to fight anything to get to the stuff.
