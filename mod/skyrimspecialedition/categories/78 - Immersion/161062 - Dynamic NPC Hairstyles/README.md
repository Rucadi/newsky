I love radiant story telling, I love when NPCs have a will of their own and I love when the world evolves as you play. These three concepts will go hand-in-hand as part of this mod.
  
  
**Features:**

  
* Some NPCs will change their hairstyle dynamically after time passes. Every new season means a possible new hairstyle.
Hairstyles are chosen randomly from a selected pool of appropiate hairstyles.
  
* Some NPCs (bald NPCs) and certain hairstyles (crazy hairstyles like Mohawks, balding, etc.) are exempted from the system.
If you have hair scissors in your inventory (from Dirt and Blood or this mod) and you're talking to a friendly NPC, you can ask the NPC if they'd like a new haircut.
  
* Mod is fully voiced with fun responses from the NPCs (Reused vanilla lines).
Very light approach: Mod uses SPID and KID to hand out the spells and keywords necessary for the mod to function. Script runs only once at the beginning of the season.
  
* Easy to expand: the mod uses the amazing hairstyles from Vanilla Hair Remake to do its thing, but you can expand the selection of hairstyles by adding hairstyles to the right formlist.
If you are NOT interested in the dynamic hairstyle aspect of the mod, the FOMOD will allow you to disable the random part of the mod, while keeping the other features, such as the dialogue to manually change a follower's hairstyle.
  

**Requirements**:

* [Helmet Toggle 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/100617)﻿ has just received a new update to be compatible with this mod (and it's an awesome mod by an awesome author).

**Is it ESL flagged?**
  
Duh, yes.
  
  
**I want an NPC exempted!**You can add them to the blacklist formlist (using xEdit), or through the MCM, or through SPID, or just talk to the NPC with a set of hair scissors in your inventory and tell them you liked their hair better before. This requires you are friendly with the NPC (or disabling the friend requiement in the MCM).
  
  
**How does the mod work? Is it a wig? I hate wigs!**Technically the new hairstyles are "wigs", but they do NOT behave like your typical wigs. They will NOT show up in the inventory of the NPC (they're invisible to the player) and they're automatically equipped by the NPC whenever they don't have a helmet or hat on, so in practice they behave just like "real" hair. 
  
  
**I want to add support for the hairstyles of mod X!**If the hairstyles are equippable via an armor item, just add them to the Elf / Khajiit / Human formlist. It's as simple as that.
  
  
**I can't see the dialogue option!**
  
For the dialogue option to show up, the NPC you're talking to must not have a helmet or hood equipped, they must be friendly with you, and you must have hair scissors in your inventory.
  
  
**Why are Argonians not supported in the mod? You racist lizard hater!**
  
Argonian hairstyles often come with physical changes beyond a simple hairstyle, such as the position of their horns in their head. It would not be fitting to change those dynamically. 
  
**Can I configure the chances of an NPC getting a new haircut?**
  
Yes, the fomod includes an option for 100% of characters, 75%, 50%, 25% or even 0%. You can also just modify the SPID file to your liking.
  
  
**I'm using your modlist "[Gate to Sovngarde](https://www.nexusmods.com/games/skyrimspecialedition/collections/qdurkx)". Can I use this mod?**The mod will be added to v97, but v97 is still weeks away as I'm working on some very cool things for it. If you want to add the mod to GTS already, 1) install the main file from this mod, 2) install the optional file from this mod, 3) update [Helmet Toggle 2,](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/100617)﻿ 4) install [Hair Colour Sync](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/121751) and 5) install the [wig file](https://www.nexusmods.com/Core/Libs/Common/Widgets/DownloadPopUp?id=510410&game_id=1704&nmm=1) of Vanilla Hair Remake.
