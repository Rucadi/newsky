# Winterhold No Smoldering Rubble

I was out looking for conflicts between [Nordic Wall Ruins for Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66740) and [JK's Skyrim (AIO)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6289) when I noticed them: still-smoldering piles of planks and other rubble at the bottom of Winterhold's collapsed cliffs. Could they have been the remains of some adventurer's campfire from the night before? Or had a dragon just rolled through? Surely not, the piles were too disorderly and there were no other burn marks.
  
  
Clearly, they were a reference to the [The Great Collapse](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Great_Collapse), which befell Winterhold in 4E 122. However, the [events of Skyrim](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Skyrim) occur in 4E 201. That's an ~80 year gap. Why is the rubble still smoldering?
  
  
This mod disables several piles of smoldering rubble found in the **vanilla** game, fixing the timeline inconsistency. JK's Skyrim adds a few more in the area, so grab the alternative patch if you use that mod.
  
  
Should be compatible with most overhauls since it just disables records. If you still see smoldering rubble, check that this mod is loading after all other Winterhold overhauls. If you come across mods adding more smoldering rubble that you'd like patched, please let me know.
