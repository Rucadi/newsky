**~~ This mod is provided as-is, and may not work on modern version of Castle Volkihar Rebuilt. I don't use almost any of Arthmoor's mods anymore, and therefore don't intend to update this. Anyone that wishes to is free to update it themselves and repost it, all that I ask is credit for the original and for the voice acting included, since it's my voice used for Rungvald. ~~
  
  
  
- Summary -**
  
  
This mod is primarily aimed at those who like to avoid fast travel as much as possible. It adds some convenience to moving around and away from Castle Volkihar that might become an issue once one realizes the size of Castle Volkihar after cleaning it up via Arthmoor's "[Castle Volkihar Rebuilt](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/324/?)"
  
  
  
  
**- What It Does -**
  
  
**This mod does six things :**
  
*i* - Adds a shortcut from the Volkihar Main Hall to the Docks, reducing the distance from 3 loading screens to 1.
  
*ii* - Adds dinghies to Icewater Jetty and the front of Castle Volkihar to allow quicker and more convenient travel to the Volkihar Port. 
  
*iii* - Adds a captain, Rungvald Stormchaser, to the Volkihar Port to make use of the longboat added by Arthmoor, allowing travel to the Major Port Cities and Solstheim.
  
*iv* - Adds a fast travel marker to the Volkihar Port.
  
*v* - Reduces the cost of travel from other ports to Volkihar from 500 gold to 50.
  
*vi* - Moves the arrival for travel from other ports to Volkihar from the Icewater Jetty to the Volkihar Port
  
  
  
  
**- Information -**
  
- The dinghies taking the player from Icewater Jetty and the front of Volkihar Castle to the Volkihar Port are enabled by default. These can be ignored until later if desired.
  
- The dinghies taking the player from Volkihar ports to the Castle Front and Icewater Jetty, as well as the shortcut leading from the Docks to the Castle Hall, are disabled until the ports are cleaned up by the player via Arthmoor's "[Castle Volkihar Rebuilt](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/324/?)", at which point a lever will become visible to activate the assets added by this mod.
  
- The shortcut leading from the Castle Hall to the docks is disabled until the passage from the Castle Hall to the Courtyard are cleaned up by the player via Arthmoor's "[Castle Volkihar Rebuilt](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/324/?)", at which point a lever will become visible in the stairway leading to the courtyard to activate the assets added by this mod.
  
- Travel from Castle Volkihar to Solstheim is disabled until either the player arrives in Solstheim via the Dragonborn Main Quest, or, if you've already arrived in Solstheim via other means, it can be enabled at Rungvald Stormchaser with the "- Solstheim Override-" dialogue option. **I highly recommend against enabling Solstheim travel from Volkihar until the player has traveled there via Gjalund's ship in Windhelm. This is to avoid any unwanted issues with scripts etc. in the DLC.**

**- Requirements & Installation -**
  
  
Requires Arthmoor's "[Castle Volkihar Rebuilt](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/324/?)"
  
  
-----
  
  
Install via MO or NMM by using the "Download with Manager" button under the files section.
  
  
Install manually by moving the contents of the VolkiharTravel.rar into the Skyrim Data folder.
  
  
  
  
**- Uninstallation -**
  
**WARNING: If you don't follow these steps, you will have holes in your castle.**
  
  
Uninstall correctly by going to the "Volkihar Travel" MCM menu, and making sure both settings there are changed to "Disabled". These settings will not be changeable until after the first time you switch the levers to activate this mod proper.
  
  
Once everything looks like it did pre-installation you're set to go and can uninstall the mod without fear of drafty castles.
  
  
  
**- Known Issues -**
  
  
- When speaking with the Ferrymen who take you from the Major Port Cities on pre-existing saves, the chat option to travel to Volkihar will display its' cost as 500 Gold. This is just a display issue, and it will still only cost 50 gold.
  
  
- A common issue seems to be people not being able to talk to Rungvald. The cause is unknown, but I suspect it's other dialogue mods. This should theoretically be fixed in 1.3, but I'm awaiting confirmation.
