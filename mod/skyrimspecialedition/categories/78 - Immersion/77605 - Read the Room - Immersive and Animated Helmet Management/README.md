﻿[font=Georgia]**Read the Room**[/font]
  
Do you find it odd that the player character is the only one at the inn wearing a helmet? 
  
  
Did you spend four hours on the character creation screen only to never see your players face again?
  
  
Do you miss out on using incredible looking helmets due to stubbornness?
  
  
Yeah me too. But no longer.

Update 2.2.0 details (**Follower Support, Combat Equip, and Increased Customization**):
  
Spoiler

  
* (New Feature) Follower Support: Functionality is distributed to active followers via SPID. The majority of vanilla and modded followers work out of the box, but some (such as my boy Inigo) will require a future patch to get Read the Room monitoring. Follower support can be toggled in the MCM and followers generally follow the same equip/unequip criteria as the main player.
(New Feature) Combat Equip: An option to automatically equip helmets when entering combat has been added. When enabled player/followers will immediately equip their headgear when entering combat. Another MCM option "Combat Equip Animation" dictates whether the equipping animation will play for the player when entering combat. If disabled headgear will pop straight from the hip to head without the need to wait for the animation to play. (Combat equip animations do not trigger for followers. Followers will always immediately equip the headgear with no animation if combat equip is enabled)
  
* (New Options) MCM Additions:

        - Manage Followers: Enables/disables follower support
  
        - Manage Circlets: Enables/disables automatic management of circlets (toggle key will still work for circlets if disabled)
  
        - Combat Equip: Enables/disables automatic equip of headgear when entering combat
  
        - Combat Equip Animation: Enables/disables animation for combat equip
  
        - Complete Control of Headgear Placement: MCM now includes options for both helmet and circlet hand and hip position placements (hand position
  
          governs location of item during animation sequence). Separate options for male and female placements have also been added
  
        - Require Torso Armor: Option to remove placed helmets on actors that do not have a chest piece equipped.
  

  
* (Bug Fixes) A number of bugs have been addressed in the update
  
  
Update 2.1.0 details (**Circlet Support/Hood Improvements**):
  
Spoiler
  

  
* (New Feature) Circlets are now supported. Circlets use the same animation's as helmets, but have tweaked positions to improve animation and display alignment. Hip positioning/rotation can be tweaked in the MCM and circlet settings are unique to helmet settings so that both can be tweaked individually
(New Feature) Limited Hood support. Some of the main game hoods (that are exclusively a headgear item) are now supported and can be lowered into their lowered versions (thanks to [Lowered Hoods](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29661?tab=description)﻿' models). Lowering happens via the monitor or by hotkey in the same manner as helmets. **Specific hood lowering animation to be added.**
  
* (Bug Fix) Hoods that do not have a lowered hood version will now be excluded from this mods usage. In the future I will add a way for headgear specific hoods to be equipped/unequipped via this mod, but I have not yet included differentiation between normal hoods and "hoods" such as full body robes that have a hood.
  
  
Update 2.0.0 details (**Unlocked Animation Movement and ESL flagged**):
  
Spoiler
  

  
* Mod is now ESL flagged
(New Feature) Movement is now unlocked during equip/unequip animations
  
* (New Feature) Added hotkey to remove all helmets placed by mod
(Revised Feature) Toggle hotkey can now trigger animations in combat. This is meant as a compromise between the possibility of being caught 'unaware' with your helmet unequipped and the helmet automatically equipping when entering combat. Note that while toggle is now enabled in combat, you won't be able to use your weapons during the animation which will leave you vulnerable
  
* (Bug Fix) Bugs involving spam of the toggle key have been resolved
(Bug Fix) Bug where ritual spell animation would play when using toggle with an unsheathed weapon has been resolved
  
* (Bug Fix) Bug where helmet duplication was possible has been resolved
(Bug Fix) Detection of equipped helmet has been reworked, streamlining the scripts and resolving bugs caused by inaccurate detection
  
* (Bug Fix) Helmets will now properly disappear when changing into Werewolf/Vampire Lord
  
  
Update 1.1.0 details (**Requested Features**):
  
Spoiler
  
Changes:
  

  
* (New Feature) Added toggle key to unequip/equip helmet (depending on whether helmet is currently on hip or on head). Assignable in MCM
(New Feature) Added helmet's hip position/rotation adjustment via MCM
  
* (New Feature) Added option to turn off automatic helmet management. Set "Equip when" and "Unequip when" to only with toggle key if you only want to play the animations via hotkey

Updating
  

  
* Just download and deploy the new version. From testing all of the new features will work on existing saves with the exception of the disabling automatic helmet management. The new "toggle key only" option may or may not appear correctly in the MCM after updating (toggle key functionality will work correctly however)

Why?

[/font]**
  

All joking aside I made this mod for two reasons.

  

  
1. I like immersive role-playing, so having a non-tedious way to manage helmet wearing has been on the back of my mind for a while
slavicpotato1's Immersive Equipment Display is not only a hassle free replacement for ALLGUD, it has the capability to revolutionize animation mods. Here I am, a relatively unexperienced modder, and I think I've made something neat. Hopefully more experienced people will take notice of IED's capabilities and make some amazing content.
  

  
[font=Georgia]**The Mod**[/font]
  
 ﻿As seen in the above gifs this mod tracks the location of your character and makes judgements on whether it is a "safe" or "hostile" area. Safe areas are cities, towns, and other dwellings while hostile areas include bandit camps, nordic/dwemer ruins, caves, etc. Depending on how you configure the mod the player will automatically equip their helmet upon entering a hostile zone, or when leaving a safe area. Likewise the helmet unequip animation will automatically trigger when entering a safe zone or upon leaving a hostile one. 
  
  
 ﻿This allows the player to immersively balance wearing a helmet where it would be appropriate, without constant menu interaction or the frequent disappearance/reappearance of the helmet. 
  
  
 ﻿**If you would rather manage your helmet on your own, you can disable automatic equipping/unequipping by setting both options to "Only with toggle key" in the MCM.**
  
  
[font=Georgia]**Installation/Usage**[/font]
  
 ﻿Install with a mod manager, and you're good to go. As soon as you equip or unequip a helmet the mod will start doing it's work. (You do NOT need to apply any presets through Immersive Equipment Displays GUI for this mod). Be sure to check out the requirements, make sure IED is 1.6.3+ and that it is installed correctly.
  
  
 ﻿Be sure to update and run Nemesis via "Nemesis Unlimited Behavior Engine.exe". When running Nemesis there will not be a checkbox for the mod. However "Mod installed: ReadtheRoom" will appear in the console while running.
  
  
[font=Georgia]**Compatibility**[/font]
  
 ﻿Because of how Immersive Equipment Display works this mod should be compatible with almost everything, including mod added armors. The only potential conflict is other mods that include animations on helmet equip. No external edits and no overwritten files. 
  

  
* Immersive Equipment Displays - Mura Presets: The Headhunter Bounty preset will overlap with this mod's helmet placement. I've included an optional file that is just Mura's preset with the headhunter heads moved to the other hip. Apply it like you would her normal preset
Immersive Equipping Animations: ~~Patch to remove double animations when Read the Room's animations play is now in optional files. Let it override Read the Room's main file and re-run Nemesis~~ Patch will be updated after any bugs from 2.2.0 are resolved. For now disable player and follower headgear equip animations in IEAs MCM
  

  
[font=Georgia]**Updating**[/font]
  
 ﻿If you're updating and plan to start a new save, just update and overwrite with your mod manager. However if you want to update mid-save and run into the "blank MCM" issue, the below instructions work to fix the issue. However I will add a disclaimer that the method below is not 100% safe and a save-backup should be made just in case. 
  
Spoiler
  
Before updating the mod:
  

  
* Enter the MCM, click the "Deactivate Mod" or "Remove perk from player" options depending on what version of the mod you are running
Save the game and backup the file somewhere
  
* Disable Read the Room
Reload the game and use the console command "setstage ski\_configmanagerinstance 1"
  
* Wait for the "Read the Room" MCM option to disappear from the MCM menu
Save and close the game
  
* Download [ReSaver](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5031?tab=description) and unzip it somewhere on your machine
﻿Run ReSaver.exe and select your most recent save (sorting by "Date Modified" may be helpful)
  
* Navigate to Clean --> Remove unattached instances

[spoiler]
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/o3s63E3.jpg)
  
  

  
* Use File --> Save to save the cleaned save file

Update the Mod

  
* Reload the game and use the console command "setstage ski\_configmanagerinstance 1"
The updated MCM should now appear correctly
  

  
I apologize for the hassle and confusion on this topic. I'm still a relatively novice modder and this is the first time I've ran into this issue. Thank you for your patience, and if anyone has any tips on how to avoid this issue in future updates I'd appreciate the input.

Uninstall

[/font]**
  
 ﻿I don't recommend removing .esps mid playthrough, but that being said the mod's functionality can be disabled by removing the helper perk via the MCM and clearing the mod's placed helmet references (also via the MCM). Once you've done that you could theoretically uninstall. But the mod is disabled at that point, so why risk it.
