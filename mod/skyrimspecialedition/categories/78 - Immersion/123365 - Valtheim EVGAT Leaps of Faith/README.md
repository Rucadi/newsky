[font=Georgia] ﻿? DESCRIPTION
  
  
I (mostly ?) have trouble getting to that plank, especially when I play with male or taller race characters. Plus, I wanted a cool way to get there. [SkyClimb](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97253) is not prompted when you get closer to the point, the threshold is not sufficient. All these have motivated me to learn some basics of Creation Kit and practise my very first CK-made mod.
  
  
Options available:

* [font=Georgia]2-way: Both inward and outward markers. Why inward? I don't know, you tell me.[/font]
[font=Georgia]1-way: No way back, for the true Nœrds! (Jk, you can regular-jump back.)[/font]
  

[font=Georgia]
  
For 2-way version, I placed a collision marker between the markers. This is how it is done with any close EVGAT markers to avoid activation from other side. For those who don't know, this collision does not block any projectile, be it arrows or spells. But it also blocks jumping regular way to the plank. This is not a cons, since the whole concept of this mod is to implement a new method anyway. If you strive enough, you can find a camera angle where you still can activate the opposite marker; but you will not, unless you intend to it.
  
  
There is no collision marker for 1-way version. If you are that type and go back, you can activate the vault marker when you are on the plank.
  
  
Keep in mind that the plank is not the same level as the balcony, the wooden barrier you place your hands on is not perfectly even and pretty close to the surface. All this put together plus your character's race/height, the animation may look a bit off.
  
  
  
 ﻿?️ COMPATIBILITY
  
  
No existent record was edited by this mod. Only new ones added.
  
  
Any mod that does not drastically change the exact balcony where you get to the plank is fine. In other words, if a Valtheim Towers mod needs a patch for Leaps of Faith, it will probably need one for my mod as well. But I believe that any patch between Leaps of Faith and Valtheim Towers mod would already take into account for easier approach to the spot, leaving this mod kinda pointless for that setup.
  
  
Let LOOT to decide sorting.

 ﻿?️ INSTALLATION
  
  
Use a mod manager of choice. If not, put the ESP into your data folder. Have only one main file at a time. Should be good to switch from one to another.
  
  
Safe to add/subtract/multiply/divide - new/mid/end game. Just keep up with common senses and the best practices.
