**Q&A**
  
Q. Is there a certain percentage chance they reject?  Or is this a joke mod and they 100% reject?
  
A. It's the same as Immersive Rejection. There is no 'percentage chance'. If NPCs are marriageable and you meet the conditions for marriage, they won't reject anymore. **(Very Short) Video Showcase**
