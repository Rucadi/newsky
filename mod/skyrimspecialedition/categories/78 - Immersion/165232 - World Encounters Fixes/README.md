Most notable changes:
  
  
- Makes ["Thalmor vs Player"](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Justiciar_Execution_Order) encounter to start only after completing "Diplomatic Immunity" or "Missing In Action" quests.
  
 ﻿Notes: This one starts as soon as you hit level 8. Thalmor just want you dead without any actual reason. Now they will have good reasons.
  
  
- Makes "Farmer refuges after dragon attack" encounter to start after "Dragon Rising" quest.
  
 ﻿Notes: This one will start as soon as you hit level 4, no matter if there is any dragon out there. Also, immersion breaking when using mods that get rid of dragons, etc.
  
  
- Makes "Thief lockpicking" encounter independent of Thieves Guild questline.
  
 ﻿Notes: This one is about random thieves breaking into houses in Riften. Why was it locked behind TG quests? Makes no sense for me.
  
  
- Makes "Vampires vs Player Dawnguard" encounter to only start at night.
  
 ﻿Notes: In vanilla game this one can start during day-time. All other vampire encounters are set properly to start only at night. Fixed.
  
  
- Fixes missing condition in "Dawnguard Vampire Hunting" encounter, so it will properly start during night only.
  
  
- Unlocks werewolf encounters added by Dawnguard DLC.
  
 ﻿Notes: In vanilla these are locked behind Companions questline.
  
  
- Unlocks most other Dawnguard encounters (Vampires, Gargoyles, Death Hounds, etc.) from the start of the game.
  
 ﻿Notes: In vanilla they will play only after completing Dawnguard's intro mission. This had sense before Special Edition, when DLCs were separate entities.
  
Also, Durak says: *"You there. The Dawnguard is looking for anyone willing to fight against the growing vampire menace. What do you say?"* so it has sense to stumble upon some vampires before you start the Dawnguard DLC.
  
  
All other encounters from this mod can now play from the start of the game. More variety, more immersion, more challenge (some are tough for low level character!)
