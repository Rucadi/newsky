# Medieval Towers - Unique Civil War Forts
- Author: H Shirlock
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

**DESCRIPTION**
  
This mod places new tower turrets in Helgen and civil war quest forts. New assets were designed to fit seamlessly into the vanilla Imperial tileset and to fit into the general world of Skyrim. Inspiration was drawn from [Beyond Skyrim: Bruma](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10917) for the overall shape, although no assets were used without permission.
  
  
The goal is to increase the diversity of vanilla forts and landscape visuals via unique assets, to expand those locations in a compatibility-friendly way, and to help give more significance to capturing important forts during the civil war campaign. 
  
  
As shown in the first three screenshots, this mod only adds turrets to towers. This mod does not add battlements to forts on it's own. If you want turrets and battlements together, install the Medieval Castles patch from the optional files and also install [Imperial Castles of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/129327). This is intended as both a standalone forts enhancement mod and an addon to my previous forts mod, requiring minimal patches. I may make a merged version of all my fort mods in the future, if I ever run out of ideas ;)

**Meshes & Textures**Very slightly higher-poly meshes than vanilla and all using vanilla texture paths, so this should be extremely performance-friendly. Works with all texture replacers. Parallax and Complex Material meshes are available in the main download installer. Lod files for DynDOLOD users have also been included.
  
  
**New Interiors**Each tower turret has a complete interior room located in the game overworld (exterior). These turret rooms can be accessed through the same way the tower tops were in the vanilla game. Turret rooms atop previously inaccessible towers can be accesed by newly placed ladders and trapdoors.
  
  
**Compatibility**Compatible with pretty much everything. The only mods that need patches are those that move or edit the same towers as this mod adds turrets to. Texture overhauls, model replacers, clutter mods, and gameplay mods should be completely compatible. No navmesh edits were made.
  
  
What this mod actually does is add two new types of objects to the game: variant towers without battlements and variant tower turrets. This mod then disables individual vanilla towers at specific locations and places new versions. Only the locations covered by this mod will recieve tower turrets or require any patches for other fort-related mods.
