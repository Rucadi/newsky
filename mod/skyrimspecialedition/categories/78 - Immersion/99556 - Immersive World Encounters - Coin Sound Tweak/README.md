# Immersive World Encounters - Coin Sound Tweak

In the scene [size=3]"Adventurer Receives Reward from Steward" added by [Immersive World Encounters](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18330), when the money changes hands, the coin jingle sound that plays sounds like it's the player receiving the money rather than the NPC. This mod changes the sound so that it instead originates from the NPC. Should also apply to the same sound effect that plays during the various "Thief in town" scenes added by the mod.
