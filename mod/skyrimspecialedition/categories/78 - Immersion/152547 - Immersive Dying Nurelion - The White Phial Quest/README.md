**Description**

  
* After delivering the [broken White Phial](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_White_Phial_(item))﻿ to Nurelion in [The White Phial](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_White_Phial_(quest))﻿ quest, [Nurelion](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Nurelion)﻿ will go to his bed to sleep and die.
    
  [list]
If you try to interact with him at this point, the game will show a message box saying "Nurelion is asleep and dying."
  
* There will also be an error click sound that plays for non-interactive objects.

[\*]This mod replaces this with a more immersive experience:
  

* Nurelion will groan or cough when you're close or try to talk to him, like he is sick and dying.
The message box is now replaced with a notification.
  

[\*]5 lines of sick and dying dialog.
  
[\*]Includes [Sleeping Expanded](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59250)﻿ patch.
  
[\*]Works retroactively.
  
[\*]ESL.
  
[\*]Minimal changes: only message and dialog records are changed.
