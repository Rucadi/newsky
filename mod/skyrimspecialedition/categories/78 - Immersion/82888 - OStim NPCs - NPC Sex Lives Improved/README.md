**OStim NPCs - NPC Sex Lives Improved**

  
  
**READ the description carefully!** Below is, in detail, every piece of information regarding what this mod does, how it works, and how to make it work in your game. Failure to read the description will mean that this mod will not work when you boot up Skyrim. **I will not provide support if you don't read the description.**
  
  
**OStim NPCs** is a new OStim addon meant to give NPCs a sexual life, independent of the player character, in an immersive manner - it is **not** meant to turn your game into a massive orgy, but rather only start scenes when and where it makes sense. It is an improvement over ONights, OBetterNights and Eager Followers, as its scripts are much more lightweight, the MCM provides much more configuration options and many of the bugs that riddled those mods are not present in OStim NPCs. This mod is **ESP-FE**, so it will **NOT** take a slot in your load order!
  
  
OStim NPCs also takes advantage of the new features of OStim Standalone. NPCs will use furniture if you configure it that way in the MCM. NPCs are also properly tracked for excitement, which means they now actually orgasm, and the scenes end when they orgasm (note that regardless of this fact, OStim addons based on arousal and cum may not apply to NPC on NPC scenes). The NPC scenes also have AI, which means they will change animations dynamically, and always start with foreplay before moving on to penetrative sex!
  
  
This addon also adds a match maker spell! Aim the spell at two NPCs, and some seconds later they will start an OStim scene on the spot!
  
  
With this said, OStim NPCs is **INCOMPATIBLE** with ONights, OBetterNights and OStim Eager Followers. It is also meant to **completely replace them**. Those mods must be uninstalled if you have them in order to upgrade to OStim NPCs. Keep reading for more details on how to do this procedure.
  
  
For support regarding installation or troubleshooting, I highly suggest you join the [OStim Discord](http://discord.gg/RECvhVaRcU). It's much easier to provide help through the Discord channel than on Nexus.

So, Nazeem was doing his thing with his wife but when I was close enough to the bedroom, they stopped and then Nazeem just run naked like crazy.

**Installation guide**

  
  
Please read the installation guide carefully. **I WILL NOT PROVIDE SUPPORT IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW THIS GUIDE.**
  
  
**Step 0)** First off, OStim NPCs has several requirements. Make sure you get them first. Note that you must also install all the required mods of the mods listed below!
  
  
- [OStim Standalone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98163). Follow the [install guide](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/5654).
  
  
This mod won't work if OStim Standalone isn't installed properly. And no, this mod does NOT work with the old OStim. Don't ask.
  
  
You will also need to install the following mods:
  
  
- [PapyrusUtil](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13048)
  

* For Skyrim version 1.5.97, get version 3.9.
For Skyrim version 1.6.353, get version 4.3 under "Old Files".
  
* For Skyrim version 1.6.640, get version 4.4 under "Old Files".
For Skyrim version 1.6.1130, get version 4.5.
  
* For Skyrim from GOG, get PapyrusUtil GOG.

  
- [JContainers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16495)
  

* For Skyrim version 1.5.97, get version 4.1.13.
For Skyrim version 1.6.353, get version 4.2.2 under "Old Files".
  
* For Skyrim version 1.6.640, get version 4.2.3 under "Old Files".
For Skyrim version 1.6.1130, get version 4.2.8.
  
* For Skyrim from GOG, get version 4.2.6.

  
  
**Step 1)** This step is only needed if you have ONights, OBetterNights, OStim Eager Followers or **ANY** combination of these 3 mods installed.
  
  
**If you don't have any of these three mods installed, skip to Step 2).**
  
  
If you are going to start a new game, uninstall ONights, OBetterNights and OStim Eager Followers. Those 3 mods simply can't be in your load order to use OStim NPCs. After doing this, skip to **Step 2)**.
  
  
If you want to keep your current save (i.e. you are **not** starting a new game), the uninstall process of those mods requires more work, as detailed below:
  
  
--------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
**Step 1.1)** Backup your save. This should be obvious.
  
  
**Step 1.2)** Load your save. Open the console and type the following command:
  
  
> coc qasmoke

  
  
If done properly, this will put you in a test cell with several chests and no NPCs. Don't panic, we'll get out of here at the end of this process.
  
  
**Step 1.3)** If you have **ONights** installed, open the console and type the following command to terminate all scripts from ONights.
  
  
> StopQuest ONightsQuest

  
  
**Step 1.4)** If you have **OBetterNights** installed, open the console and type the following command to terminate all scripts from OBetterNights.
  
  
> StopQuest OBetterNightsQuest

  
  
**Step 1.5)** If you have **OStim Eager Followers** installed, open the console and type the following command to terminate all scripts from OStim Eager Followers.
  
  
> StopQuest OEFQuest

  
  
**Step 1.6)** Exit the console, save your game, and exit the game.
  
  
**Step 1.7)** Uninstall ONights, OBetterNights and OStim Eager Followers from your mod manager.
  
  
**Step 1.8)** Start Skyrim again and load the save. It will warn you about missing .esp plugins. This is normal. Continue with loading the save.
  
  
**Step 1.9)** In 99% of cases this step will not be needed - but **IF** you get save corrupted warning, exit the game again, reinstall ONights, OBetterNights and OStim Eager Followers, BUT disable their .esp plugins. In other words, the .esp plugins of those mods should be unticked, like the image below illustrates. This should allow you to load your save.
  
  
**If you don't get save corruption warning (you most likely won't!), skip to Step 1.10)**.
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/eDYD0CZ.png)
  
  
  
**Step 1.10)** With your save loaded, open the console and type the command:
  
  
> coc Riverwood

  
  
This will place your character in Riverwood. Run around for a couple of minutes, enter the store and the inn, etc. Save your game again, and exit the game.
  
  
**Step 1.11)** Load the save you just made in [Fallrim Tools ReSaver](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5031)﻿ and clean it (refer to ReSaver's mod page description to understand how to do this).
  
  
**Step 1.12)** If you still have ONights, OBetterNights and OStim Eager Followers installed but with the .esp plugin disabled, uninstall those 3 mods completely now from your mod manager.
  
  
**Step 1.13)** Your save is now clean. You may go to **Step 2)**.
  
  
--------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
**Step 2)** Install OStim NPCs with your favourite mod manager. Simply download and install as you would any other mod.
  
  
  
When you go ingame, give it a few minutes for the MCM to register. You will know OStim NPCs was installed properly if by opening the Spells menu and going to the Illusion spells tab, you will see the Match Making spells there.
  
  
This concludes the installation process for OStim NPCs.
  
  
  

**List of features**

  
  
- Scripts are much more lightweight than ONights and OBetterNights. The actor scan only runs at night time, and is completely inactive during the day. The performance impact is effectively zero even in large cities at night time.
  
  
- ONights and OBetterNights did all of the work in the same script. This means they could only set up one NPC scene at a time, and if the scene took a long time to set up, the main script would get stuck until all the work was done.
  
  
OStim NPCs gets rid of this problem by using a multithreaded approach:
  
  

  
* The main script only scans for the surrounding actors, picks only those that are valid to start an OStim scene and finds if there is any match between them. If there is, it then sends the scene setup to subthreads which will do the rest of the work. At this point, the main script goes to sleep until it's time to scan the surrounding actors again. This not only results in performance gains, but also in the ability of several scenes being able to be set up and started at once. A lot of care was also taken to avoid race conditions, so rest assured this system is pretty much immaculate.
After the actual scenes start, the subthreads continue to track their respective scenes to check if the NPCs are detecting you or not, and if the scene has ended to mark that subthread as no longer in use, in order for OStim NPCs to be able to use that subthread again to set up a new scene on it. This was impossible to do in ONights and OBetterNights, since they only had one main script doing all of the work, and therefore it couldn't keep proper track of all the scenes running.
  

  
- Extremely customisable through the MCM. You can pretty much configure every feature of this mod. Check the MCM screenshot on the images section! The [settings loader for OStim NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/83952) is also recommended if you want to keep your settings between different playthroughs.
  
  
- Includes a simple match making spell where you can select NPCs to have sex! The spell is under the Illusion spells menu. This spell can be removed from your character's spell list through the MCM if you don't want it.
  
  
- Through the minimum relationship setting in the MCM, Serana will no longer bang Nazeem out of the blue in Whiterun. With the default settings provided, OStim NPCs is extremely lore friendly and immersive. Scenes only start where and when it makes sense, between NPCs that actually match!
  
  
- NPCs will **NEVER** engage in incest. OStim NPCs checks for brother/sister, parent-son, parent-daughter and cousin relationships when match making NPCs. If any of those relationships are found, NPCs are **not** coupled. OStim NPCs is meant to be an immersive mod and to provide you a tasteful and wholesome experience.
  
  
- By default, NPCs will no longer start scenes in the middle of the street in towns, villages and hold capitals! They also won't start scenes in Guild Halls, such as the College of Winterhold or the Thieves Guild. You can also turn off scenes in inns if you wish. This is all configurable in the MCM.
  
  
- Followers can start scenes between themselves and with other NPCs. This can be adjusted in the MCM. For this to work however, the minimum relationship setting is ignored when match making a follower. The rules for follower matchmaking are the following:
  
  

  
* Each active follower is only looked for match making once every ingame hour.
Depending on your settings, it is determined randomly if the follower will start a scene with another follower, or if it will start a scene with a non-follower NPC.
  
* After this, a random chance determines if the follower will actually start engaging in an OStim scene or not with the potential partner he is being match made against.
All of your settings are respected regarding furniture, location, etc. The only setting that is ignored is the minimum relationship setting.
  
* Follower match making is automatically shut down if the maximum follower scenes for the current night have been reached.

  
This system makes follower match making more unpredictable and much more randomised. Followers will engage in scenes with different followers or NPCs each night, and in some nights, they might not engage in sex at all. Maybe sometimes they just don't feel up to it :)
  
  
- Followers will not have sex while you are in a dungeon, in order to not interrupt your adventure (configurable in the MCM).
  
  
- Enemies can engage in sex! While raiding a bandit camp, perhaps you will find them getting sweet on each other... the perfect time to strike since they are distracted, perhaps? Note that this feature has some limitations in order to balance gameplay, especially for stealth based characters. Otherwise, enemies would be constantly engaging in sex, making surprise attacks far too easy. The rules to decide if an enemy couple engages in an OStim scene are as follows:
  
  

  
* First of all, it obviously must be night time.
When your character enters a new location, it is determined randomly if you are going to see OStim scenes between enemies on it or not.
  
* If the RNG determines OStim scenes between enemies are not going to be started in your current location, then you're out of luck! Try again in the next location or in your next visit to this location.
If the RNG favours you, then you **might** see enemies engaged in an OStim scene. This will depend on if a matching couple is found, if you alert the enemies or not and if you don't kill them before they have the chance to set up the scene. Alerted enemies will not start OStim scenes!
  
* After a couple engages in a scene, no other enemies in that current location will engage in a scene for the remainder of your visit.
Enemy scenes are limited at 3 per night by default. You can adjust this in the MCM menu.
  

  
This creates a more unpredictable pattern of whether you'll see enemies engaging in sexual acts when you enter a dungeon, a cave or a fort. If you're very unlucky, you might spend a few nights without seeing enemies engaging in OStim scenes. The enemy scenes limit per night also ensures that stealth based characters don't have it too easy when sneaking through enemy filled locations. As you can see, OStim NPCs was also built with gameplay in mind, and to fit seamlessly into your Skyrim adventuring experience!
  
  
- By default, NPCs will stop the OStim scene if they detect you.
  
  
- You can set whether you want Elder Race NPCs (the old people) to engage in OStim scenes or not through the MCM.
  
  
- Built with OStim Standalone in mind and makes use of all its new features, including: furniture support, excitement tracking and AI for dynamic animation changing. Scenes start with foreplay before moving on to penetrative sex, and end when the NPCs orgasm. Note how fast the NPCs orgasm depend on your excitement multiplier in the main OStim NStandalone  MCM! If you want NPC scenes to last longer, decrease the excitement multiplier.
  
  
- NPCs will walk up to each other and travel to the furniture they detected before the OStim scene starts for incredible amounts of *immersion*. Please note that if the NPCs don't reach their destination within around 20 seconds, they will teleport to it in order for the scene setup to not get stuck. This shouldn't happen too often, so you won't see NPCs teleporting around in 99% of cases.
  
  
- You can set the distribution between FM, MM and FF scenes through the MCM. Note that if you don't have lesbian or gay animations installed, it is recommended to keep FF and MM scenes turned off.
  
  
- Built-in compatibility with [ORomance](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48564) and [ORomance Plus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81635). OStim NPCs detects if you have ORomance installed, and if an NPC is marked as a partner in ORomance or ORomance Plus, they will remain faithful and won't engage in scenes with other NPCs.
  
  
- Built-in compatibility with [OPrivacy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57013). OStim NPCs detects if you have OPrivacy installed, and if an NPC is approaching you or following you for privacy, they won't engage in scenes with other NPCs in order not to break OPrivacy.
  
  
- Married NPCs or NPCs that have a boyfriend/girlfriend will only start scenes with their lovers, even if you set the minimum relationship setting to its lowest value. This might change in a future update, check sticky post in the comments section for list of planned features for more details.
  
  
- With that said, NPCs that are marked as your husband/wife will also not engage in scenes with other NPCs. They remain faithful to you.
  
  
- OStim NPCs has all sorts of checks to guarantee that the NPC scenes which are started will not break any mechanic from the core game. These checks are mostly missing from ONights and OBetterNights, which caused them to have a lot of bugs that could prove to be very annoying for normal gameplay. OStim NPCs does the following checks to guarantee that your experience is very streamlined and bug free:
  
  

  
* If your character is in combat, NPC scenes won't be started in order not to break combat.
If an NPC is in combat, has his weapon drawn, is in a killmove, is bleeding or is in alert state/looking for you, he will not start sex scenes with other NPCs in order to not break his AI (and also because it wouldn't make sense to have sex in those situations...).
  
* If an NPC is being used by OPrivacy to approach or follow you, he will not start sex scenes with other NPCs.
If an NPC is an enemy, he will not start sex scenes with your followers or allies.
  
* If an NPC is attacked while in a sex scene, the scene ends immediately to allow combat to start properly.
If an NPC is in dialogue with you or is in a scene from a quest, that NPC will not start sex scenes with other NPCs in order not to break dialogue nor the quests they are involved in. Example: ONights and OBetterNights didn't check for this, so during the scene in Sovngarde where the warriors shout away Alduin's fog to combat him, they could start sex scenes between them, breaking completely the vanilla quest to kill Alduin.
  
* NPCs can only have sex once per night, in order to prevent them from constantly having sex while you are near them. In a future version, I might increase this limit and make it customisable.
  
  
  

**Frequently Asked Questions**

  
  
**1) How does this mod work, exactly? How are NPCs detected and chosen?**
  
  
The surroundings of your player character are scanned for NPCs at given intervals when it is night time (configurable in the MCM). Afterwards, it **filters out** invalid NPCs, such as children, those that are in combat, those that are dead, etc. We are then only left with adult NPCs who can actually start OStim scenes.
  
  
Afterwards, it is checked if the NPCs match according to your MCM settings. If a successful pair of NPCs is made, the dom actor will travel to the sub, invite him or her for sex, and if a furniture is available, they will both walk to that furniture. Afterwards, the OStim scene starts between them, and they have a good time. Simple and effective :)
  
  
This also means that, according to your MCM settings, you have to know where to look to find NPCs having sex. Don't expect this mod to turn the world of Skyrim into a rampant orgy. This mod tries to be immersive, and the NPCs will be by default very discreet about their privacy and sexual life, just as you would expect people to be in real life.
  
  
If you set NPCs to end the scene when they detect you, then you might want to level up that Sneak skill so they have a harder time finding you.
  
  
  
**2) Nothing works!**
  
  
You did not follow the installation guide properly or you have a wrong idea of how this mod works or what it's supposed to do. Read the description in its entirety.
  
  
  
**3) Aren't polling scripts bad? Is this going to ruin my save?**
  
  
Polling scripts are bad if they are done improperly and if they are attached to actors through cloaks.
  
  
The polling script in OStim NPCs is lightweight and uses for the most part native functions to do its checks. It is also not constantly running. It only runs at night, and even then, it runs only in intervals. The polling shuts itself down if it's day time, when you are in combat, when the concurrent scene limit has been reached, or when you are in an invalid location (such as the middle of the street in Whiterun, unless you set in the MCM for scenes to start there...). The script is also not attached to anything in the game, and it most certainly does **not** use script cloaks.
  
  
You can be assured that this mod was written with good modding practices in mind and will not fry your save under any circumstance.
  
  
In the rare circumstance this mod fries your save and causes a fire, please download and install [Bully My Squire](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81663) as it will put the fire out and restore your precious save.
  
  
  
**4) Won't removing ONights, OBetterNights and/or OStim Eager Followers midgame break my save?**
  
  
Adding mods midgame is completely fine (contrary to what many mod authors and load order zealots led you to believe), but removing mods midgame is another different thing entirely.
  
  
Yes, when removing mods midgame which have a plugin and scripts there is always a risk. However, this risk is largely mitigated by following the instructions I provided you in the install guide. By shutting off the scripts of those mods before uninstalling and cleaning your save will add an extra layer of security that will ensure that your save will not be broken.
  
  
As I said in the install guide, keep a backup of your save. Follow the install guide and then start playing with my mod installed. If after a few hours of playing you don't run into problems or CTDs related to the mods you removed, you will most likely not find any issues.
  
  
Of course, whether or not you want to take the risk, no matter how small it is, it's up to you. It's perfectly valid if you choose to wait to start a new playthrough before uninstalling ONights, OBetterNights and OStim Eager Followers to use OStim NPCs. It's your game, your load order, you do what you want.
  
  
Remember that, ultimately, Bethesda made Skyrim so that we would change our load order midgame. Skyrim's engine can handle load order changes very well. If that wasn't the case, Bethesda would have never released the DLCs and the Creation Club Content after the game's release, otherwise they'd break the saves of every Skyrim player :)
  
  
  
**5) Is this mod compatible with Scrappies Matchmaker?**
  
  
I didn't test it, but in theory it should be. Scrappies doesn't start scenes automatically, it requires your input, so it shouldn't compete with OStim NPCs.
  
  
ONights, OBetterNights and OStim Eager Followers **are FULLY INCOMPATIBLE!!!**
  
  
  
**6) Is this mod compatible with OCum Ascended, OAroused or OSL Aroused?**
  
  
It's compatible as far as it doesn't break if you have them. However, for example, arousal mods do not track NPC scenes and thus NPC scenes do nothing to those mods. This is not the responsibility of OStim NPCs. It is up to the authors of those mods to add NPC scene tracking and support.
  
  
[OCum Ascended](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77506) works with NPC scenes.
  
  
  
**7) Can you increase the limit of maximum scenes that can run at once?**
  
  
No. 4 is more than enough. Plus, that is half of how many scenes OStim itself can run concurrently. I leave the other half free so other OStim addons have breathing room if they need to start NPC scenes themselves.
  
  
Please, do not ask me to increase the maximum scene limit. I will not do it.
  
  
  
**8) Can you make this mod work with other frameworks?**
  
  
No, I only use and support OStim Standalone. Please do not ask me to port it to other frameworks.
  
  
You are free to do it yourself if you want to.
  
  
  
**9) Can you make this mod work with old OStim?**
  
  
No. This mod needs features that are only present in OStim Standalone to work properly.
  
  
I also don't have time to provide support for old mods that are no longer updated. Please don't ask.
  
  
  
**10) NPCs undress and redress instantly without any animation. What's wrong?**
  
  
Nothing is wrong. Currently, OStim Standalone does not support animated undressing and redressing for NPC scenes.
  
  
I know that enemies instantly redressing when the scene ends to charge at you can look a bit jarring, but there's nothing I can do until we add support for animated redressing in OStim Standalone itself for NPC scenes. You'll have to live with instant undressing/redressing without animations in the meantime.
  
  
  
**11) Can you add this and that feature?**
  
  
Probably yes, probably not. Feel free to ask or suggest features, I will deem if I can/want to do them or not.
  
  
Do not ask when they will be ready. They will be finished whenever I have the time to do so. Modding is not my job, and my personal life has priority over modding. Please respect that.
  
  
  
  

**I want to contribute to OStim NPCs code and features**

  
  
Please, be my guest. Me and the community will be grateful if you help fix bugs or implement new features. The Github link is below, feel free to fork the repository and make PRs if you change the code. I'll review, approve and merge them to release on the Nexus.
