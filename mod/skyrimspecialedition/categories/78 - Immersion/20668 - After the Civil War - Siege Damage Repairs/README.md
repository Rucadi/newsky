# After the Civil War - Siege Damage Repairs

**The mod can be installed anytime: before, during, or after the Civil War.**
  
  
The quest starts after the final siege and battle, when Ulfric or Tullius are dead and the war is over.
  
SpoilerYou'll be notified (not by the shrewd courier who managed to plant a GPS tracker in your undies... by the starting quest) that city repairs are planned. Donations are accepted in the Temple of the Divines in Solitude.
  
You may offer some gold to help fund and speed-up the reconstruction, or ignore the box and spend your beloved septims elsewhere.
  
The fundraising lasts two days and then, if you don't contribute (yup, it's a Dragonborn-centric world), they consider it a failure and the box is removed.
  
If you offer some gold, the box stays (locked... is there a key somewhere?... yes), and twenty-four hours later the gold is retrieved.
  
  
All the cities will be repaired and reverted to before-siege status: Solitude/Windhelm and Whiterun.
  
  
**Donation effects**
  
No donation -- Repair in about 20/21 days
  
5,000  --  15/16
  
10,000  --  10/11
  
15,000  --  5/6
  
Steal the donations (get back your gold plus some honest citizens' offers, and much shame)  --  30/31
  
  
**Quest start**
  
The quest is supposed to start two or three days after the end of the civil war, but only if you went away from Solitude or Windhelm after the battle.
  
Please don't get anxious, don't think about it, keep playing normally, do your stuff and the quest will start :)
  
  
**Quest completion**
  
The quest completes when entering any interior cell after the required time has expired.
  
  
**Optional add-ons**
  

  
* Enjia, an inconsequential tenant living in the repaired Heimskr's shack if and when he's jailed. She just stays around and pays the rent.
Nimriel inherits the repaired Pelagia's house and sleeps there.
  

  
**Patches**
  

  
* With the patch for "**Immersive Citizens**" Heimskr goes back to his rebuilt house instead of spending sleepless nights outdoors. If you don't care about Heimskr's well-being, you can safely disregard the patch.
The patches for "**Open Cities Skyrim**" and "**SR Exterior Cities**" are only for the repair crews. The repairs themselves always work, even without the patch.
  
* The patch for "**The Second Great War**" delays the quest start till after the end of the... second great war.
The patches for "**JK's Temple of the Divines**", "**HS Solitude - Temple of the Divines**", and "**Grand Solitude - The Walls of High King Erling**" move the box to a proper place.
  
* The patch for "**Enhanced Solitude**" reverts Vittoria Vici's house to vanilla so that it can have a 'destroyed' version after the siege.
A patch for "**YOT - Your Own Thoughts**" is [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/762)﻿.
  

**About the patches...**
  
If there are similar patches elsewhere, it goes without saying that only one should be used.
  
You choose which one.
  
  
**Globals**
  
If you wish to customize the repair timers, edit the global values in the esp, or make a patch, or change them with the console.
  
*No\_Gold*   (Default 492 game hours  --  Approx. 20/21 days)
  
*Five\_K\_Gold*   (336  --  15/16)
  
*Ten\_K\_Gold*   (216  --  10/11)
  
*Fifteen\_K\_Gold*   (96  --  5/6)
  
*Steal\_Gold*   (720  --  30/31)
  
**Change the values only before the start of the quest.**
  
The game-hour values don't match the actual days, they are approximations.
  
There is some fixed (script) and variable (how soon you interact with the box) time added.
  
There is also the randomness of how soon you enter an interior cell once the timer has expired (if you spend months just sitting beside your campfire and hunting rabbits.....) 
  
Anyway, by adding (or subtracting) ten hours, you get exactly ten more (or less) hours for the timer.

**Compatibility -- please read before posting**
  
The mod only checks whether Tullius or Ulfric are dead.
  
 **No ties, edits or changes to the Civil War at all.**
