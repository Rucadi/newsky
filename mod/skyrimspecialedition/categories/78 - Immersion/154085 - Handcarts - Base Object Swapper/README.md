Hi everyone!
  
  
This mod overhauls everyone's favorite cabbage carrier, the Skyrim handcart. There are six new variants that you'll see randomly (thanks to BOS) around Skyrim as you travel. They vary in detail from a very basic glow up to more complex handcarts. They're based on real-world examples. Check out the images in the gallery for more.
  
  
The mod can be used with other handcart retextures.
  
  
Installation:
  
  
1) Download and install [Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805). Endorse that mod! BOS handles the distribution of the handcarts.
  
2) Install this mod. If you use some of my other mods, you may be asked to overwrite them. That's all good, as these are just repeat textures. 
  
3) Enjoy!
