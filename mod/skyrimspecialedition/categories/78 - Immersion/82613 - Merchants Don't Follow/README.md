Pretty simple mod that I was surprised didn't exist.
  
  
If you are friends with a Merchant/ Shopkeeper (relationship rank of 1 or higher), you can traverse around their shop during working hours without them following you and keeping an eye on you.
  
  
  
I did some brief testing and it seems like it works.
  
  
ESL-flagged
