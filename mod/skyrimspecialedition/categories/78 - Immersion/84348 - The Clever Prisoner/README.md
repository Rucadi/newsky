**The Dumb Prisoner**
  
If the party is attacked by random enemies along the road, the unarmed and half-naked prisoner manages to untie himself and jumps in to help his captors, savagely snotting bandits, sabrecats and mammoths.
  
If the prisoner survives, he obligingly goes back to resume his 'role'.
  
  
If the player sets him free, the half-naked prisoner attacks his three full-armored, full-armed, full-magicked captors (Kill me! Kill me!)
  
  
  
**The Clever Prisoner**
  
If the party is attacked by random enemies, the prisoner takes advantage of the distraction, manages to untie himself and runs like hell.
  
If the guards win the fight, they pursue the escaping prisoner.
  
Of course, at the end of the fight the prisoner is usually quite far and safe (unless he gets stuck somewhere thanks to the amazing skyrimic navmeshes), but they give it a try.
  
  
If the player sets him free, the prisoner is very grateful and thinks "Maybe I should really help my saviour".
  
Then he has a better look at his three full-armored, full-armed, full-magicked captors and... runs like hell.
  
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
"**Truly Neutral Prisoners**" --- Patched.
  
"**Respect for the Legate**" --- Compatible.
  
"**Freed Prisoner Uses Items**" --- Preposterous.
  
"**Immersive World Encounters**" --- Better if not patched; load this after IWC.
  
"**Immersive Citizens**" --- Better if not patched; load this after IC.
  
"**Immersive Grannies**" --- Being looked at...Spoiler
  
I'm told that this is incompatible with some "**O-stuff**".
  
I can't even dare to imagine how such a thing might be possible; are the guards supposed to sodomize the prisoner?
  
Anyway, all the O-nanists are hereby warned, just in case.
