Not sure if this has been addressed in the past or not but, I can't stand when popping out from the shadows and sinking an arrow into the skull of an enemy and they mistake it for their imagination or they think they're just hearing things. So I fixed it.

They will continue to say if they have **NOT** taken damage
  
[color=#00ffff]Hmm. Nothing here after all.
  
Just getting jumpy I guess.
  
Must have been nothing
  
I guess I was just hearing things.
  
Must be my imagination
  
Mind's playing tricks on me...
  
I was sure I heard something.

Now what they will say if they have taken damage
  
Does this blood look like it's my imagination?
  
That bastard really hurt me.
  
How do you just disappear in thin air?
  
Damn it! I'm bleeding!
  
I was attacked!
  
I've been hit!
  
Someone is here!
  
Stop hiding coward!
  
I feel light headed.
  
  
They will continue to say if they have **NOT** killed the player.
  
Cleared out, I guess.
  
Oh well. Must have run off.
  
No sign of 'em
  
Must've scared 'em off.
  
  
Now what they will say if they kill the player.
  
Simply weak!
  
No contest!
  
You loser!
  
You're nothing!
  
Truly pathetic!
