A simple upgrade for Red Mountain Plume. Improved mesh, shaders, textures. Seven versions to choose from. Three texture resolutions, 2K, 1K and 512px. Take a look at the screenshots, everything will become clear. Plume now reacts to sunlight, is more three-dimensional.
  
  
  
  
**Reminder:**
  

  
The visibility of Red Mountain Plume depends on the fog settings in the weather records. It also depends on the environmental fog settings in ENB, especially the "FogAmountMultiplier" value.
  
If the fog is too dense, then only the silhouette of Red Mountain can be seen. So a lot depends on the weather mod you use as well as the ENB preset, if you use any.
  
  
Should be compatiblebline with [Red Mountain Plume Visible from Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66048)
  
  
There is also a mods that add lava to Red Mountain, it may come in handy:
