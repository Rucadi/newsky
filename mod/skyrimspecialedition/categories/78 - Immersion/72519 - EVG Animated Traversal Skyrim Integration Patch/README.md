# EVG Animated Traversal Skyrim Integration Patch
- Author: kuroishitam
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

**Even when there is already Skyclimb mod, this mod is not at all replaced because this mod adds more than climbing and vaulting over marker which skyclimb already covers.**
  
  
Do you have any experience while playing skyrim, you see some cliff and you want to get up there but you can't?
  
  
Well, now you can do that, at least in some places included in this mod. Big thanks to Everglaid's [EVG Animated Traversal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63232) and Maleficus' [MCM EVGAT Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71319), i have added more than two hundreds EVGAT markers (mostly climb markers) to almost all Skyrim and Solstheim dungeons. I have also added some other EVGAT markers to give you alternative to access certain places. You can see some examples of markers added in the pictures provided.
  
  
All markers are marked with small light indicator toggleable using Maleficus MCM framework, so you can turn on/off whenever you want. It takes a few seconds to turn on/off the light indicators, due to script loading.
  
  
This mod was made with [mfvicli's EVGAT Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70635?tab=description) in mind, so i didn't add markers to most locations already covered by him. I added markers to 109 vanilla locations and his mod added markers to 72 locations (as for version 1.2.1) for a total of 168 vanilla locations (minus 13 because I edited the same places as his mod but no conflict). Combine my mod with his mod to give you full experience of EVGAT mod while exploring Skyrim!
  
Should also be compatible with [EVG Traversal Animations - Dungeons addons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71504) v1.3.
  
  
**UPDATE 9/9/22:** I have made a patch to resolve overlapping markers for Mfvicli EVGAT Patch AIO ver. 1.2.8, i will not update the patch for version higher than that since that mod won't be an ESPFE anymore as for 1.2.9 onwards.
  
  
**INFO UPDATE**:
  
Use [powerofthree's Tweak 1.7](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51073) update to enable use markers in combat, big kudos to him!
