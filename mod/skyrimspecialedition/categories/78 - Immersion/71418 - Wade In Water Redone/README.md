# Wade In Water Redone
- Author: doodlum
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71418
**OVERVIEW**
  
  
**Remade and enhanced Loki's Wade In Water which slows actors in water at an engine level, with support for SSE and AE in one DLL.**
  
  
This mod is functionally equivalent but with smooth transitions between different states, implementing slowing at an engine level rather than via spells.

**NOTES**
  

  
* Not compatible with VR unless Bug Fixes is ported.
The original magic effects are left intact only for DAR animations to function properly. The included plugin neutralises the slowness effect.
  
* Modifications to the original mod's plugin will have the same effect on this mod.
