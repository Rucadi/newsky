# Civil War Battlefields
- Author: Ceftadzime

Overview:
  
This mod adds past battlefields around Skyrim to give a more realistic feeling that a civil war is happening in the country. 
  
  
New Battlefields:
  
Most Battlefields have been reworked, and the remaining ones have been integrated into the time system that keeps track of when battlefields change.
  
  
Dynamic Battlefields:
  
As time goes on, battlefields will change. Fires will go out, bodies and loot will disappear, and some battles will not appear until you progress through the civil war.
  
  
Unique Battles:
  
Most battle sites will have unique flairs, be it occupied by bandits looting for gear, animals consuming the dead, wounded soldiers left behind, or just the quiet remains of bygone battles.
  
  
Massive thanks to DeviantKaled for the [Ships and Boats of Tamriel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41653?tab=description) and Jebbalon for the [Hanged Man Corrected Scripts](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22047?tab=description). These mods have made the mod better than I could have done on my own.
