**[LE Version﻿](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/112570)﻿

  
Mod Description**
  
  
In vanilla Skyrim the torches last for 4 minutes while equipped, after which they will burn out and the torch is lost. However there is an exploit where you can unequip the torch before the duration runs out and reequip it to reset the timer, and therefore use the torch indefinitely.
  
  
This mod aims to prevent this by setting a longer duration on the torch, and remembering how much time has passed since using the torch even if you unequip and reequip. On reaching the torch's duration it will burn out and be removed from your inventory. This encourages players to find more torches, or preferably use a mod which allows you to craft torches.
  
  
**Features**
  
  

  
* Remembers how long the torch has been used even on relaunching the game
30 minutes or 1 hour (real time) torch duration options are available
  
* Notification message saying how long in minutes is left on the torch, upon equipping or unequipping
Lightweight mod, a single script that triggers once only when the player equips or unequips a torch
  
* Game timescale will not affect duration, it will always be 1 hour or 30 minutes real time

**Compatibility**
  
  
Any mod which changes the record of 0001D4EC Torch01 is incompatible, load this mod under any mod which does so, or simply patch it in SSEEdit. However if the mod(s) that are conflicting extends the duration of the torch longer than 1 hour, then it is compatible no matter the load order.
  
  
**Recommended Mods**
  
Any mod which allows you to craft torches.
