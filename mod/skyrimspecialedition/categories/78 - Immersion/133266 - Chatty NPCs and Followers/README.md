# Chatty NPCs and Followers

This mod aims to breathe new life into Skyrim by introducing three elements into everyday events in the following ways.
  
  

  
* NPCs will approach each other in exterior cells and greet each other
NPCs will approach each other in interior cells and inquire about the other one's health
  
* NPCs will approach vanilla voiced followers with a greeting, a blessing or something to annoy them.

  
**Element 1 - Outdoor Greetings**
  
While outdoors, in cities and towns, there will be a random chance of two NPCs having a short conversation. Mostly, it will just be a basic greeting but sometimes they'll mention the weather or something else. Responses and approaches will differ based on race, gender and the relationship between the NPCs. For instance a child might respond differently to their parent, or a spouse to their partner.
  
  
In some cases the NPC might respond with an insult or racist comment, for example Rolff or Elda won't like it if a Dark Elf (or any non-Nord for that matter) approaches them. Some NPCs may just sound irritated and not want to talk.
  
  
NPCs might respond differently to drunks and beggars. Sometimes they might not have much to say and just grunt. Some unique NPCs have their own unique lines too. All greetings and responses are random so you will see some variety in the conversations. If the response is particularly nasty, other nearby NPCs might respond.
  
  
Current followers won't be involved in this element of the mod.
  
  
The conversation will only trigger if both NPCs are fairly close to the player to avoid interrupting quests and vanilla scenes.
  
  
**Element 2 - Indoor Conversations About Health**
  
  
In interior cells, there will be a random chance of an NPC approaching another and asking about their health with a random question. The other NPC will respond randomly, either saying they feel well, feel ill, or something indifferent. Sometimes they'll just tell the other one to go away or mind their own business. The approaching NPC will then randomly respond with an appropriate comment.
  
  
Sometimes the responder will just cough or say they have something nasty and nearby NPCs will react accordingly.
  
  
Current followers won't be involved in this element of the mod.
  
  
The conversation will only trigger if both NPCs are fairly close to the player to avoid interrupting quests and vanilla scenes.
  
  
**Element 3 - NPCs Approach Your Followers**
  
  
Have you ever noticed that your followers sometimes seem invisible and nobody notices they're even with you? Well, not any more, this element causes NPCs to approach your follower (vanilla voiced followers only) and do one of the following;
  
  
**Give Them a Blessing -** the NPC will give them a random blessing and the follower will thank them.
  
  
**Greet Them -** the NPC will say hello or something similar and the follower will respond to them.
  
  
**Annoy Them** - the NPC will either ask them an annoying question, say something unkind or just downright insult them. In some cases the comments will be racist (in line with in-game racism). For example Rollf will tell a Dunmer they're a filthy Gray-Skin or tell them to get out of the city. The follower will respond accordingly and if you have more than one vanilla voiced follower, they will also be outraged.
  
  
There's also a 50% chance that a random NPC will approach your follower when you enter a shop or an inn.
  
  
Each element can be toggled on or off in the MCM.
  
  
There are nearly 1500 lines of dialogue so you can expect to see a good variety of conversations. All lines are either repurposed vanilla lines or spliced from original lines. No voice cloning has been used for this mod.
  
  
I've tried my best to exclude some NPCs from talking to others based on their personality or attitude towards certain races, but I've probably missed some out. Feel free to bring them up and this *may* be addressed in a future update.
  
  
**Installation**
  
Simply install like you would any other mod using your favourite mod manager. Should be safe to install mid-game.
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
Should be compatible with pretty much anything. It's been tested with [Realistic Conversations](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1717) with no issues.
  
  
**FAQs / Comments**
  
The mod is ESL flagged so it won't take up a spot in your load order. It has been cleaned and checked for errors in xEdit.
  
  
**LE version?**
  
Yes, backported by Markus79 - [LE Version](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/119311)
  
  
**Does it work with AE?**
  
The mod was made with the older version of the Creation Kit so it's compatible with all versions of Skyrim SE/AE.
  
  
**Does it work with town mods or other mods that add new NPCs?**It will work with any mod that adds NPCs with **vanilla voice types**, including followers. It will not work with any NPC that has a custom voice type.
  
  
**Does it work with follower frameworks?**It works with Nether's Follower Framework. It has not been tested with other follower frameworks. If they use a different method of adding followers other than using the vanilla framework, this may cause issues.
  
  
**How often are the comments?**There's a random chance with various cooldowns. NPC - NPC greetings has a 3 hour cooldown. NPC - NPC health comments has a cooldown of 6 hours. NPC to follower comments has a cooldown of 6 hours. This doesn't mean you'll hear a comment every 'x' hours. It simply means there's a *chance* for it to happen every 'x' hours.
  
  
**What are the vanilla voice types for followers?**Spoiler
  

  
* Female Condescending
