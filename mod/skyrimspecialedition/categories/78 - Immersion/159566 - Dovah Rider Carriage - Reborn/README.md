**Overview**
  
*Dovah Rider Carriage – Reborn* transforms Skyrim’s travel by letting you drive your own horse-drawn carriage anywhere. 
  
Stop to camp, bring followers, haul gear, and enjoy immersive road trips instead of fast travel. Drive the carriage, or allow skyrim Ai system to take the controls with Auto-Pilot. Choose from over 100 destinations to ride to & drive your carriage the way Bethesda would've wanted it to be.

**Q: How do I summon the carriage?**
  
A: Use the included *Command Spell* to summon or dismiss your carriage at any time.
  
  
**Q: Can followers ride in the carriage?**
  
A: Yes. Followers can ride along in the carriage this is a experimental feature, & the carriage might behave in unexpected ways, regarding collision & havok. Also your followers can relax at camp using the sandbox system.
  
  
**Q: Does this mod replace vanilla carriages?**
  
A: No. Skyrim’s vanilla carriage system is untouched. This mod is a completely new, drivable carriage system.

A: Yes. The camp system is designed to work seamlessly with survival frameworks.

A: Use the *Skip Auto Travel* option to teleport straight to your selected destination.
  
  
**Q: Will this mod cause save bloat?**
  
A: No. The system uses safe cleanup routines to remove old camp objects and prevent clutter buildup. I have taken every step possible to make this a safe mod.
  
  
**Q: My lights aren’t turning on/off correctly?**
  
A: Make sure you are using the auto-light feature. Lights will adjust automatically based on time of day.
