# Sa'chil - No Book and Spell on Start

When the game starts, the quest which adds the book and the spell starts too. I made this mod for myself at first, but I imagine I might be not the only one who hates when mods do such things by littering the inventory and magic menu. So, there we are. It simply removes the "starts on game run" flag from the quest. Thus, it simply never runs and doesn't add anything. Also marks the book and spells as "Deleted" to make sure of their non-existence.
