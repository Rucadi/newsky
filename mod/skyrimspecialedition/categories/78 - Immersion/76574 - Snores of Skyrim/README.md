# Snores of Skyrim

A mod to add snoring to NPCs when they're asleep. Most vanilla voice types are covered and each has their own unique snoring sound. The mod is script free and very lightweight and should be compatible with pretty much anything. 
  
  
The snoring is designed to fire randomly and only when the player is within a certain range so you won't hear it all the time. It will work with mod-added NPCs as long as they use one of the vanilla voice types included in this mod.
  
  
**Potential Issues:**
  
It's possible that if you wake an NPC mid-snore and they have no dialogue when they're awoken, the snore sound may continue playing, but I would recommend [Jayserpa's Sleeping Extended](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59250) which will prevent this.
  
  
There's a very rare vanilla bug with new dialogue not firing after installing a mod. If you don't hear any snoring, just make a save and load it which should fix this if you encounter it.
  
  
**Questions and Observations:**The lip-sync doesn't quite match - no it doesn't, but it's the best I could do.
  
  
The NPCs eyes flicker when they snore - yes they do, again, best I could do. Put it down to them being in REM sleep.
  
  
ESL? - yes
