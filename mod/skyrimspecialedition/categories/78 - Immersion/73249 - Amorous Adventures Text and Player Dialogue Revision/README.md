[font=Arial]Description[/font][font=Arial]
  
This mod revises the text and player dialogue in [Amorous Adventures 3.4 SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7305). All playable content is covered. It *should* be compatible with other variants of AA ([FlowerGirls](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5941?tab=files&file_id=62037&nmm=1), [OStim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48912)/[Osex](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61397)). Not compatible with [Amorous Adventures Plus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39163). It is an .esl-flagged .esp.[/font][font=Arial]

Philosophy and Changes Made**DISCLAIMER**: The following section contains my personal opinions and is not meant to be taken as objective criticism.
  
  
Amorous Adventures has a great foundation for expanding on characters, giving them personalities, and introducing romantic storylines for the Dragonborn. I'm a fan of the concepts that [Foxfingers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/9749451)﻿ came up with. Personally, I find the writing to be too silly and unrefined, to a point where it detracts from the quality of the storytelling and limits the applicability of the writing to a variety of characters. Changing the questline structures or NPC spoken dialogue is beyond me, but I revised all player dialogue and text (books/notes, message boxes, spell/NPC/item names). Here is a sample video:
  
  
  
  
Changes are outlined below:
  
**General**
  
[/size][/font]

  
* [font=Arial]Fixed grammar (capitalization, missing punctuation), revised wording for better read quality, removed immersion breaking lines (real-world references, modern sounding verbiage, overly pornographic statements)[/font]
[font=Arial]Removed all instances of "Sex Magic", replaced with general references to spells of a sexual nature, renamed "Circle of Sex" spell and effect to "Carnal Circle"[/font]
  
* [font=Arial]Renamed "East Empire Company papers" to "East Empire Company Documents"[/font]

[font=Arial]**Revised Books and Notes**[/font][font=Arial]
  
[/font]

  
* [font=Arial]Uniformly formatted names[/font]
[font=Arial]Edited the Reachman song, made it rhyme and flow better[/font]
  
* [font=Arial]Renamed "Secrets of Telvanni Sex Magic" to "Secrets of Sensual Magic",[/font][font=Arial] changed the author's name to a lore-friendly dunmer name, completely [/font][font=Arial]rewrote the text - These two books were awful, filled with cringy writing and references. There was no salvaging them, I cut everything and wrote some brief lines that sound like they belong in a magic tome and provide the necessary information.[/font]

[font=Arial]**Revised Player Dialogue**[/font]

  
* [font=Arial]No more "milady"-type stuff. I'm not sorry, fedoras.[/font]
[font=Arial]Tried to eliminate cringe content - I can't think of a better way to describe this. All writing that was[/font][font=Arial] trying too hard to be funny or witty, too much of a bad porno script, [/font][font=Arial]too cheesy or corny, I squashed it[/font][font=Arial].[/font]
  
* [font=Arial]Focus on neutral tone - I tried to make the player dialogue line up better with the base[/font][font=Arial] game, i.e. more neutral. As a bonus, this makes it easier to roleplay, [/font][font=Arial]as you can choose to interpret a line as sarcastic, or serious, or [/font][font=Arial]earnest, or however you want to imagine it sounding.[/font]
[font=Arial]Toned down the flirting - This is related to neutralization, but especially important for "romance". The player character was often hitting on the love interest constantly from the start, well before they reciprocate. I took that out and tried to make it build towards intimacy.[/font]
  

[font=Arial]**Renamed NPCs**[/font][font=Arial]
  
[/font]

  
* [font=Arial]Ridiculous Forsworn and Falmer enemy names changed to match vanilla conventions while remaining unique[/font]

[font=Arial]**Revised Message Box Text**[/font]

  
* [font=Arial]More succinct, less over-the-top[/font]

[font=Arial]
  
Unfortunately, this version does not include edits to the quest journal entries, i.e. text that appears in the quests menu. The LoversLab version does, but including these changes adds SexLab as a master, making it incompatible with other AA variants.
  
  
Please note that this mod is a seperate plugin and *not* a replacer for the original.[/font][font=Arial]
  
  
If you don't like my changes, [Amorous Adventures - Player Dialogue Rewritten](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38989) is an alternative to consider.
  
  
[font=Arial][size=3]**Optional File**[/font]**: [font=Arial]Elisif Quest Starter Dialogue Only in Blue Palace[/font]**
  
This file will make the dialogue that starts the Elisif quest only appear on NPCs inside the Blue Palace. Without it, the dialogue appears on every NPC in the Solitude area. Main file is not required, but this must be loaded after the main file if you use it. It is an .esl-flagged .esp. Made based on a request by throwaway219 on LoversLab.
