**[font=Tahoma]Regional Merchants - Stalls of Skyrim[/font]**
  
  
Adds **23 new merchant stalls** with **10 clothing merchants** (one in each hold capital + Raven Rock) and **13 local artisans** to the game, integrating local economies, clothing styles, mod-added clothing, and some mod-added light armor. Regional Merchants 1.0 features **117 different mostly lore-friendly or lore-adjacent clothing and accessory mods** using [SkyPatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106659)﻿ to inject them into my leveled lists. If you have the mod, the clothes will appear in my merchants' inventories (specifically, the 9 clothing merchants in the hold capitals + the lady in Raven Rock). If you do not have a mod, its ini file will get skipped and its contents will not appear. New mods can easily be added in on request, or added yourself! Instructions are in a stickied discussion post.
  
  
  
**[font=Tahoma]Clothing Merchants[/font]**- **10 new clothing merchants**, one in each hold, with inventories that match the climate and economy of their hold.
  
 - - **Halsteg** (Markarth by the mines) - Runs a Silverblood company store, providing clothing and gear for the miners.
  
 - - **Marise Julentia** (Falkreath main road) - Caters to mourners come to visit Falkreath's cemetery.
  
 - - **Gaernyval** (Solitude by the Bards College) - Sells fine clothes and musical instruments.
  
 - - **Kadlin** (Whiterun entrance road). - Caters to the farmers and citizens of Whiterun.
  
 - - **Svanlaugh** (Windhelm by Candlehearth Hall) - Caters to the farmers and citizens of Windhelm.
  
 - - **Lumana** (Riften Market) - Has some fine imported Redguard outfits
  
 - - **Merende** (Morthal Moorside Inn) - Though her shop is smaller than her cousins Taarie and Endarie's, she has a wide selection of finery.
  
 - - **Gulov Bear-Kin** (Winterhold Frozen Hearth) - Gulov kills most of the animals himself that he sources his furs from.
  
 - - **Estra Broken-Oar** (Dawnstar Windpeak Inn) - Her seafaring life long over due to an unfortunate shipwreck, Estra now plies the tailor trade.
  
 - - **Saebil Ramoran** (Raven Rock Market) - Offers Dunmer clothing and other imported specialties.
  
  
 - - Inventories are randomized, using leveled lists. Their selection changes so come back and visit them later if you want to see if they have anything different!
  
 - - Using only vanilla assets as actual stealable items was a design choice to enable rogue/thief gameplay styles - even though this means there might be a Havok bounce here or there, and that I couldn't pack things in as tightly as I could have with static objects.

**[font=Tahoma]Local Merchants
  
[/font]**- **13 new local artisans**, one in each town or village (and a few by the roadside)
  
 - - Each local merchant represents a local artisan craft, and has corresponding wares
  
 - - **Danikke** offers you fine hides at the North-Western edge of Rorikstead
  
 - - **Ragzak gro-Yamarrz**, turned out of the longhouse at 19 with no meaningful skills, makes a living in Karthwasten crafting spoons and plates.
  
 - - **Ruskold** tends his pottery kiln at Stonehills to provide authentic local nordic crafts.
  
 - - **Vilda the Weaver** sells baskets at Dragon Bridge. Surely there's nothing more to her than meets the eye.
  
 - - **Neisi the Witch** runs a modest apothecary stall at Kynesgrove.
  
 - - **Beljorm** makes pots and pans at Darkwater Crossing.
  
 - - **Kyendra** is an accomplished hunter, and offers her products at the roadside at Shor's Stone.
  
 - - **Merja Tarnswept** offers supplies to pilgrims seeking to climb the 7000 steps to High Hrothgar.
  
 - - **Kelec Vendrethis** has a small selection of trinkets and products at Tel Mithryn.
  
 - - **Taamir** resides at the roadside Shrine of Dibella in the Reach, both protecting the local hunters and offering goods to passing travelers.
  
 - - **Bellenda Palentia** operates a cheese and soup stall on the road East of Whiterun, just across from the Tundra Homestead. She'll happily buy your useless junk if you have any to sell her.

**[font=Tahoma]Merchant Stalls
  
[/font]**- **23 merchant stalls** that highlight local goods, clothes, and wares.
  
 - - **Pottery Kilns** in Riverwood and Stonehills! It was just as easy for me to add a functional kiln as a dummy one for the artisan to use, so enjoy cup and bowl making if you so wish.
  
 - - I kept the objects as in-game misc/clothing objects rather than statics, meaning if you want to be a jerk you can **steal from my merchants**.

**[font=Tahoma]Mod Added Clothing[/font]**
  
  
**Adds 117 mods with clothing, light armor, accessories to the leveled lists of these merchants if you have SkyPatcher**. It's automatic! I did all the work, you don't need to do anything other than:
  
 - - Install Skypatcher and this mod
  
 - - Watch your mod clothes appear on the clothing vendors!
  
 - - Uninstall/Reinstall safe, using SKSE rather than scripting
  
 - - If you DO NOT have a mod included in the .ini files, it'll just get skipped!
  
 - - If you DO have a mod included in the .ini files, its content will get added to my merchants.
  
 - - Request your own armor mod injection by leaving a comment on the Nexus Page!
  
 - - I will fill requests that are lore-adjacent or lore-friendly, and not TOO skimpy (I'll be making another mod for that).
  
 - - Light Armor mods were selected for inclusion if the "Light Armor" looked like clothing.
  
 - - Does not add to, remove from, touch, or alter ANY vanilla leveled list, merchant inventory, NPC, or container.
  
 - - A couple of my favorite bodysuits and high heel mods. I couldn't help myself. If you don't have them installed, they won't show up anywhere!
  
 - - All stats, armor values, clothing/armor categories, slot usage, weights, armor properties, and gold values are entirely up to the mod author of the respective clothing, armor, or accessory mods. I made no changes.

You will need to ***make your own patch*** for City Trees, as that mod has a tremendous number of .esp files that would require potentially hundreds of patch combinations. Patch it for your load order and specific combination, if you use it.
  
  
I am having issues getting assets to load from Capital Windhelm Expansion even with CK set to load its bsa, so anyone who wishes to make a patch for that, please do so. I have open permissions.
  
  
  
**[font=Tahoma]Frequently Asked Questions
  
[/font]**
  
 - - I installed this with Regional Outfitters / Socalista Winterhold / Socalista Resources / <insert other of my mods> and my mod manager says there's a conflict.
  
 - - - *There is no conflict, these mods just contain identical files - it doesn't matter what order you load them in or which you set to override the others. I did it this way so that you can save on hard drive / file space usage, rather than making each of my mods use separate paths for shared files.*
  
  
 - - Is this mod compatible with x?
  
 - - - *The only incompatibilities will be with clipping/markers. No navmeshes, leveled lists, NPCs, landscapes were changed by this mod.
  
  
 - -*Can this mod be added/removed mid playthrough? Can I add/remove x clothing mod supported by this framework mid playthrough?
  
 - - - *Actually, yes. That's why I use SKSE injection rather than scripted additions to the new leveled lists. Worst case scenario is that three merchants in interior cells might not appear if you add this mod mid playthrough, then add patches for this mod regarding those specific locations mid playthrough that move the merchant placement (none such patches exist as of yet).*
  
  
 - - How can I add more clothing/jewelry? How can I make this support x mod? How can I add more merchants to this?
  
 - - - *See stickied discussion posts with instructions.* - - What if I have a different version of a clothing/jewelry mod?
  
 - - - *If the name is the exact same, it'll work just fine. If the NAME changed, rename the appropriate ini file accordingly, such as from "Armor Mod.esp" to "Armor Mod My Fixes.esp"* - - What if I made the armor mod into an esp-fe/esl file?
  
 - - - *Most of my ini files reference EditorIDs, so it should work just fine. If it was changed to an actual ESL not just ESP-FE you'll need to rename the ini file from "Armor Mod.esp" to "Armor Mod.esl"* - - What if I combined x, y, and z armor mods into a bigger pack?
  
 - - - *Take the ini files for x, y, and z armor mods copy/paste all the contents into a new ini file named "Your Combined Pack.esp". Feel free to copy/paste one of the files from this mod as a template, then just rename it / paste over what is in it. This assumes you did not change the EditorIDs. If you did, you'll need to change those in the new ini as well.*
  
  
  
All NPCs use whatever textures and body shapes you have installed.
  
  
This mod was created with the 1.640 version of the Creation Kit so is compatible with all SE/AE versions of Skyrim. It is ESP-FE flagged. It is safe to install and uninstall mid-game, unless you use another mod on the NPCs that attach scripts to them. This mod has no running scripts or quests.
  
  
No assets from any clothing or armor mods were included. There are no .esp plugin dependencies on ANY clothing or armor mods.
