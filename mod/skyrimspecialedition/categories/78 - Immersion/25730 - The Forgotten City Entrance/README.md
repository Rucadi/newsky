I love [The Forgotten City](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1179) and I can only think of one thing which did not do it for me...The entrance. Any Tom walking across the bridge would see the 'in the day' docks walkway. Hell, even I would have walked up to have a look!
  
  
So the Forgotten City would be heaving with trade one would have thought? Not so forgotten, which ruins the immersive aspect of the mod for me.
  
So with respect, I give you a new entrance befitting the Forgotten City.  A simple and clean mod for immersive pleasure.
