Poor Grelka. She's gone all over Skyrim selling these bits of junk, and she's barely scraping by. But what if she managed to get a few rare pieces in?
  
  
Also, what if you, the player, wants some new modded armour but doesn't want to level up Smithing to ebony level or similar to be able to craft it? Why not just... buy the armour from Grelka?
  
  
WHAT IT DOES
  
  
This mod enables Grelka to sell great modded armours from authors including Obicnii, ContentCat, ChakraSSE, Ellxe, AokiliMods and veracruze!  All are optional - use the FOMOD installer to choose just one or however many you like. See the Requirements dropdown for the list of available armours.
  
  
The armour item inclusion is unlevelled, so high-level armours will be available early. However the price will anyway be out of reach for lower level players.
  
  
Some economy mods may play havoc with the pricing, making the pieces way too expensive. Therefore there is an optional price reduction patch included, which reduces the price by 35 or 50%. 
  
  
I may update this with some new armours in the future.
  
  
REQUIREMENTS:
  
1. Skypatcher
  
2. Original mod for whichever armours you'd like Grelka to sell. 
  
  
Load order doesn't matter.
  
100% of DP goes to charity.
