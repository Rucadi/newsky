# Sit on Stuff

**Description**
  
  

  
* This mod allows you to sit on some predefined objects in hunter, bandit, forsworn and other camps where only NPCs could sit before.
They behave like normal furniture - just activate an object to sit on it.
  
* Currently only covers objects that are intended for sitting. Stumps, landscape and random objects aren't covered.
Edits specific object instances, not all objects of some type.
  
* 26 specific objects in total at the moment (you can suggest more to me): 13 "stumps" (chopping blocks), 1 rock, 2 crates and 10 cut logs.
Technically this mod uses existing invisible sitting markers that NPCs use (i only placed one myself where the existing one couldn't be used). It replaces static objects with activators that pass the activation to the closest invisible sitting marker.
  

**Requirements**
  
  

  
* [Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805)﻿
(Recommendation) [Skyrim Landscape and Water Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26138) fixes issues with some of the modified objects
  

**Compatibility**
  
  

  
* This mod is highly compatible thanks to Base Object Swapper. Load order doesn't matter.
If some mod redirects any of the base objects to a different mesh (by a different path), the specific objects touched by this mod won't be affected. A patch can be made by editing the mesh path of the Activator object from this mod. Normal mesh and texture replacers are compatible. A patch for [Sitting on Sensible Stumps AKA Suitable Stumps of Skyrim BOS](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/159470)﻿ is available.
  
* A consistency patch for [Take a Nap - Sleep on Chairs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/113255)﻿ is available. This patch allows to sleep on the objects modified by Sit on Stuff, which aren't supported by Take a Nap without this patch because [size=2] technically they're not furniture.[/size]
