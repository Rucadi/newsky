~VAMPIRE LINES EXPANSION~

  
With this mod, Vampires will have access to more lines. By adding around 150 new lines that are not shared between voice types, the members of this factions will feel more unique and have more to say. Lines are always attached to conditions, so they will only come up in relevant scenarios, making the NPCs seem more alive than ever before.
  
  
Focus this time is on vampires, but some of the new lines apply to other factions too (Warlocks/Necromancers/Dawnguard...) and sometimes also to anyone using the same voice types. This means that NOT only vampires will benefit from having this mod installed.
  
  
The optional file for orcs will restore orc vampires. Bethesda recorded vampire lines for orcs, but then didn't add any vampire orcs to the enemy spawning lists. As it stands, there's only one vampire orc in the entire game that could use the orc vampire lines. To fix this, I've added some orcs to the spawning lists, similar to Bandit Lines Expansion's "Dark Elf Voices" patch. It will still be super rare to find an Orc vampire, but you will definitely find a couple across your playthrough. These vampire will use their vampire vanilla lines (which you probably have never heard before) and all the new lines for orc vampires added by this mod.
  
  
This is done in a very compatible-friendly way (No conflicts in my 1000+ modlist, including Requiem) but I'm marking this as optional in case you don't want the vampire orcs.

My other vampire related mods:
  
- **[Sun Affects NPC Vampires](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47277)**: This mod has just received a huge update, I recommend checking it out. 0 compatibility issues with other vampire mods.
  
- **[Vampire Lords Can Fly](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46023):** *\*Wheeeeeeee\* -* Scriptless implementation of flying mechanics. Still not convinced? How about this: Mod page is full of memes.
  
- **[Vampire Feeding Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47225?tab=description)**: adds new ways to feed, aka "sneak feed", "combat feed" and "recent corpse feeding". Works on top of vanilla/other vampire mods.
  
  
This mod is part of the "Lines Expansion" series. These mods work with one another and go beyond what their titles describe.

**Is this flagged ESL?**Yes.
  
  
**Can I install this mid-game?**Yes. 
  
  
**Have you seen the amazing new AI voices? Will you be implementing these into your mods?**Yes, I've heard them. They indeed sound pretty much perfect and it's pretty mind-blowing. I can't help but feel conflicted about it though, so I have no plans to clone any vanilla voices at the moment. Yes, I'm aware splicing could be described as similar, but the only way to have spliced lines sound half-acceptable is to touch the original lines as little as possible. Splicing is all about taking the existing audio files that Bethesda provided to us and reusing them in a different context, with as fewer changes as possible. Putting two lines together from within the game files is quite different than training an AI network with another person's voice and having them say whatever you want. Voice cloning is probably going to get some pushback from the voice actors we know and love (it's [already happening](https://kotaku.com/ai-voice-actors-steve-blum-elevenlabs-contracts-sell-1850108292)) and will eventually be regulated, so even though I'm impressed, I'd rather take a cautious stance for now.
