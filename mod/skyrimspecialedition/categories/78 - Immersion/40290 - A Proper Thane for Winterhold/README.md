With Hearthfire installed, the only hold in Skyrim where you can neither purchase a house nor be given a housecarl is Winterhold.  No longer!  Complete your status by acquiring a modest house with all crafting stations, and a marriageable Breton houscarl with all of the skills of Marcurio!  Requires Hearthfire, and a new game if you want everything to work as intended.
