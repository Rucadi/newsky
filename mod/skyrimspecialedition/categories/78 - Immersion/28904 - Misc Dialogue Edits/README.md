**Version for original Skyrim [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/98250)**

**Version for XBOX [size=1]([b][size=1]not by us**)[/size] [here](https://mods.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/mod-detail/4305444) or [here bundled with More Dialogue Options](https://mods.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/mod-detail/4305586)﻿[/b][/size]

  

**Please ENDORSE if you like the mod ❤️**

  
[font=Trebuchet MS]**Misc Dialogue Edits** is a collection of subtle fixes and improvements to Skyrim's dialogue, achieved with unobtrusive edits and meticulously spliced voice lines from the vanilla game:
  

* improves many dialogues related to **dragons** by adding alternate lines with conditions, to simulate how knowledge about the existence of dragons and the Dragonborn would spread across Tamriel (e.g. no more treating dragons as rumor if one attacked the day before)

* fixes the dialogue during the **Companions**' quest CR14, Dragon Seekers, so that Vilkas and Farkas no longer express uncertainty about the existence of dragons, because they have already faced one during an earlier quest

* regulates annoying dialogue lines that **vendors** often say, so that they feel more appropriate (e.g. Arcadia is much less likely to say that "you look rather pale", if you aren't sick or a vampire)

* fixes **typos**, **punctuation** and **pronunciation** of a plethora of dialogue lines that aren't covered by other mods

* improves a handful of small but meaningful **player dialogue options**, to make them feel more reasonable in their context, or to open them to more character builds, without changing their meaning (e.g. player option: "Which of the Eight Divines do you serve?" -> "Which Divine do you serve?")

* adds rules to improve the context of many conversations, to prevent them from happening in unfortunate or silly situations (e.g.: Romlyn won't try to sell you mead for cheap if Indaryn or Maven are right behind him)

* fixes **Traveling Merchant** and **Traveling Pilgrim** from being considered disguised Dawnguard instead of disguised vampires, which was causing their Dawnguard quest related dialogue to remain unavailable

* makes subtle adjustments to a few dialogue lines affected by less than ideal **voice acting** or by recording mistakes (e.g. Shadr no longer has a weird pause after he says "why" in "Why are you doing this to me?")

**Installation and compatibility**
  
All files are ESL-flagged. An installer is provided to automatically select the patches you need.
  
A patch to fit the dialogue with [Khajiit Speak](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/441) or similar can be found at [Even More Khajiit Speak Patches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40594).
  
This mod works well alongside USSEP, Relationship Dialogue Overhaul, Guard Dialogue Overhaul and alternate start mods, such as Skyrim Unbound Reborn (see Recommendations below for more). As a general rule, load this mod after other dialogue mods, but before quest mods. Any other kind of mod usually doesn't conflict, but, f you're unsure, looking for direct conflicts with xEdit should be enough to understand load order and compatibility with other mods: if a record directly conflicts with another mod's, only the mod that's loaded last will implement its changes to the game.
