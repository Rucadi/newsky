**WAIT CARRIAGE IN INNS**

  
  
WCI is a simple, lightweight and highly compatible mod that attemps to improve the transports system of Skyrim by trying to be as lore-friendly and immersive as possible. Neither the vanilla carriage system nor the landscapes have been altered in any way.
  
It's mainly aimed at players who have disabled fast travel, but you can enjoy it no matter how you play.
  
  
When close to an inn (except the ones outside Tamriel and the ones inside the 5 big cities), you just have to ask the innkeeper if you can wait for a carriage driver to arrive. Then, you will have to sit down to make the NPC driver appear and spend time in the current location. When ready, tell him the destination you would like to reach and he will take you there... as long as you spend enough gold. If you decide to leave the inn without talking to the NPC, he will stay there for 60 seconds before leaving the location.
  
  
The names of the carriage drivers you will encounter are: Angvric, Elgeld, Thalkvir and Wuufmare.
  
  
Yes, it also works with inns added by other mods as long as the mod author adds the correct keyword to the new buildings. In case an inn loaded by your favorite city mod doesn't work, let me know about it in the posts section and let's resolve this together. If you don't want the innkeeper dialogue to appear in some locations, use the MCM to exclude them.
  
  
All the possible destinations are the same as the ones used by Hearthfires carriage drivers, but I added the possibility to travel to your Hearthfires houses for an additional cost. You can enable or disable every iocation in the MCM.
  
  
All the dialogues are completly voiced. The voice lines have been generated from existing in-game sentences.

**COMPATIBILITY**
  
  
WCI doesn't include any vanilla changes and therefore should be compatible with anything!
  
  
Need some examples? WCI is compatible with any mods which:
  

  
* modifies interiors and exteriors cells
updates the price of transports
  
* adds new locations and inns
disables fast travel
  
* enhances carriage system

  
As you may guess it , load order doesn't matter!
  
  
  
**FAQ**
  
  
**Why did you create another carriage mod?**
  
I was unhappy with the last one and decided to take a new approach instead of updating my older mod.
  
  
**Why can I travel while over-encumbered?**
  
In the base game you cannot travel while over-encumbered but the USSEP team removed this feature long ago (USKP v1.0 - 2012-04-07), making you able to travel even when carrying too many items. As everyone is playing with USSEP these days, I decided to forward that change in my mod.
  
  
**I don't want the innkeeper dialogue to be available in x location!**
  
Use the MCM if you wanna exclude some inn locations which will prevent the dialogue to appear.
  
  
**ESPFE?**
  
Yes!
  
  
**Any requirements?**
  
SKSE + SkyUI.
  
  
**Can I install or uninstall this mod during my playthrough?**
  
Sure, as long as you reset the innkeeper dialogue and carriage NPC.
  
  
**Compatible with SSE and AE versions?**
  
Yes!
