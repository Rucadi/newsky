Ok this is a real old mod i've created/edited originaly for a different (never released) mod for Skyrim Vanilla, but it works nice also in Skyrim SE.
  
  
It modifies some collision variables to make the character no more "blend out" or "fade out" if you get too close to your own character in 3th person view (zoomed too close).
  
  
I've never released it (even it was created at 09-2013) and i lost the source, however - i forget, but it works fine for me in Skyrim SE. If you like try it at your own risk.
  
  
The latest Version 2 is working pretty well with SSE (btw. thanks to Spawnkiller for the F44/F43 convert and the code cleaning).
  
  
have fun, triplex2011
