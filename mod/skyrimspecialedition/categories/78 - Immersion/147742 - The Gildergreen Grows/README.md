**[size=6]The Gildergreen Grows**[/size]
  
This mod lets the Gildergreen Sapling progressively grow overtime, and you can see it slowly progress in size into the fully grown tree. There are 3 interim tree states between the fresh sapling and the fully grown Gildergreen. It will take the sapling roughly 4 months to fully grow to it's full size. This adds new reasons to go the peaceful route with Maurice during the Gildergreen quest. You will also have 2 new small dialogue lines with Danica, one when the tree has started growing and one when the tree has fully grown. The tree, once fully grown, will have falling petals around it.
  
  
You can also water the Gildergreen, via a bucket added by the tree. Interacting with it will make you water the tree via the bucket on the ground. Interacting with the bucket once the sapling is planted or once the tree has been repaired will give the player a short buff. Here is are the buffs available: Spoiler

  
* Kynareth's Vigor - Gain 10 Health for 2 hours. Available if you used the sap to restore the Gildergreen.
Kynareth's Renewal - Gain 5 Health Regeneration for 2 hours. Available if you got the sapling to plant a new Gildergreen.
  
* Kynareth's Renewal - Gain 10 Health Regeneration for 4 hours. Once the sapling is fully grown, you will receive this buff instead.
  
  
The mod is ESL Flagged and no unneeded CC masters.

**FAQ**
  
*Does this mod replace the tree or sapling model?*
  
No, it will use whatever replacer you have. This mod doesn't have any tree meshes or textures. I also don't add any clutter or hanging objects to the tree, those in the screenshots are just from a Gildergreen replacer I use.
  
  
*Can I add this midsave?*
  
Yes. If you have gotten the sapling already in your save, the growing process will start as soon as you change locations!
  
  
*Can I make the growth of the tree faster?*
  
Yes. You can edit the global value "TGGGrowthDelay" in xEdit or in the console type "set TGGGrowthDelay to X", with X being how many days you want each tree stage to last!
  
*I completed the quest but I have a fully grown tree and no sapling.*
  
You need to complete the quest by getting a new sapling for Danica, not getting sap to heal the existing tree.
