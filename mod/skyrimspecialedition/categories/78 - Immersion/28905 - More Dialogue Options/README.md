**Please ENDORSE if you like the mod ❤️**

  
[font=Trebuchet MS]This mod improves and expands on a variety of small conversations you often end up engaging in during any playthrough, with the aim to make them more straightforward, sensible and immersive. All the new lines are voiced by carefully splicing the original sound files of the game, to make them feel as if they could have been in the game all along. Here are a few examples of what to expect.
  
  

  
* **Maul**

The first conversation with Maul always felt a bit strange to me: he starts by intimidating you into staying out of the Black-Briars' business, but then, without prompt, he changes the subject into asking for work. It's easy to assume that this was done to add an easy way for the player to know that the Thieves Guild exists in Riften, but there are improvements to be made. The core of the problem is his response to your question, "*Who are the Black-Briars?*": he answers, but then he seems to suddenly answer another hidden question, "*Who are you?*". To fix this, I separated these two parts with their own dialogue options: after you ask about the Black-Briars, you have the choice to ask who he is and show interest in his business, which continues the vanilla conversation, or to agree to stay out of the Black-Briars' business and end the conversation. [Here's what it looks like](https://youtu.be/AF_B_gxf4bs).
  
  

  
* **Delayed Burial**

If you don't rush to meet Aventus Aretino in Windhelm, you can meet Cicero at Loreius Farm, northeast of Whiterun, alongside a cart with a broken wheel. He asks you to help him convince Loreius to fix it and you can use your Speech skill to pass a persuasion check. Problem is that check with Loreius can't be failed. What's worse is that your argument is quite different from his perspective on the matter, so it really shouldn't be that easy to convince him. So, I made a few improvements: I added the possibility to fail the vanilla persuasion check and increased its difficulty, then I added two more persuasion checks with different levels of difficulty, depending their affinity with his view of the situation, plus an intimidation check for those who'd rather go that route; finally I added a dialogue option before the checks, to provide a different way of approaching him, for immersion's sake, and an option to refuse Cicero's request entirely.
  
  

  
* **Thieves Guild**

When first talking to **Tonilia** to receive your Thieves Guild armor, you get only one path in the conversation, which leads you to ask if she does anything for free. She's quite bothered by that question, obviously, being her the fence of the guild. So, I added a dialogue option to simply agree with her when she explains what she does, allowing you to avoid behaving like a smirky bastard. Oh, you want to behave like that? Well, you I added one more dialogue option just for you in that same conversation: a smirky/flirty one, at a point that fits rather well.
  
Ok, we need to address **Taking Care of Business**. What's the point of having dialogue options to try to convince someone, if you already know that you will certainly succeed or certainly fail because there's no persuasion or intimidation check? That's what I thought when talking to Bersi, Haelga or Keerava during that quest. So I turned those options into real checks: now you have the real possibility to convince them to give you the coins through dialogue and to fail doing so, if you aren't skilled enough. It all fits perfectly, especially because the vanilla game already implements more than one path to success, so now you have even more options, and they are all meaningful.
  
With these improvements implemented, I couldn't avoid taking a look at the rest of the Thieves Guild questline, starting from its core: the conversations with **Brynjolf**. The issue is not necessarily a lack of dialogue options, but that many of them are quite characterized (smirky comments, foolish questions, ..., options that don't fit many backstories and personalities). That's why added more neutral responses and alternate paths to his conversations. The improvements only reach the end of the deadbeats quest ("Taking Care of Business") for now, but I intend to check more, eventually. As always, I aim to achieve the best result possible with the least changes, so I'll do my best to take compatibility into account.
  
  

  
* **Aela**

When talking to Aela right after the Giant's attack at Pelagia Farm, you have no choice but to either insult her work or show interest in joining the Companions. This mod adds a new option to end the conversation in a more neutral way, she'll answer politely and won't suggest you to join. While I was at it, though, I also improved the opposite path: I added the option to talk to her about joining right away, so you don't have to ask who the Companions are if you were born and raised near Whiterun.
  
  

  
* **Maramal**

Are your parents Nords? Have they narrated a thousand times the way they met and how they married? Why would you ask Maramal to explain that to you, then? When you talk to the priest after his scene at the Bee and Barb, you'll be able to tell him that you know how marriage works in Skyrim, to skip his explanation and reach the option to buy the amulet more quickly.
  
  

  
* **Brunwulf**

The first conversation with him seems slightly disappointing: he asks "*You one of those "Skyrim for the Nords" types?*" and the answers available don't offer you much of a choice, really. There is some variation for Nords, but not much. That's why I added a new dialogue option for anyone who isn't a Nord: "*Do I look like one?*". He'll apologize and then continue with the vanilla conversation by stating his position on the matter. Wait, why should he even ask that if you're a Dark Elf? In that case Brunwulf will skip the questions altogether and start with the next vanilla dialogue, by expressing his disappointment about the condition of your kin in the city.
  
  

  
* **Viarmo**

During the quest "Tending the Flames" for the Bards College you get to help fill in the gaps in Olaf's verse. Despite the amount of options during the process of actually writing the missing parts, there's a distinct lack thereof right before that moment: you have to be the one who suggests to make up the missing sections, no way around it. Well, I added the option to have no idea how to proceed once you discover that parts of the verse are missing. If you choose that, Viarmo will be the one to, reluctantly, suggest to do so.
  
  

  
* **Revelers**

Remember the Drinking Companions random encounter? Three cheerful Revelers who stop you to offer you a bottle of Honningbrew Mead? Well, there's a problem: you can only accept enthusiastically, offer them a bottle yourself or upset them by offering Black-Briar Mead instead. I saw a lack of a middle ground there. What if you're a milk drinker, but you still want to be somewhat polite? Or you just want move on because you're late for Vittoria Vici's wedding? To satisfy these needs, I added two options: you can respond "*Fine.*" and get a bottle (that you'll probably sell at the nearest inn), or you can refuse politely (they'll be a bit disappointed, but understanding).
  
  

  
* **...and more!**

Many options and smaller quality-of-life tweaks [such as this](https://youtu.be/6EnTz_J8w8A).
  
  
**Installation and compatibility**
  
All files are ESL-flagged. An installer is provided to automatically select the patches you need.
  
A patch to fit the dialogue with [Khajiit Speak](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/441) or similar can be found at [Even More Khajiit Speak Patches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40594).
  
As a general rule, load this mod after other dialogue mods, but before quest mods. Any other kind of mod usually doesn't conflict, but, f you're unsure, looking for direct conflicts with xEdit should be enough to understand load order and compatibility with other mods: if a record directly conflicts with another mod's, only the mod that's loaded last will implement its changes to the game.
