**~Dremora Lines Expansion~**

Dremora in Skyrim barely have any lines, despite being a somewhat common enemy and summon. This means you will end up tired of hearing "I honor my lord... by destroying you!" again and again. Well, let's fix that, shall we?
  
  
**Features**:
  
  

  
* Expands vanilla dremora lines (The "vanilla" dremora default voice now has access to new dialogue, provided via splicing)
Dremora now feel more "humanoid" as opposed to just another random creature summon. If activated, they will respond to you with a greeting. As stated in the lore, they're intelligent beings, bound to you temporarily via the spell that summoned them.
  
* Expands Dremora face and voice variety (with new assets for eyes, horns, face paint, hairstyles, voices and more!). You might also face some female dremora, same as in past games and in the lore. (This is achieved via: **[Additional Dremora Faces](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97946))**
Instead of having only 1 voice for all dremora, this mod now introduces 6 additional voices. Each dremora you encounter or summon will have their own voice and lines. These have been voiced by talented VA with professional-level recording equipment.
  
* This means that each time you summon a dremora, they will have 1 of 7 possible voices. (as opposed to only 1, in vanilla)
The new lines are written in the most vanilla-like style, while still bringing some much-needed fresh air into the game.
  
* Existing dremora conjurations (Butler and Merchant) have also been given the typical dremora voice filter for consistency.

  
  
**Requirements:**
  

  
* [Additional Dremora Faces](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97946)﻿: ESL-flagged mod that increases the variety of faces of dremoras – and now also the voices.

  
  
**Friendly Disclaimer**:
  
  
I'm very accepting when it comes to criticism and feedback and I always welcome your thoughts on my mods... positive or negative. However, let me make this clear: I don't want to see anyone disrespecting the voice actors/actresses. This is a dealbreaker that will get you banned immediately from my mod pages. Feedback is welcome, but please always stay respectful towards the cast**.**
  
  
**Voice Talent:**
  
I've had the luck to work with amazing voice professionals for this project. The new lines are, in my opinion, equiparable to vanilla in quality, style and writing and I hope they seamlessly become part of your adventures in Skyrim.
  
  
Curious about the amazing people behind your favorite new dremoras? Open the spoiler! I've grabbed one fun quote from the conversations that came out of audiotioning and recording the lines, plus a couple of my favorite lines from each!

Spoiler
  
  
When looking at the performances, it's important to consider the [male](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09cx0MX-odQ) and [female](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEAttaN3d90&t=538s) voice references. But also keep in mind that dremora variance and appearance is greatly expanded in this mod, so it's natural that their type of voice is also more varied while still plausible.

﻿Urgie is an excellent voice actor and [Twitch streamer](https://www.twitch.tv/urgie/about)﻿. He's even featured in Skyrim on Skooma and several other mods.
  
He's super fun to hang around, yet also extremely professional. Fun fact: he sometimes installs mods without reading their descriptions. Yolo!

AJ claims to be a voice actor, but I personally have my suspicions he's just a dremora IRL.
  
Dremora or not, he's super talented and can be contacted over at [his own website](https://ominamalum.wixsite.com/anthony-woest)﻿ for jobs and projects.

Junk is a talented artist in different fields... and luckily for us one of them is voice acting!
  
Hope this is not their last Skyrim modding project! You can leave Junk a tip over at [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/junkcubus).

﻿FatherPudding is *mysterious*. Self described as a "large and powerful individual", his voice clearly conveys this. 
  
Or maybe he's tiny and the rest is excellent voice acting. You can find out for yourself in his [Casting Call Club](https://www.castingcall.club/fatherpudding) page.

**- ESL flagged? Safe to install mid-game?**
  
Yes, mortal. The dremoras wouldn't have it any other way.
  
  
**- I thought you were playing Starfield? Why are you back?!**Fine, I'll leave!! Nah, without Creation Kit for Starfield, I can't quite start making mods there. And also, it's a tradition now that I upload a spooky mod for October. First I brought you [House of Horrors QE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57285) in 2021, [The Whispering Door QE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76606) in 2022, and now I bring you the spooky Dremora Lines!
  
  
**- Are you going to make more mods with voice actors?**Maybe? Let me know if you like this approach and I might consider it.
  
  
**- Where did you find this amazing talented cast?**Via the Skyrim Voice Alliance discord + Casting Call Club.
  
  
**- What sound effect did you use for the dremora voice?**Each voice had different settings, but a mix of a lower pitch + multi voice chorus effect in Audacity.
  
  
**- Female demoras?!?! They shouldn't exist!!! And even if they did, they ought to be in the oblivion kitchen realm!**Woah there, chill, friend, chill. Female dremoras have been a thing in past TES games. Also, I sincerely hope they kick your ass in-game.
  
  
**- Why is "Additional Dremora Faces" a requirement?**First of all, [Andrealphus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5646623?tab=user+files) is a great mod author that has been creating awesome mods consistently for a long time now. Check out his mod page if you haven't done so yet, you'll come out with a few gems for sure. Second, this mod required me to create new dremoras to give them the new voice types, so why not use an existing mod that already does this and save me the trouble. Additional Dremora Faces is also flagged as ESL, comes with patches and attemps to touch as few records as possible, so installing it shouldn't give you issues.
  
  
**- I see you made your own collection. Why should I give it a chance?**[Aladdin put it best.](https://media.tenor.com/185-dSml7bsAAAAC/trust-me-aladdin.gif) Say *yes*, and I can show you a whole new world in my magic carpet﻿, I mean, collection.
