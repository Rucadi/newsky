 Ryn's Lost Valley Redoubt

One of Skyrim's most unique exterior locations, Lost Valley Redoubt offers the player an exterior-dungeon experience, leading up to an exciting fight with two Hagravens, and their revived Briarheart.
  
I love this location so much, I wanted to give it the exciting design it deserved, and give the player a proper reward for completing a difficult location- which is now even more difficult with more enemies and a secondary boss-fight after the Hagravens.

A very special friend of mine who encouraged me to start modding.
  
Those who have helped encourage me, helped with feedback, and supported my work, thank you.
  
Without you, I do not think this project would continue.
  
As always, I love you, and happy modding.
