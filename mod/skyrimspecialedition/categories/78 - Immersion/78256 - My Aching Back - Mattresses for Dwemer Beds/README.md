**Description:**
  
  
This is a simple and straightforward mod that tries to resolve one annoyance I've always had with Vanilla Skyrim; and that's the fact some of the Markarth citizens still sleep on the cold stone slab beds. I know they're hardened Nords, But come on! :) This mod adds a believable mattress to the Dwemer beds. Perhaps this brings some ***immersion*** to your game. Now the Silverblood Inn room rental is actually worth the Septims!
  
  
The mattress is worn and gritty enough to also seem reasonable in the abandoned Dwemer dungeons. Ancient Dwemer technology allowed them to create mattresses that stands the test of time :)
  
  
There's texture resolution on the mattress is 4K diffuse, 2K normals.
  
  
**Two versions of the mod -**
  

  
1. Simple replacer (no esp) This is a Dwemer Bed mesh replacer, so you'll see the mattresses on any Dwemer beds added from other mods / player homes. This mod also works with JaySerpa's magnificent "Use Those Blankets" mod.
BOS version. Only replaces occupied places with my mattress meshes.
  

  
  
You can choose between 4K and 2K texture resolution on the mattress. (In the files section).
  
  
Please let me know if you have any feedback or if anything looks odd. The meshes aren't exactly perfect, but I believe it's a small improvement :) Feel free to post any screenshots you take.
