# Fare Thee Well - Spouses and Children Give Blessings (TAGS - Family)
- Author: Lollialuna
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56366


**Are you about to leave on yet another adventure? Why not say a proper farewell to your spouse and children? Let them know of your intentions, and they may confer a blessing--or a portent of doom--upon you.**
  
  
Fully voiced and utilizing carefully spliced and re-purposed dialogue, Fare Thee Well covers 29 voice types (or 31 if using the latest version), with 5 different conversations possible for each voice type. Everything is based on new records, so there are no conflicts with other dialogue or perk mods.
  
  
Each blessing (and curse) lasts for 5 in-game days. You cannot receive a new blessing until the previous one has expired. However, it *is* possible to have 2 blessings (or curses) active at the same time by receiving one from your spouse and another from an adopted child.
  
  
  
11/04/24: This page has been a bit of a construction zone for a while. Rest assured, Fare Thee Well is still alive and kicking, and moving towards a major update.

**The list of features:**
  
  
  
  
**A testimonial courtesy of Modswell - starts around 2:37:**
  
  
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
**In essentials, spouses can:**
  
  
Urge Care - Your beloved has urged you to take care of yourself. To comfort them, you put far more effort into your healing spells and crafted potions.
  
  
Express Devotion - Your beloved's devotion makes you feel able to take on almost any threat. Your magical wards are more effective, and you derive greater benefit from wearing armor.
  
  
Entreat Divines - Your beloved has entreated the higher powers to watch over your safety. Death seems less able to catch up with you.
  
  
Instill with Confidence - Your spouse has great confidence in your abilities. Your effectiveness with elemental spells and weapons of all types is greatly improved.
  
  
Confess Fear - Your beloved is clearly less than convinced that you will return home alive. You cannot help but be affected by their fear.
  
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
**In essentials, children can:**
  
  
Urge Caution - Your child's skill at hide-and-seek appears to have rubbed off on you. Your caution does you credit as others have a harder time detecting your presence.
  
  
Boast about Strength - Your child has great confidence in your abilities. You feel very refreshed and could take on the whole world with just your bare hands.
  
  
Enthuse about Treasure - Gold! Gems! Relics! You are ready to tackle the toughest of locks and haul home as much treasure as you can safely carry.
  
  
Instill with Youthful Enthusiasm - Your child's enthusiasm is very inspiring! You feel more energized and eager to learn as much as possible.
  
  
Bestow Guilty Conscience - Leaving your child behind leaves a void in your heart. Try as you might to justify your reasons, you cannot win against your guilty conscience.

**Extra Details: Entreat Divines Dialogue**I took into account some of the unique NPCs and made special responses for them. Erandur specifically calls upon Mara, Aela calls upon Hircine, Eola on Namira, a couple members of the Skaal (Edla and Morwen) call upon the All Maker--you get the idea.  
  
  
Some of the NPCs I did this for actually cannot be married in the vanilla game, but I have heard of people marrying them through either other mods or console commands, so I decided to just forge ahead and create the dialogue.
  
  
**Extra Details: Additional Children Farewells**
  
Once you receive a blessing from one of your children, the farewell dialogue will vanish. Have more than one child? Do not be dismayed! A new dialogue option will become available so that you may say farewell to any other children in your care. This option will remain available for as long as the blessing/curse lasts. It has three variants as to the response of the child, but does not result in any special effect being given to the player.
  
  
**Extra Details: Blessings**Each blessing gives a small boost (it varies per blessing) to Health, Magicka and/or Stamina. Ultimately, these boosts are what will appear in the Active Effects panel bearing the description of each blessing.
  
  
The main effects of the blessings are primarily based off of the vanilla perk trees. As stated earlier, everything is new records, so these blessings will not interfere with any perk tree overhauls or (if you play without any overhauls) stop you from using the vanilla perk trees.
  
  
**Extra Details: Curses**
  
Curses might be a tad overwhelming if you are a very low level character, especially if you are unfortunate enough to be demoralized by both your spouse and child at the same time. *You have been warned.*
  
  
**Extra Details: Bonus Breakdown**
  
Please see [this article](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/5472) for more of a breakdown on received bonuses. 
  
  
**Extra Details: Dialogue Requirements**For the dialogue options to appear, you must:
  
  
1. (For spouse dialogue) be married.
  
  
2. (For child dialogue) have adopted a child.
  
  
3. Your spouse and children must also have the appropriate voice types and not currently be acting as followers. 
  
  
For any newlyweds out there, wait until your spouse leaves the Temple of Mara. The dialogue usually appears once they set off for home.
  
  
If the dialogue still proves stubborn, save your game and then reload it.
  
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
**Mod Requirements:**You only require the Hearthfire and Dragonborn DLCs to run Fare Thee Well (versions 1.0 and 1.1, respectively. Anything beyond those versions requires the Dawnguard expansion).
  
  
If running the mod for the first time, I would recommend starting a new game. However, I *have* had mixed results with this during various test phases, so feel free to try it out on older saves if you are feeling daring. Results may vary, though.
  
  
SE/AE players: You might require [Scrambled Bugs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43532) in order for the effects of the perks (the blessings and curses) to function properly. 
  
  
I would also highly recommend using [Fuz Ro D-oh](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15109) if using version 1.2 and beyond. Version 1.2 features new silent dialogue that will play for any spouse provided that they are in the PlayerMarriedFaction and not already voiced by Fare Thee Well.
  
  
For a full list of voice types that *are* voiced, please see the top post in the comments section.
  
  
**Warning:** Due to the way that Fare Thee Well's scripts work (directly through dialogue segments), the mod is NOT a viable candidate for the ESL treatment.
  
  
**Notice:** Although unconfirmed at present, be very careful if you are using any mods or SKSE plugins that dabble with dispelling or removing Magic Effects from the player character. Such things may affect Fare Thee Well's dialogue-linked Magic Effects and cause its dialogue options not to display.
  
  
**Future Plans:** Efforts are underway to tidy up a large update to Fare Thee Well. After that, features will be updated on an incremental basis. - November 24, 2024
