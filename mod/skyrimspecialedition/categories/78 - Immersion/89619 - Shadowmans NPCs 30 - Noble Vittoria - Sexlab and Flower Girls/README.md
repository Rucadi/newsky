The importance of being Earnest by Oscar Wilde is my favorite play, which is a satire of Victorian ways.
  
This small mod involves the noblewoman Vittoria Vici, cousin of the emperor.
  
The player is making very improper and crude suggestions to her, while Vittoria replies as a polite lady, always staying in character no matter how lewd the player's language may be.
  
  
Written for a Male player but I added conditions to filter sentences and make it friendly to female players as well, as much as possible.
  
  
268 lines of dialogue.
  
  
Thanks to the "mortified anonymous helper" for creating the immaculate audio.
