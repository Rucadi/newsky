**Description**
  
  
After reading [this topic](https://old.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/wfppff/another_post_beating_the_dead_horse_that_is/) and discussing it with some of my fellow mod authors, I decided to came up with my own take on Redbelly Mine. **I am aware that many other Redbelly Mine mods already exist and I do recommend them as alternatives to this one. Kudos to their authors. I wish them all the best.**
  
  
This mod is not claiming to be "canon" by any means (although as lore friendly as possible), but rather my own personal interpretation of it, and as such has some subjective changes.
  
  
My mod does the following:
  
  

  
* Redbelly Mine has its 3 veins changed to Iron ones, like in USSEP, however, I used a different ground dirt texture set so they blend better with the rest of mine textures.
At the bottom, I added an extra 4th vein, which is Ebony Ore.
  
* The spider at the bottom of the cave is now a Giant one, with a slightly higher level, to simulate being their matriarch.
The ore sample "Quicksilver Ore" from [Truth Ore Consequences](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Truth_Ore_Consequences) has been changed to an Ebony Ore mesh and renamed "Ore Sample".
  
* In the same quest, you can now tell Finjar that you recognise the ore if you have the Ebony Smithing perk, for a small reward. (see image)

  
  
As for the Red Fog being mentioned in the mine, I would recommend [USSEP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266), which in fact adds it.
  
This mod does not require USSEP, but it is highly recommended, for this reason.
  
  
**FAQ**
  
  
Q: ESPFE?
  
A: Yes.
  
  
Q: Does installing/updating/uninstalling on an existing save work?
  
A: As far as I know, it should. However, it's good practice to keep a backup save prior to doing this, just in case.
  
  
Q: Is this compatible with <insert mod>?
  
A: I don't know by heart. You might need to check yourself.
  
  
Q: Will you make a patch for <insert mod>?
  
A: Only if it's a mod I use myself or plan on using, I have enough time and I actually like the idea. Otherwise, feel free to do it yourself. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: I have a suggestion to improve the mod. Can you do it?
  
A: Maybe, if I have time and I like the idea, I'll consider it.
  
  
Q: Will you port this to <insert platform>?
  
A: No, I myself only support the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If someone else wants to port it, feel free. (see permission) If you decide to port it, you yourself take full responsibility to offer support to said port. I will not provide no support for any ports by third parties.
  
  
Q: I use a ported version of this mod on <insert platform> and I have a problem. Can you help?
  
A: I don't provide any support for third party ports on other platforms than the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If you have issues, you should adress the person that ported it.
  
  
Q: Does this work on Skyrim 1.6+, aka "Anniversary Edition"?
  
A: Yes, it should.
  
  
Q: Why don't your mods use MCMs and instead use this janky console command system to set globals?
  
A: I am not a fan of MCMs. You can set the globals by making a patch in xEdit. I have no plans of changing this. If you want to add an MCM, feel free. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: Why don't you use FOMODs?
  
A: That would require reuploading the entire mod, in question, even if I only make a small change. My internet is limited and reuploading the files each time will take a huge chunk of my monthly volume.
