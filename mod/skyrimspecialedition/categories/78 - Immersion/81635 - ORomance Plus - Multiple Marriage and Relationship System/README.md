**DESCRIPTION:
  
Think the marriage system is stupid? Want to roleplay as an Orc Warchief and have many spouses?**
  
  
ORomance Plus is a "NG" enhancement of the popular relationship mod ORomance, now independent of Ostim (OStim is now OPTIONAL, you can still use it).
  
  
The Original ORomance mod was a relationship and romance framework that let you build relationships with any NPC in the game.  Each NPC was generated with a unique personality which determined whether or not they'd be open to a romance with you (either that be a fling, long-term, or marriage). It also has cheating detection, gift giving, complimenting, insulting, etc all on a separate UI via the Iwant Widgets system.
  
  
ORomance Plus allows fully featured polygamy (multiple marriages up to 11 additional spouses) with the vanilla wedding quests and scenes, spouse stores, and breakup.

PROVIDED PATCHES:
  
  
-In order to de-clutter this main page, checkout the newly created ORomance Plus official Patch hub: [Official ORomance Plus Patch Hub at Skyrim Special Edition Nexus - Mods and Community](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/135675)
  
  
INCOMPATIBILITY:
  
  
Mods like [An Appropriately Attired Wedding Couple SE at Skyrim Special Edition Nexus - Mods and Community](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44855)   will only work for the first spouse you marry, since it only affects the vanilla marriage system.  Any marriage onward won't have this mod impact it, since it's a completely new quest/system. I recommend using this mod: [Spouse Wears Wedding Dress at Skyrim Special Edition Nexus - Mods and Community](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/160695) instead that I made, that has a patch for ORomance Plus in the patch hub: [Official ORomance Plus Patch Hub at Skyrim Special Edition Nexus - Mods and Community](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/135675)
  
  
Any mod that offers multiple marriage support with wedding scenes/quest is not compatible, as ORomance Plus v2.0+ does the same thing but done in a modern fashion and properly bug tested for months. 
  
  
[Marry Anyone at Skyrim Special Edition Nexus - Mods and Community](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64327) , this mod does the same thing already.
  
  
[Relationship Dialogue Overhaul - RDO SE at Skyrim Special Edition Nexus - Mods and Community](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1187), buggy and incompatible due to how it handles some spouse shop dialogue lines. I recommend using [Relationship Dialogue Overhaul Lite at Skyrim Special Edition Nexus - Mods and Community](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42068) , where there is a patch in the [Official ORomance Plus Patch Hub at Skyrim Special Edition Nexus - Mods and Community](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/135675)
  
  
[Relationship Change Notifications at Skyrim Special Edition Nexus - Mods and Community](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34670?tab=description) might have an incompatibility, due to it's changes to the Relationshipmarriednode in the story manager, and using the "share events" flag which can cause issues with other mods that use a similar story node (which I do) (source: [SM Event Node - the CreationKit Wiki](https://ck.uesp.net/wiki/SM_Event_Node#Known_Issues)). It might cause proposing to  certain NPCs that were once enemies to immediately fail the marriage quest, thus triggering the marriage breakup quest where you need to reconcile with the NPC.
  
  
[ORomance Plus - Ostim Standalone Kissing patch at Skyrim Special Edition Nexus - Mods and Community](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/108748?tab=description) incompatible and redundant. It's functionality has been implemented into ORomance Plus as of v2.11, and the patch is outdated and breaks other mechanics.
  
  
[You Got Caught for OStim SA - Cheating And Public Lewdness Reactions at Skyrim Special Edition Nexus - Mods and Community](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/139697) this mod is \*semi-compatible, both mods cheating logic will both be running, so you can run into odd bugs if both mods are competing against each other to do an operation (like changing a NPC's relationship rank, making them hostile, etc.).  When using this, there is a confirmed bug that the harem charm and monogamy stat being lower than 15 won't be respected.
  
  
**﻿VR is reported to not work with this mod. I** will not offer any help (as I can't, no VR gear).
  
  
  
**Why use ORomance Plus over it's competitors?**
  
  
1. It uses the IWantWidget's UI which separates it from the vanilla dialogue tree.  So many mods use the vanilla dialogue tree that it can get extremely cluttered, and make certain NPCs who typically don't have any dialogue options (guards, etc.) say their idle lines less.
  
  
2. The relationship mechanics are much more complex and depend on your own personal achievements as the player  character such as Faction questlines, the main quest, your speech level, your overall level, how many houses you own, how many thaneships you possess, and much more.
  
  
3. Each NPC is given a generated personality, such as their sexuality, prudishness, promiscuous-ness, etc.  This system can then be configured in-game via the [ORomance Plus Stat Editor mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98298), or via the [ORomance Plus SPID and OAR mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120804/), which one can then configure custom animations on said NPC personalities.
  
  
4. Improvements to the marriage system such as fully-featured polygamy: multiple marriages up to 11 additional spouses - 12 in total including the vanilla spouse (this includes store mechanics, wedding quest and scenes, vanilla dialogue, leaving the spouse at the alter, etc.) , divorcing, breaking up, supports some other popular marriage mods like 'Immersive Rejections'
  
  
5. As of version 2.0+, ORomance Plus is independent of the Ostim suite, making it completely optional. If you want to play SFW or just want the relationship features without using Ostim, this is the mod for you.
  
  
**The original ORomance description, please give it a read to understand the basic fundamentals**!
  
Spoiler
  
How it works
  
To start ORomance, simply approach an NPC and press the ORomance hotkey while facing them. This will start a special dialogue with the ORomance menu available. You now have many options available to you
  
  
Romance
  
- Try to seduce
  
If you succeed, you the npc will ask you to lead them to an area to have sex in. Press the ORomance key on the NPC while they are following you to start the OStim sex scene.
  
  
Typically, approaching random NPCs and trying to seduce them will fail unless your speech stat is extremely high. Some (but not all) NPCs much prefer that you start a relationship with them before they will have sex with you. Some NPCs, do however, prefer being a friend-with-benefits, and will let you seduce them long before they will agree to a relationship with you.
  
  
-Try to kiss
  
If you succeed, you will kiss the NPC. This makes them like you quite a bit more, and therefore will make other actions easier to perform after this. 
  
  
Most NPCs will prefer to kiss you before they agree to full-on sex, but some of them aren't a fan of lovey-dovey stuff, and will prefer to just have sex.
  
  
- Prostitution
  
For when you need a quick fix. This only appears if an NPC is a prostitute. For example, tavern wenches are prostitutes. Other NPCs are marked as prostitutes as well, so ask around
  
You can select if you would like a handjob, blowjob, or full control. The options get more expensive depending on which you pick.  You can expect to pay a few hundred gold at least
  
  
Interact
  
- *Inquire*
  
﻿- Ask about sexual experience
  
The NPC will tell you about their sexlife and/or thoughts on sex. You can get some information about them and their personality type based on their response. If an NPC is not familiar with you at all, they may refuse to answer.
  
  
- Ask about current relationships
  
The NPC will tell you if they're married or single
  
  
- Ask about sexuality
  
The npc will tell you their sexual preferences. If an NPC is not familiar with you at all, they may refuse to answer. 
  
  
- *Relationship*
  
-Confess Love
  
This will ask the NPC to become your boyfriend or girlfriend. Some NPCs are more comfortable with this than others. After an NPC is in a relationship with you, they are far more likely to be down for things like sex and kissing if they weren't before. Be warned though, if they see you getting physical with someone else, they will get angry with you and possibly break up
  
  
-Propose marriage
  
If the NPC accepts, this will start the vanilla wedding quest with them.
  
A small minority of NPCs will not have sex until marriage. NPCs that are married to you will do just about anything with you. Be careful though, if they see you cheating they can still divorce you
  
  
- Divorce/breakup
  
Does what it says. NPC will hate you afterwards. May be impossible to get back with them after this, so choose wisely.
  
  
- Give gift
  
"AAA YES I CAN'T WAIT TO GIVE EVERYONE I WANT TO SEDUCE 20 DIAMONDS AND WIN THEM OVER INSTANTLY"
  
Not how this feature works. Giving NPCs small gifts will temporarily boost how much they like you. The amount that it can boost is capped pretty low if the NPC is not your partner or spouse, so don't go wasting 1000 septim gifts on random NPCs.
  
  
-Compliment/insult
  
These give tiny boosts to how much an npc likes or dislikes you. Spamming them will make an NPC get annoyed with you. More effective if an NPC is already your partner or spouse
  
  
Skyrim's relationship system, versus ORomance's
  
Skyrim has a rudimentary relationship system, where NPCs have a number assigned to them that essential represents what they think of you. It ranges from -4 to 4, with -4 being an enemy, 0 being a stranger, and 4 being a lover. This system was not nearly advanced enough for what ORomance wants to do, so many new stats were added to the game, including but not limited to:
  
- How much an NPC likes you
  
- How much an NPC desires sex
  
- How much an NPC is willing to talk about sex in public
  
- How much an NPC wants to be in a loving relationship
  
- If an NPC is willing to have sex with you before being in a relationship, or married
  
- How much an NPC is willing to cheat if they're married to another NPC
  
- How much an NPC hates you
  
- How much an NPC loves you
  
- Other seduction difficulty modifiers based on their status and who they are
  
- More
  
  
ORomance still keeps track of vanilla's relationship system, however. So things that affect the vanilla system will affect ORomance and vice versa, for compatibility!
  
  
  
Player Charisma 
  
The number 1 thing that determines generally how successful you are at starting relationships and seducing NPCs is a hidden stat called your charisma. Your charisma is tied to your actions throughout your playthrough of Skyrim. Having very low charisma means you will be able to get almost nowhere with most NPCs. With an average/medium charisma value, you should be able to start consistently having success with NPCs that you spend time interacting with, traveling with, or doing quests for, depending on their stats and what they like. High charisma characters will be able to sometimes seduce NPCs on first meeting them.
  
  
What affects your charisma? The following things increase your charisma stat, from most to least (roughly):
  
- Increasing speech
  
- Leveling up
  
- Becoming a thane in an area (is extra effective with NPCs that live in that specific area)
  
- Purchasing and owning property
  
- Ending the civil war/killing alduin.
  
  
Remember though - charisma is only half of the equation. An NPC's personality stats, opinions of you, preferences, marital status, and much more heavily affect your success with them. See the getting started section down below for more info on playing effectively. 
  
  
Seduction and kissing 
  
If an NPC agrees to have sex with you, they will allow you to lead them to a private area of your choosing. Opening the ORomance menu on this NPC while they follow you will allow you to begin the OStim sex scene.
  
  
You can also perform a kiss with an NPC. This has a very positive effect on your relationship with said NPC. Thanks to it's versatility, kissing animations are processed and managed by OStim. 
  
  
You can also start a threesome. To do this, seduce an NPC while one is already seduced and following you. ~~Note, if you are in a relationship with one or both NPCs, the threesome will fail unless both NPCs have a personality that is OK with cheating~~. Starting threesomes with NPCs that are not in a relationship with you works best.
  
  
Success and failure
  
Normally, there's no indication that an ORomance action will succeed or fail (other than what you've inferred from Inquire and such). However, once an NPC becomes your partner, OR your speech level reaches level 50, you will gain the ability to loosely tell if an action will pass or not. This is indicated by selecting an option, then checking the color of an NPC's name at the bottom of the screen. The colors indicate the following:
  
  
Red - This action will no doubt fail
  
Yellow - This action may fail or succeed. If it fails, that NPC is "on the fence" about you, so you are somewhat close. Remember there is no RNG in these options, so if something is yellow, don't spam it, it will not succeed by doing it over and over again without changing anything
  
Green - This action will definitely succeed 
  
  
Since failing most actions gives you a temporary dislike penalty with that NPC, gaining this ability is very useful.
  
A colorless indicator is available in the MCM if you have trouble seeing the colors
  
  
Cheating
  
If one isn't enough for you, you can always choose to sleep around. You can also steal some NPCs spouses.
  
  
Player cheating
  
You can have as many girlfriends and boyfriends as you like. However, if one of them sees you getting physical with someone else, they will usually get angry and sometimes break up with you. NPCs that do not care much for monogamous relationships may not care and give you a pass, but these NPCs are rare.
  
When an NPC is angry at you, via cheating, insulting them over and over, or something else, you will not be able to interact with them and will have to wait for them to forgive you, or apologize to them over and over. Some NPCs may never forgive you.
  
If you want to do a harem type playthrough, you can seduce NPCs without making them your boyfriend/girlfriend. Doing this lets you freely have sex with them in from of each other. However, seducing NPCs without starting a relationship with them is more difficult (but entirely doable)
  
  
Stealing other's wives/husbands
  
Married NPCs are usually in a happy and satisfactory relationship~~. Seducing these NPCs is not realistically possible~~. It is technically possible to have a relationship and/or seduce any NPC if your player charisma is high enough. ~~However, the level required to seduce most of these NPCs is not attainable for all but the longest running player characters.~~
  
BUT. Some married NPCs (less than half, more than 1%) are willing to cheat if the right player comes along. Furthermore, some of these married NPCs are actually looking to cheat, and seducing them may be especially easy. Be careful though, if their spouse catches you in the act of having sex with their wife or husband, they will most likely get *extremely* angry. Fortunately most NPCs will refuse to start sex if they know their spouse is around (ultra horny NPCs don't care and will start sex regardless).
  
You can start relationships and even get married to these cheating NPCs, but it is even more difficult than seducing them. Killing a married npc's spouse makes them easier to seduce as long as you aren't caught. 
  
  
Opinions and memories
  
When interacting with an NPC, you may see one of two little icons pop up at the bottom of the screen. These either indicate that the action you tried to perform was successful or failed, or the NPCs opinion of you has gone up or down. Or both. Over many days, an NPC's opinion of you will slowly return to neutral. However, sometimes, some actions leave a permeant memory on the NPC these memories permanently affect the NPC's opinion of you.
  
Generally, being in a relationship or being married to an NPC makes it much easier to rack up "positive" thoughts about you. NPCs who you know casually will have less strong feelings towards you, but you can still leave permanent memories on them (i.e. having sex and giving them an orgasm).
  
  
Boyfriends, girlfriends, and marriage
  
With the Confess Love option, you can start a relationship with an NPC. Some NPCs prefer not to have sex before being in a relationship, so if you wish to have sex with those NPCs, you either need to form a relationship first, or have extremely high charisma.
  
You can also propose marriage to NPCs. Getting an NPC to accept that does not have a very high opinion of you, and also is in a relationship with you, is very difficult.
  
  
Inquiry
  
You can ask NPCs some questions about themselves, including their sexuality, if they're in a relationship, and their thoughts on sex. Their answers may help you guess how seducable they are. For example, married NPCs may sometimes comment that they are unhappy with their marriage (but they won't always, even if they are)! Quite often though, if an NPC doesn't know you at all, they will refuse to answer some questions you ask them.
  
  
Prostitution
  
Some NPCs are prostitutes. Whether or not they're a prostitute depends on their job. Tavern wenches, for example, are marked as prostitutes. Other types of NPCs are as well, but you will have to explore around to find them. Prices vary from prostitute to prostitute, and they also vary based on which sex act you select. When you select an act such as a blowjob, you will start a special, locked OStim scene that you can't control, and you will receive your service.
  
  
Sexualities
  
By default, all NPCs are bisexual. With the sexuality setting on, some NPCs are heterosexual and homosexual. It works about how you would expect - if an NPC isn't attracted to your gender, seducing them is basically impossible. So if an NPC isn't attracted to your gender, you pretty much can't do anything ORomance-related with them. You can ask their sexual preferences with the Inquire feature to find out what they prefer.
  
Percentage distribution is based off of real life survey data.
  
  
Ultra-tight OStim integration
  
Several actions you perform during OStim sex scenes can affect your relationship with an NPC.
  
  
Integration with other mods that start sex scenes
  
Let's say you have a quest mod that leads to you having sex with an NPC. Afterwards, as long as that quest played an OStim scene, ORomance will recognize this, and make said NPC easier to seduce for you, to keep immersion (otherwise, you would have a relationship with said NPC in the quest, but ORomance would not reflect that at all which would seem strange). 
  
  
Getting Started
  
Here are a few things you should know about the mechanics:
  
  
- There is no RNG in the success "rolls". That is to say, if you fail an action, repeating it immediately after, or savescumming and reloading will not affect the outcome at all.
  
- Low-level characters will fail. A lot. In fact, I recommend reaching level 5 and speech level 35 before even starting to try. Getting to speech level 50 is recommended. Enchanted gear that raises speech should work.
  
- Completing quests they offer is generally (but not always) the single best way to get an NPC to like you. Leveling up your speech is the second best, and works consistently across all NPCs. Travelling with them is also good if they are a follower.
  
- If an NPC is in a happy marriage, or if an NPC is not attracted to your character (i.e. a female character is a lesbian and you are a male character), you will probably not be able to seduce these NPCs. *Technically,*if your level and speech are high enough it is always possible, but it is not practical and may not be possible with vanilla level caps. 
  
  
In-depth guide
  
[Here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/3047). This guide is for people that want to know the innerworkings of the mod. As a casual user I advise not reading this
  
  
Difficulty tweaking & the MCM
  
ORomance settings appear in the add-ons tab of OStim's MCM
  
  
Want a more laid back experience? Raising the difficulty modifier will make things easier. My personal recommendation is to do a full playthrough at the default difficulty, then tweak the difficulty, but you can do what you please. Here's roughly how some settings will translate:
  
  
0 - The standard. Early game will be tough. By midgame you'll be able to seduce a lot of NPCs that are familiar with you. By late game you should start being able to easily seduce most NPCs
  
30 - This will make things slightly easier, as well as let low level characters get started with ORomance fairly early on. Overall though, won't make things too much easier
  
60 - From here, low level characters can get started with ORomance right away. By mid-game, you should be able to seduce a pretty good chunk of NPCs easily
  
90 - At this difficulty, you'll be able to have quite a bit of success with a lot of NPCs even at level 1. By midgame you'll no doubt be able to seduce nearly all NPCs
  
  
Values above 90 will mostly be a cakewalk.
  
With higher negative values you may not seduce anyone at all until the very late game.
  
  
Controls
  
By default, K on an npc starts a dialogue and left/right changes options. These are changeable by MCM
  
Your normal skyrim controls select options, and exit the menu. By default this is going to be E and tab.
  
  
Controller supported.
  
  
  
  
  
**What's New?**
  

  
* No longer needs Ostim and also a Safe For Work mode!
A revamped marriage system, that replaces the Vanilla Skyrim marriage method.
  
* Fully-featured multiple marriages, allowing multiple spouses! Has some new dialogue with Maramal to convince him to conduct more than one wedding ceremony!
Many bug fixes, including proper spouse detection, a working divorce/break-up feature. More listed below!
  
* More factors that increase your seduction attempts, such as Killing Alduin, being the Harbinger, and more!
Unique NPCs like Serana and Frea will now say lines in the ORomance framework, like the other vanilla voicetypes!
  
* a new MCM page which has QoL, debug options, and customizable features!
a new keyword system so unique animations and SPID can be more easily used!
  
* And much more! Read below and/or the changelog!

  
**More Voice Lines**
  

  
* Vanilla NPCs will now have more voice lines to ORomance interactions, whether that be apology rejections or successes, saying hello more frequently, and some new unique lines such as from Serana and Frea!

  
**Reworked Mechanics**
  

  
* The gift giving, apologizing, and  complimenting mechanics have all been reworked.  They are now less spammy like before.  most of  these have 24 hour cooldowns now, but give much more impact on the dislike/like stats.
When a character dislikes you (over 19), you now have the option to give a gift as well as apologize.  Gift giving is on its own 24 hour cooldown, and is shared with non-apology gift giving as well.
  
* reaching 30/30 like stat for a NPC now gives +1 to love stat every 7 days

  

**Safe For Work Mode**
  

  
* A new safe for work mode is now toggle-able in the MCM menu.  This will make NSFW (sex) scenes fade-to-black, pass the time one hour (kissing doesn't pass 1 hour), and increase the love and like stat of the NPC.
ORomance Plus  v2.0+ is now independent of Ostim, so if you want to use it without. It will replace all animation scenes with fade-to-black.
  
* Kissing scenes will still play in this mode as long as you have Ostim and kissing animations installed and generated via Nemesis
Cheating detection is implemented
  

  
**New Keyword System**
  
  
ORomance Plus now uses keywords to distinguish stat (sexuality, monogamy, sex desire, prudishness).  things like Open Animation Replacer can be easily used in junction with this new system. These will be applied in-game when you seed someone via the UI or through the stat editor,  but if you want to customize how NPC's are seeded in a new game, you can use the SPID  and Open Animations Replacer mod here:
  
 here: <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120804/>
  
  
Here are the keywords:
  
  
ORomance\_homosexual
  
ORomance\_bisexual
  
ORomance\_hetero
  
  
Prudishness\_High  (Prudishness above 66)
  
Prudishness\_Medium (Prudishness between 33 and 66)
  
Prudishness\_Low (Prudishness lower than 33)
  
  
MonogamyDesire\_High (Monogamy above 66)
  
MonogamyDesire\_Medium (Monogamy between 16 and 66)
  
MonogamyDesire\_Low (Monogamy below 16)
  
  
SexDesire\_High  (Sexual Desire above 66)
  
SexDesire\_Medium (Sexual Desire between 33 and 66)

**New Marriage System and Fully Featured Polygamy/Multi-marriage**
  

  
* The vanilla marriage dialogue option is blocked, now you will have to use Oromance Plus's UI method.  What this means is you won't have the "interested in me" dialogue option for NPCs anymore if your relationship rank is 1 or higher, that dialogue has been migrated into ORomance Plus. You will have to propose via ORomance Plus's UI by pressing the OR interact key, and navigating to the Relationships window.
Multiple marriages up to 11 additional spouses (12 total), full with wedding scenes/quest, including leaving the spouse at the altar, and them opening a shop (spouses currently only open stores if they are moved to a vanilla home - city + hearthfire). if they moved into one of your houses.  Just propose to an un-married NPC as long as the marriage quest is not currently active
  
* Additional marriages will give the player and the new spouse another wedding ring
You need an amulet of Mara equipped to propose marriage
  
* As of v2.12 of this mod, the first marriage works on any voice-typed NPC, including custom and non-vanilla voicetype supported NPCs (i.e. Ulfric). This initial marriage still is using the vanilla marriage questline system, so be mindful of conflicts!
Any Marriage after you've married the first spouse utilizes a new system introduced by the mod, which  supports Vanilla voice-type NPCs that were already supported in the base game (Khajit support and similar vanilla voice types will be in RDO patches)as well as having Universal Custom Voice Support  for non-vanilla marriage candidate voicelines (i.e. Delphine, Ulfric) are now supported for marriage (they do silent gestures and nods), this only works for your second and onward spouse, since the initial spouse is still using the vanilla marriage system!
  
* added some dialogue choices when you attempt to marry another spouse. You have some roleplay options: ﻿either pay 300 gold to Maramal as a donation to the temple so he'll be okay with arranging another wedding ceremony for you, ﻿if you're an orc male you can convince him to just do it (easy level persuasion requirement for option to show), ﻿or if you are an agent of Mara (completing "The Book of Love" quest), you can only pay 150 gold instead.
Wedding guests for any 2nd and onward marriage won't include any NPC that has a relationship rank of 4 with the player, unless you have the harem charm perk
  
* NPC's will only comment about your amulet of mara if they are open to being proposed
You can ask if they are interested in being married to you without any penalty to your like/love points (this is vanilla dialogue re-implemented into ORomance)
  
* Proper working divorce feature for spouses. It will remove the NPC from being recognized as your spouse, set their relationship rank to -2 so they will hate you, and will go back to their original home if they were living in one of yours.  This will free up the slot your spouse was taking, allowing you to marry more. Is technically possible for you to eventually re-marry this NPC, once their dislike points diminish and you have enough "seduction value" to ask them to be their gf/bf again.  You can then re-initialize the vanilla marriage wedding
You can now marry widows (either existing widows or newly created widows if you choose to do so)
  

  
**Bug Fixes**
  

  
* Previously there were many issues with the marriage system of ORomance
Fixed oromance not detecting your partner was a spouse (certain intimacy mechanics)
  
* Fixed oromance divorce and re-marriage system not working
many more small fixes that cover edge cases
  
* Full list of bug fixes are in the changelog section

  
**Infidelity**
  

  
* The original ORomance mod had a cheating mechanic, where depending on a NPC's randomly generated personality, they would either break up with you if they catch you cheating (in an ostim scene), or tolerate it.  Due to popular demand, there is now a way to avoid the cheating mechanic immersive-ly. Now, once your seduction value hits over a certain value (250), you will be granted a one-time message box telling you that your partners are now tolerant of you cheating or threesomes despite their monogamy levels. It will add a perk called "harem charm" and you can see this in your active effects tab.
If you don't want this harem charm, there is a MCM toggle to disable it. The perk will be removed upon the next ORomance UI opening.
  
* **THE MCM OPTION FOR THE HAREM CHARM DOES NOT MEAN YOU AUTOMATICALLY GET IT**, it's default enabled and having it toggled on means you're enabling the perk to be granted to you via natural playthroughs.  Use console commands to give yourself the perk if you want to cheat, or use the ORomance Plus Stat Editor to make it so NPC's tolerate cheating.
If you get caught cheating by either one of your partners or the NPC's partner, they will at times start combat with you (this is an existing old ORomance feature).  You can either sheath your weapon which can cause them to stop being hostile, suceed in using a calm spell, or just run away (hostility should drop after 24 hours) 
  

  
**Better Fame Detection**
  

  
* Defeating Alduin now gives you the same amount of fame as being a thane in all the holds, like it should!
Being the Harbinger now affects your fame, giving you the equivalent of being a thane in 5 kingdoms, as it is a very prestigious title that Skyrim citizens respect
  
* Having the Agent of Dibella perk now boosts your seduction capabilities, making it more important to do "The Heart of Dibella"
More implementation of vanilla deeds/quests are planned for the future!
  

  
**Quality of Life**
  
  

  
* Has its own MCM tab now as "ORomance Plus"
MCM option to use any kiss animation in kissing scenes over a curated list provided from Ostim Standalone.
  
* Options to show seduction value comparisons between player vs NPC
 added a Debug menu now which will show all active follower aliases for the ORomance quest. You can click "clear all aliases" to clear any NPCs who might be following you that you forgot about, or any NPCs that might have gotten stuck due to a script race condition and frozen in place via the ORomance "wait" package. This should hopefully alleviate the random cases when a NPC get's stuck in place.
  
* Spouses Tab to check your current list of spouses and a way to import the previous "lesser spouses" (from older ORomance Plus versions or mods that just slap on a playermarried faction onto the NPC) into the new ORomance Plus v2.0 spouse system to make them fully featured
Hotkeys no longer need a save/exit to desktop to be recognized, should be a lot less buggy
  
* Configurable hotkeys for accept key in the UI
Disable/Enable sound effects 
  
* There is now a MCM option to import vanilla relationship rank of 4 into the ORomance Plus system as a player partner (boyfriend/girlfriend, not spouse). This happens upon opening the ORomance UI on a NPC, as long as the MCM option is enabled
Harem charm perk toggle to disable, as mentoned above in the "Infidelity" section
  
* Difficulty slider in the MCM has a wider range now, from -500 to +500 to make it either much easier or much harder.
