This mod has one simple goal, which is to make the courier more immersive.
  
  
It accomplishes this by:
  
  

  
* Making the courier no longer essential
Adding multiple couriers; the courier is no longer just one person
  
* Expanding the races and sexes available that the courier can be
Expanding the existing dialog to feel less repetitive (planned)
  
* Replacing the courier if killed with a new courier
Allowing you to loot the courier to collect your parcels
  
* Creating a home office for the courier to return to after making a delivery
Allowing you to receive all letters in an inventory menu to easily see what you have received and read letters without digging through your inventory.
  
* Having the courier deliver mail to NPCs (you aren't the only person who receives mail)
Making delivery conditions to be more realistic.
  

  
How are deliver conditions made to be more realistic? The courier will only approach you if...
  
  

  
* It is between the hours of 6am and 6pm.
It is not Sundas.
  
* You are in an area with the "LocTypeHabitation" keyword
You are in Raven Rock (if on Solstheim)
  
* The courier has items to deliver
You are not in an orc stronghold.
  
* You are not at the College of Winterhold.
You are not in unusual places, other dimensions, or other plains of existence; Sovngarde, Forgotten Vale, Soul Cairn, or Apocrypha.
  
* You are not in an interior
You are not trespassing
  
* You are not in combat
You are not sneaking
  
* You are not using a spell with the "MagicInvisibility" keyword
You are not restrained
  

  
In addition to the above, when the courier is ready to make deliveries, it will be limited to once per day.
  
  
Better Courier was made to be compatible with [Skald's Mail](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31791) by [AlistairRodryk](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/53503711). Skald's Mail is optional, but recommended; in Skald Mail MCM, choose courier for important deliveries. Skald's Mail expands upon the in-game mail system.
  
  
Better Courier was also inspired by [Providential Courier Service](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10623) by [Arthmoor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/684492) and [Courier Shows Delivery](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/edit/?id=40709) by [stradivuckos](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/2151759). Since this mod's scripts modified the WICourier quest this would be in direct conflict with the changes made by Arthmoor; these mods are not compatible. I also used the same location for the home office to reduce conflicts with other mods. [Courier Stays In Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40931/) by [UltimateGaymer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/2735815) is also incompatible; Better Courier already has restrictive delivery logic.
  
  
Thanks to the (generously) open permissions of [Courier Delivers to NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42928) by [Pickysaurus](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/31179975), this feature has been fully integrated into Better Courier. Be sure to endorse his original work.
