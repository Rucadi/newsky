**[font=Georgia]INTRODUCTION[/font]**

  

This mod will bring a little immersion when fishing with the CC content.
  
The fishing rod is actually placed on the hands of your character and not just floating around. When a fish or object is caught, your character will pose with the prize, instead of that janky "fanfare" screen. Adds new animations for Casting the rod, Idling and Catching the fish/object.

So, just place it after all the mods that change this script in one way or another. A new save is recommended, but if you want to try on an existing save, just make sure to stay as far away as possible from fishing (after installing you can fish as you like).
  
  
This means that you don't need to install all the mods above, but if you want to use one, two, three or all the mods together, just load this mod after everything.
  
  
In the Fomod (installer options) there are also some patches for **Fishing Extension Framework** (to make **Line and Lure - Fishing Perks** and **Fish Anywhere with Water** work together). They're OPTIONAL and you only need them if using **FEF**(and one of the other mods above). Take a look at the Patches section when installing.
  
  
  
**[font=Georgia]Q&A[/font]**

**Q: Dynamic Animation Replacer?**
  
*A: I'm sorry, it won't work with DAR.*
  
  
**Q: Why use Simple Fishing Overhaul as a requirement?**
  
*A: It's a great mod and already adds all that's needed for this mod to work. Plus I don't need to create a new .esp just for this.*
  
  
**Q: Rod height?**
  
*A: With the power of Immersive Equipment Displays, the fishing rod is placed on your character's hand, so you don't need to worry about rod height or race changes anymore. It still might float a bit depending on the animation, as I couldn't time the fishing rod's animation with the character's animation properly, but that's good enough for me.*
  
  
**Q: First person?**
  
*A: Animations are meant for third person, but can work in first person with Improved Camera.*
  
  
**Q: But...?**
  
*A: If you don't play in third person, don't use Open Animation Replacer, don't use Immersive Equipment displays or play in VR, then this mod is pointless for you.*
