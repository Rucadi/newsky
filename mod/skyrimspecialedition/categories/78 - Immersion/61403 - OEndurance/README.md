With OEndurance going fast in OStim scenes now drains your stamina. Animations in the upper half of the speed options will cost stamina, increasing the higher you go. The stamina cost is depending on the scene class, e.g. a penetration scene will drain your stamina faster than a handjob scene. The cost usually applies to the leading actor of the scene (this is usually the male for penetration scenes, the female for handjob scenes, etc.), but some scene classes also drain part of the inactive partners stamina, too.
  
If the leading partner runs low on stamina the animation will automatically slow down to a speed option that is not fast paced (in the lower half of the speed options), so that the actors can regenerate some stamina.
  
  
Combining this with Wet Function Redux will make your character get more sweaty the longer you go, if that's your kind of thing.
  
  
As of version 2.0 all stamina cost values are derived from OStims action files (data\SKSE\plugins\OStim\actions), so if you don't like them you can change it in those files.
