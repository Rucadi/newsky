**This is a 'PG' version of my my mod [Collision Dialogue Overhaul](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/132325)﻿
  
  
Why a new version? Some people may want a tamer version without some of the coarser language. Plus the mod should now fit the requirements to be uploaded for XBox users. Use only one version of the mod.**
  
  
Are you bored with the same old comments when you run into NPCs? 'Hey! Watch it!' and 'What's the hurry?!' type stuff?
  
  
If so, this is the mod for you. It adds loads of new dialogue for when you are sprinting and collide with NPCs.
  
  
**Brief Overview**
  
  

  
* Around 400 new voice lines
Covers most vanilla voice types, some DLC voice types and several unique NPCs
  
* Comments for frontal collision and rear collision
Comments based on player's race and gender
  
* Configurable with console commands
Special scene if you bump into the Jarl
  

  
**Mod Details**
  
  
More or less all vanilla voice types are included (child voices are not), plus the extra Dark Elf voices from Dragonborn. Some unique NPCs are also included, namely, Delvin Mallory, Mirabelle Ervine and Karliah. I've tried to make the comments lore friendly and to fit the 'personality' of the voice type. For example the Condescending voices will be condescending, the High Elf voices will be haughty, the Nords will have more 'racist' comments, the Female Sultry voice will be more flirtatious. I've also researched some Medieval type insults and added these.
  
  
Some NPCs will also have their own unique lines. Some lines will be unique to certain locations, like innkeepers might threaten to throw you out, shopkeepers will comment that you're in their shop, etc.
  
  
NPCs will make different comments depending on the direction of the bump. If you bump them from behind, they'll have different comments. If you bump them from the front they'll tell you to get out of their face and similar comments. There are also new generic comments regardless of the direction.
  
  
They will also recognise your race and gender and make comments accordingly. Some are more racist in their comments, particularly Nords against everyone, Argonians against Khajiits and the other way round.
  
  
Jarls have a bonus scene, if you bump into them (sprint) they'll sometimes make a comment that will trigger a scene where their Housecarl or Steward will tell the guards and the guards will react with their own lines. This is purely cosmetic, it doesn't actually make the guards arrest you or anything.
  
  
**Configuring the Mod**
  
  
I realise that not all aspects of the mod will be to everyone's taste so I've provided options to disable the following parts using console commands.
  
  

  
* Directional comments. Use the console command setjb1cdodirection to 0
Racist comments. Use the console command setjb1cdorace to 0
  

  
Regarding the content, the racist comments are in line with what's already in the game and not extreme. The NSFW comments have been removed in this version of the mod. The aim here is for humour, not to be offensive. See the video for examples.
  
  
**Installation**
  
Simply install like you would any other mod using your favourite mod manager. Should be safe to install mid-game.
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
Should be compatible with pretty much anything. Nothing vanilla has been edited and everything is handled by dialogue conditions. If you have mods that reduce the frequency or distance of NPC comments this may cause issues. Place this mod lower (higher priority in your load order) than other mods that affect NPC dialogue.
  
  
**Immersive Citizens** was tested with the mod (as this does reduce NPC comments) and is compatible.
  
**To My Face** has also been tested with no issues, as has **No NPC Greetings.**
  
  
**FAQs / Comments**
  
The mod is ESL flagged so it won't take up a spot in your load order. It has been cleaned and checked for errors in xEdit.
  
  
Please note that you have to SPRINT into NPCs to trigger the dialogue, as in, hold shift and run into them at full speed.
  
  
The more racist comments are blocked from current followers and NPCs with a relationship rank with the player of Friend or higher.
  
  
The comments are set to not repeat for at least 3 hours.
  
  
Mod-added NPCs that use vanilla voice types will automatically be included.
  
  
**Does it work with AE?**
  
The mod was made with the older version of the Creation Kit so it's compatible with all versions of Skyrim SE/AE.
  
  
**Can you add some more insults that I think are good?**
  
Probably not.
  
  
**Waaaugghh! I don't like 'AI' voices !!!**
  
Don't use the mod.
