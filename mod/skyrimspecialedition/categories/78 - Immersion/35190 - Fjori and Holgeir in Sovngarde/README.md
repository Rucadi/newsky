# Fjori and Holgeir in Sovngarde

This small immersion mod adds Fjori and Holgeir to Sovngarde after you meet their ghosts in the Ansilvund dungeon.
  
  
**This mod is compatible with the latest version of Skyrim (AE or SE).**
  
  
**Note**: If you see script file conflicts between any of my other mods, don't worry about it. They use identical copies of the same script, which causes Vortex/MO2 to see it as a conflict. You can let them overwrite each other in any order. 
  
  
Fjori and Holgeir were Nord folk-heroes, and based on the book they were great warriors as well. So they certainly deserve to be in Sovngarde alongside other legends!
  
  
I decided to put them in the mead hall rather than trapped in the mist because their situation is similar to Olaf One-eye. You can find Olaf in Skyrim as a draugr, but he is found in the mead hall. By my head canon, Fjori and Holgeir had died eons ago, and therefore had already made their way to Sovngarde's hall. This would allow them to manifest in order to thank you for freeing their misused corpses without requiring them to return through the mist and get trapped by Alduin like the newly dead souls. 
  
  
This mod should work fine when added mid-playthrough. It is an esl-flagged esp, and should not conflict with anything. Load before lighting mods such as ELFX if you want to keep their changes. Make sure to actually leave Ansilvund using Lu'ah's key, or else the Ansilvund Quest may not complete properly to trigger Fjori and Holgeir. 
  
  
I had the idea for this mod a long while ago, but I plan on including it in a collection alongside [New Embershard Miners﻿](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35031)﻿ to add population to Skyrim as you clear dungeons and create a more dynamically changing world. May release some more small stand-alone changes while working toward the bigger release!
