# Apocryphal Library and Undeath Remastered Integration

**VERSION 1.2 OF THIS MOD will only work with VERSION 1.2 of APOCRYPHAL LIBRARY
  
Version 1 will work with all versions!**
  
  
This mod adds a fully-readable version of 'Whispers of the Veil', the Black Book from [Undeath Remastered](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6180), to that mod's Apocrypha dungeon - just next to the book activator at the end of the dungeon. ESL flagged, let me know if something isn't working!
  
  
It also adds a [Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805) \_SWAP.INI file to carry over the same changes from [Apocryphal Library.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/121654?tab=posts) All the small book stacks and piles of paper in Undeath's Apocrypha dungeon will be changed to the ones from my mod. If you don't want to use that mod, delete the \_SWAP.INI file (unless you're not using BOS in which case you don't have to). 
  
  
The book in this mod was written based on the first page text from the Black Book - Whispers of the Veil, and expands that book to cover all the information added by the 'Ritual Notes' added in Undeath. It contains a chant for the ritual (flavour only) made from a butchered mess of Aldmeris, Ehlnofex and Ayleidoon. Good luck if you want to translate it, you don't have to! If you really want to know, check the bottom of this description.
  
  
Note: You can only get to Apocrypha in Undeath Remastered by choosing the evil lich path. There is, at current, no way of getting this book as a good guy unless you use console commands. Type:
  

```
help "whispers of the veil"
```

  
to find the right id. 
  
  
**VERSION NOTES:**
  
  
Version 1.0 swaps for the same containers and levelled lists as the ones in Apocrypha, and will work with any version of that mod.
  
Version 1.2 only works with V1.2 of Apocryphal Library, as it uses new containers and lists placed in that version. 
  
  
The actual difference: The containers and lists in V1.2 contain books more focused on Necromancy rather than more general tomes. There will be a few general books as well. The spell tomes will be drawn more from Conjuration, Destruction and Restoration rather than all five schools, with Conjuration being the most common. This only applies to book stacks, the piles of papers are untouched.
  
  
If you would prefer to have the same availability of books as Apocrypha, use the older version! The new version give you any books that the old version doesn't have, it just makes the Necromancy books more available.
  
  
  
**Requires:**
  
  
Undeath Remastered (mandatory)
  
Apocryphal Library (not strictly mandatory, but the only change will be the new placed book)
  
Base Object Swapper (in order for Apocryphal Library to work)
  
  
**Recommended Mods:**
  
  
These mods are good for a Necromancer playthrough, and the books new to V1.2 of Apocryphal Library may hint towards some of the practices:
  
[Your Soul Is Mine](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30881) - Lets you consume black soul gems to gain power
  
[Soul Salts](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14043) - Lets you grind up soul gems and make new ones or other cool things
  
[Practical Necromancy (formerly The Dark Arts)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29834) - The ultimate necromancer mod, lets you raise armies of permanent minions of all kinds, and more!
  
[Flesh Atronachs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77868) - It is necromancy if you're using living tissue? Stay tuned
  
[Clean Up Your Corpses](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24026) - Hold onto some useful dead bodies so that you can raise them later!
  
[Grave Digging - Necromancy Addon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/129204) - Some good old-fashioned Resurrection-Men style grave robbing

If you want to know the translation of the elven in the book, look here! If you want to translate it yourself for some reason, don't look! It's a very shaky translation because the languages in TES aren't exactly well explained but here's what I came up with. 
  
  
> ﻿"I do not fear death. Forbidden darkness is a weapon against the mortal gods, death is the secret of life, secret wisdom is the path to eternal power. I unbind my soul, against god-law I limit my soul to this enduring stone. By this forbidden symbol I grant half-life upon my soul. By this power I bring true change."
