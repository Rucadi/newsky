For a retexture of the books, look no further than anything adding texture to Apocrypha, like this one (highly recommended!):

No navmesh. No collisions. Safe to install mid-game. Comes with a fomod that chooses your patches based on your load order. It just works, as Todd intended!
  
  
This mod was highly inspired by one of my all-time favorite mods: [Immersive Magic Brooms](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74847). It also inspired the name of my own mod, and they both work and look great together! Be sure to download for even more \*magic\* in areas around Skyrim.
