Pets of Skyrim wasn't what I had in mind when making Voiced Narrative, but I recently noticed it adds a permanent resident named Halvar to Rorikstead, who also unsurprisingly, has nothing to say despite having an established personality in a quest note. After hanging around Rorikstead long enough with that guy staring blankly into my soul, I decided to do him some favors by creating new greeting dialogue and replaced his generic responses when selling Hilda the goat with unique lines, all based on existing notes from the content and voiced through ElevenLabs. It's not much, but that’s one less soulless husk in Skyrim.

**FAQ:**
  
**Is this ESL-flagged (ESPFE)?**
  
Yes.
  
  
**Is this compatible with Unofficial Skyrim Creation Club Content Patches?**
  
Yes.
  
**[b]I noticed some grammar errors and thought a few lines could be improved?**
  
[/b]I'm always open to any feedback on improving dialogue and grammar**,**but please provide helpful feedback over one-liner criticism.
  
**Is this compatible with my face overhaul mod that change the same NPCs from this mod?**
  
Yes, it only changes dialogue records, NPCs are left intact.
  
  
**Will this break my save?**
  
This mod mainly edited dialogue records that already existed. It's safe to install mid game; removing it will just revert everything back to vanilla lines.**[size=5][b]If you like this mod, check out my Voiced Narrative series**[![](https://i.imgur.com/fbGwAOH.png)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67053)﻿[![](https://i.imgur.com/o14dXRl.png)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67117)﻿﻿
