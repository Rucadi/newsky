Isobel, from Interesting NPCs is an adorable apprentice blacksmith and one of my favorite characters to romance.  Base game doesn't include any ability for her to smith for you but Honed Metal allows you to add her to a framework that covers this.  Unfortunately, her Honed Metal dialogue responses are unvoiced.  However, since Isobel already has a wealth of blacksmithing dialogue, I added in appropriate responses so she can speak with you again.  With Anduniel's permission.
  
  
Voiced lines were not spliced or AI edited and are simply appropriate copies of her vanilla lines.  Some of her lines contain romantic talk but I conditioned her not to use them unless you were in relationship rank 4.  But this happens after your first date and I don't know how to condition it to marriage only.
  
  
Also, my first uploaded mod.  Yay!
  
  
Update: I didn't realize how intrusive this mod is with Honed Metal.  Since Isobel has a different voice type and dialogue, I have to modify Honed Metal's records not to include her in vanilla responses.  But this means any updates to Honed Metal that changes those dialogues will have to be forwarded over =(.
