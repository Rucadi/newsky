**~ Greetings and Welcome! You are currently on the Skyrim SE/AE side of the Nexus. ~
  
  
Denizens of Morthal** is a dialogue and character expansion for the residents of the hold capital Morthal. It changes the schedules of the characters and allows them to converse with each other. It also acts as an overhaul for characters with ties to the area, namely Benor, Erandur, Valdimar, Eisa Blackthorn and Meeko.
  
  
This mod adds around 173 carefully spliced and synth-free NPC-to-NPC conversations. Most of these take place in Morthal, but some conversations are for specific characters to converse with each other (usually involving Benor, Eisa, Valdimar and Erandur), and their connections to other people in different locations, so be sure to take those four on your travels!

**For Best Results:**I urge you to install Denizens before you begin a new game. Since it edits NPCs (especially their schedules), includes a couple of Start Game Enabled quests, and adds a few objects here and there (be sure to peruse the Edited Locations List linked to under the Deeper Details section), Denizens is not a mod to be installed if you are already in the process of playing a game.
  
  
In addition, use the [EZ2c Dialogue Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/18466)﻿, or if you cannot find it, get the [Minimal Oblivion Dialogue Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46812)﻿ instead.
  
  
Why?
  
  
Denizens' dialogue is uncapped. This means that many of the dialogue responses exceed the default letter limit put in place by Bethesda for both the Player and NPC responses (meaning that the responses tend to be longer and more detailed). The latter (for NPC responses) should not cause trouble, but depending on what other dialogue mods you have installed (and the length of their own responses) some of the Player's dialogue may only show up sporadically. Using one of the mods listed above should help mitigate the issue.
  
  
Make sense? If not, that's okay! Click [this article](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/6468) if you want an example.

**Required Mods:**Denizens requires no master files at this time. However, if you wish to be able to recruit Eisa as a follower, you will need a mod like Relationship Dialogue Overhaul to affect this.
  
  
If you use RDO, make sure to load Denizens below it. I am slowly crafting my own personal dialogue overhaul mod,  but I dare not speculate on when--or even if--it will be made available.
  
  
Denizens was originally created using the Unofficial Skyrim Legendary Edition Patch (USLEP). Though it no longer requires it as a master file, it incorporates several changes from the patch for similarly edited sections in the Creation Kit. It also includes a few scripts and NPC packages to keep it compatible and to avoid breaking any fixes. For this, I thank the Unofficial Patch Team for the understanding clauses in their permissions that allow this to take place.
  
  
Please note that though Meeko has two conversations with Benor, that this mod does not make any changes to how often Meeko barks. You can still use other mods to reduce barking.If you use a mod that changes how dogs sound when barking, just remember that Meeko's custom conversations were made with the vanilla-game dog sounds.
  
  
**Special Note** for users of Mod Managers - December 1, 2025: It has come to my attention that my ongoing battle with the Nexus search engine may be contributing to CTDs (crashes to desktop), by way of additions made to Denizens' title back in 2023. Please see the commenting-focused sticky post in the comments section, which now includes critical information courtesy of SiJin.
  
  
I do not know quite yet what I am going to do about this, what with the quick search still not being graced with the ability to pick up keywords (such as names and places) in mod descriptions. Denizens of Morthal (DoM) is a hybrid mod of sorts, which makes this a challenging issue to deal with. I also have its successor (DoHF) to think about, which is even more of a hybrid mod than DoM is currently. Oy vey.
  
  
**Patches, Load-Order, Compatibility Notices & Known Issues:**It is inevitable that Denizens will edit characters and locations touched on by other mods. If you wish to make a compatibility patch for the characters or any areas that I have edited that present conflicts, then please feel free to do so. Please take a look at the Permissions tab for further details. I would hope the fact that I am very pro-patch is quite clear by now. If you prefer another creator's interpretation of any of the characters that I have edited or expanded, then you are more than welcome to create a patch to block out my dialogue additions.
  
  
If you want to help make more patches a reality, then Endorse the mod and spread the word. Trust me on this--once Denizens of Hjaalmarch hits, patch creators will definitely be needed. 
  
  
Also, please remember that I play and construct my mods on the LE version of Skyrim. You cannot look to me to create patches related to SE or AE.

**The following spoiler will lead to information about arranging your Load-Order:**
  
SpoilerLoad Denizens below mods like Relationship Dialogue Overhaul and any other mods that edit NPC schedules (like Immersive Citizens). Load Denizens above any mods that edit lighting or water.
  
  
If you are running any Civil War related mods, check your load order with xEdit. Denizens ticks the box to allow conversations between certain guards, and consequently, that may cause a conflict with certain CW mods. Solution: If possible, load your CW mods below Denizens, and make sure to forward the Conversations flag for any AI Packages that show up as problematic.
  
  
If you have any appearance overhauls running, you will need to forward Denizens' changes through, especially the AI Packages.
  
  
**The following spoiler will explain why this mod edits NPC Appearances:**
  
Spoiler For the most part, that is just a side effect of how the Creation Kit works. Editing one little thing on an NPC counts as a whole character edit, unfortunately. However, as with most passion projects, Denizens started off (and remains to this day) a personal mod. So the appearence changes you see in Benor, Eisa, Valdimar and Erandur are very much deliberate. For Eisa especially, I wanted to make sure that she looked related to a *certain pair of sisters* as they appear in my favourite child overhaul mod: [Simple Children](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/96196)﻿ by Tetchystar.
  
  
I also went on a lengthy and somewhat nerve-racking permission gathering spree for Denizens (and even its sibling mod, because I like to plan far ahead and do not appreciate being blind-sighted when creators vanish without a trace), so availing myself to those hard-won permissions is very much on my priority list.
  
  
I intend to keep my deliberate appearance changes limited strictly to Anchor Characters as much as possible, though, which is a role that Benor and the other three fill with aplomb. If you decide to keep Denizens' deliberate appearance changes, they will use whatever skin you have installed, so there is no need to worry about anything funky happening in that direction. For the skin shown in the screenshots, the men use Vitruvia and the women use Bejin, albeit with a customized face texture (every lady having the exact same configuration of moles on their faces really started to weird me out.)
  
  
**The following spoiler cover Compatibility Notices:**SpoilerJanuary 18, 2023: There will eventually be an article created for this very subject once I get my eyes back, but until then...
  
  
There has been a reported incompatibility concerning **Requiem 5.2.3** and the **Denizens of Morthal Finding Helgi Patch** that was created by Laptoprocker. For full details, please visit the comments section and read the post by Keypuncher.
  
  
Edit: Apparently a fix for this can be found on the Requiem discord server! Keypuncher's latest post has the sweet deets. Also, greetings and thanks to Waeq17, who told Keypuncher, who then told me. You both are the bee's knees. :D
  
  
If you are using **Headhunter Bounties Redone**, be aware that Elite Guards (click [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/4633) for more information about them) are *very* passionate about slaying bandits and other undesirables, hence the word "Elite".
  
  
This means that if they spot what they consider to be an enemy (even if that enemy is not yet hostile) they will attack and smite them without a second thought. Their fervor may even inspire more laid-back (default) guards to join their cause and take part in the fight.
  
  
It's purely a matter of their custom Elite Guard faction being set to enemies with all sorts of ne'er-do-wells in order for them to be more efficient at their jobs. However, if you bring one of their enemies into their radius as part of a bounty collection, the guards may slaughter your prisoner before you get a chance to turn them in. A slight change in xEdit can help prevent this from happening. For further options and detail, visit the comments section and look for my response (1/18/2023) to Richardorge.

Pertaining to content from the **Creation Club** (CC): As noted before, I am a Skyrim LE player and creator, so content from the Creation Club is neither supported nor acknowledged. That said, I always appreciate reports about conflicts so that I can at least forewarn others.
  
  
One such valued report concerns the Elite Guards (present in DoM versions 1.0 - 1.5) attacking Creation Club **pets**.
  
  
As of  11/18/25, I do not know the exact particulars, so which "pets" are being attacked and why I dare not speculate, but CC users should have a care if they travel with said pets into Morthal or Whiterun.

While on the subject of the CC, I understand that the **giant crab** featured in the infamous Bethesda Game Jam from 2011 managed to get itself repurposed for some CC content linked to **fishing**.
  
  
The encounter with it takes place somewhere outside of Dawnstar on the coast. Denizens utilizes part of the coast as an area linked to both Erandur and Eisa Blackthorn's enhanced schedules, so I made a rare exception and attempted to figure out if this caused compatibility issues.
  
  
After scanning many blurry screenshots and watching numerous unfocused videos (folks, you can stare at your player character all you like on your own time, so if you're making a video specifically about the fishing quest, keep the focus on the actual fishing), I am about 95% certain that there should no conflicts with the area. *Yay.* 
  
  
**The following spoiler will talk about Known Issues:**
  
SpoilerEisa, despite having a heated conversation that can occur with Delphine, can still be made a Blade. The bane of my existence, this is. Nothing I've tried works to remove her from becoming a Blade. I will keep trying.
  
  
Eisa may become stuck in Sibbi's jail cell in Riften. I really have no idea why she sometimes teleports in there. She should catch up with you once you leave the prison, though.
  
  
Conversations involving more than two NPCs behave differently. The first two actors who interact with each other seem to do just fine, but the other actors involved in the same conversation make take part in it from afar, or be moving about while interacting with the others at some distance. This is also visible in vanilla dialogue scenes, such as the one in the Blue Palace that involves Falk Firebeard, Bryling and Sybille Stentor, where the first two will speak in the main chamber of the palace, but Sybille will chime in while sleeping on her bed--her replies hardly audible. I am still looking into ways to prevent this from happening.
  
  
No one is talking. This is a vanilla game issue. NPCs simply won't speak to each other. It may have something to do with the growing size of a save file or just due to Skyrim being Skyrim. It can start up again without any warning. My advice is to just lose yourself in the game and let it come back naturally, though sometimes Waiting or relaunching the game to re-load a save file can kick it back into gear. (I had such a *glorious* time trying to test new dialogue with this. Yes, that was sarcasm.)
  
  
Lore notice: I had to make an educated guess as to when the news of Torygg's death reached Morthal.
  
  
Role-play notice: The player mentions escaping Helgen during the introduction to Valdimar. This will no longer be an issue once the Hjaalmarch Edition releases.
  
  
If you are running Immersive Citizens, you might wish to disable the weather modules for the Hjaalmarch and Pale areas. Otherwise, you might be wondering why no one ever seems to leave their homes.

**Future Plans:**In a word, *complicated.* The majority of my attention for the last couple of years has been focused on *Denizens of Hjaalmarch* (DoH), which started off as a simple update to Denizens of Morthal (DoM), but grew so much that it was planned to be a new release.
  
  
Before the simple update to DoM grew into DoH, however, construction began on a sibling mod (Kindred Spirits), which (to save esp slots) aimed to cover the other eight holds of Skyrim, the island where Castle Volkihar is located, as well as Solstheim.
  
  
Over the course of time, certain (at first strictly Hjaalmarch-related) content from Kindred Spirits starting being transferred directly to DoH. As I worked more on both the dialogue and quests of transferred content, though, it became expedient to bring across select content related to Winterhold, the Pale, and a few other areas as well.
  
  
  
  
Long story short (too late), the title of Denizens of Hjaalmarch has become **Denizens of Holds Forgotten (DoHF)**, a dialogue and quest expansion, as well as a town overhaul of the holds of Hajaalmarch, Winterhold, the Pale and Falkreath.
  
  
The town overhaul aspects mostly involve an extension of territory to provide space for additional homes, businesses, and quest locations. It is being designed in a way to make it fairly easy to patch out aspects which conflict with other overhaul mods, while still giving the capitals and their settlements a fresh coat of paint and providing a lore-friendly boost to show how they actually provide for themselves.
  
  
As of **November 20, 2025**, Dawnstar is rapidly catching up with Morthal and Stonehills in terms of modification. Morthal itself has claimed a greater share of its natural territory and has its own performance-friendly aesthetic and colour scheme. *Falion's Secret* (the unfinished and somewhat buggy vanilla quest) has been expanded yet again to augment the changes to the town. *Laid to Rest* is next on my list to receive similar treatment, so expect what you do in these quests to have consequences that can be both seen and felt.
  
  
At the end of the day, I am just a girl trying to fight her demons with the weapon known as modding. My depression roils and swells, and lately I find it very easy to lose motivation. Denizens is the one thing I always come back to, though, which is why I intend to give it my best—no matter how long it may take to do it.
