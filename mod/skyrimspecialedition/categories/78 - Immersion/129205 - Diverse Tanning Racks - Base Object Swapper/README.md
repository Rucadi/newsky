First up, a HUGE thankyou to [renthal311](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5851384) for allowing me to use their assets in this mod. Please be sure to give them some kudos!
  
  
This is a Base Object Swapper mod that adds thirty two variant tanning racks to Skyrim. There are seven frame types each with between three and seven variants. You'll see people tanning different leathers and different pelts. In towns, the racks remain that same but the pelts are randomly swapped on save load. In the wild, any of the variants may appear as these feel like they are more temporary and would change.

Installation.
  
  
1) Make sure you have [Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805) installed.
  
2) Install this mod. If you have my More Realistic Antlers or Better Pelts and Hides mods installed, you'll be asked to overwrite some textures. That's okay as they're duplicates.
  
3) Travel around and check out the new tanning racks! Enjoy!
