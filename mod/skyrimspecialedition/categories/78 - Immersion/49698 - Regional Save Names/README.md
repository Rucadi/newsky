**Description**
  
  

  
* ﻿Interior saves listed the name of cell you were in, but you'd see "Skyrim" for all exterior saves. This was fixed by Unique Region Names in LE.
For reasons unknown, Bethesda changed how save naming works in SSE, and saves would no longer display the region they were saved in.
  
* This SKSE plugin reverts that change, meaning you can have regional save names again.
