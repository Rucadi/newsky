This mod overhauls the legendary Ebony Warrior bossfight from vanilla Skyrim.﻿﻿
  
  
Adding a few more abilities to EW's arsenal, alongside new **unique** equipment.
  
Also while adding a few juicy little lore references for those in the know.
  
A fitting prize for the premise of a 'Final Duel'.
  
  
"What if you could fight somebody that was strong but still felt human?"
  
  
As such, he hits like a truck, with a lot of crowd control abilites
  
 as a measure against getting stunlocked by a gang of followers.
  
His BASH attack will create a whirlwind AOE that deals stagger damage
  
to the player and NPCs.
  
  
Health sits at around 2500. While blocking, his shield can heal him.
  
So it's best to keep on the offensive with power attacks, not giving him a chance to recover.
