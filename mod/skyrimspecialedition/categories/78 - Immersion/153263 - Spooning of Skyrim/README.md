? “It’s not weird unless you narrate it.”
  
Welcome to **Spooning of Skyrim** — definitely not the first and probably not the last mod to ask, *"What if your follower also wanted to lie down sometimes?"*
  
Inspired by the wonderful **Double Beds for Spooning** by Giamel. I loved that mod, I still do, but I wanted something that didn’t require mesh edits, didn't care if your bed was made of straw or stone, and that I could adjust on the fly.
  
So I made this.
  
It’s spooning. It’s simple. It’s stupidly customisable. Snuggle responsibly folks.
  
[line]?️ **Features**:
  
Works with any bed – singles, doubles, those slab-of-marble things at High Hrothgar
  
Works with any bedroll – including ones added by BOS and other modders (via patching or Formlist Manipulator)
  
Position editing in MCM – shove your spooner left, right, forwards, backwards, or straight through the floor if you're into that
  
Choose whether your spooning companion enters the bed from the left, right, or whichever side they feel like ruining your immersion from
  
Debug mode: see the invisible bed the NPC uses and adjust it perfectly (or just stare at it and question your life choices. my life choices.)
  
[line]? **How to Use**:
  
You’re granted a power on game load: **“Set Spooning Partner”**
  
Target an NPC and use the power on them. Boom. You’re bed buddies now.
  
Use the same power again to unselect them, in case things get awkward. Maybe they don't like Sam Raimi films like you do.
  
Head to the MCM to fine-tune their spooning position like a deranged interior decorator.
  
[line]?️ **How it Works**:
  
The mod listens for the bed entry/bedroll entry animation events from the player.
  
Once you lie down, an invisible bed is spawned at your location with your chosen offsets.
  
Your chosen NPC is ordered to go use that bed. They do. They don’t really have brains.
  
You now have co-sleeping storytelling gameplay mechanics.™
  
[line]? **Compatibility**:
  
Compatible with all vanilla beds and bedrolls
  
Compatible with all vanilla beds and bedrolls replacers
  
Compatible with **Double Beds for Spooning** – no need to uninstall it unless you want to. Your spooner will use the invisible bed and AI package from this mod, but even if they don’t, you got spooned either way, what do you care.
  
Mods that add new beds (through BOS usually) will need patching (either via an ESL or Formlist Manipulator ini).
  
An FLM.ini is included for some of my favorite BOS-compatible beds.
  
You can request others. I like beds. I collect them. Like pokemon.
  
Compatible with DAR/OAR spooning animation replacers – but you may need to tweak positioning.
  
**Use Those Blankets** is semi-compatible – you will get a blanket, your spoonee will not. I'll try and make a patch when I have the time/energy.
  
**Auto Sleep for Me Now** / **Sleep for Me Now** – compatible but this mod will override that behaviour.
  
**Campfire Spooning** – compatible and recommended since my mod doesn't cover the Campfire bedrolls
  
**Campfire - Immersive Snuggling** – as above

[line]? **Update Highlights**
  

  
* Fixed an animation event that was not being unregistered and caused Papyrus log spam.
Updated the FLM.ini to include more BOS-compatible beds.
  
* You can now spoon with **up to three partners**. Cycle through all three in the MCM. May your bed be warm and your throuples emotionally stable.

[line]❓ **FASQ – Frequently Asked Spooning Questions**
  
**Q: Why is it called Spooning Of Skyrim?**
  
A: coz wSkeever doesn’t own that (he probably does, stay tuned for my grovelling apology) and *Scripted Overnight Spooner* sounded like a euphemism.
  
**Q: My spooner won't share a child's bed with me!**
  
A: That’s by design — children’s beds are excluded. No snuggles in tiny beds. Get a grown-up mattress, you pagan.
  
**Q: I can't set my pet/child to spoon with me!**
  
A: Yeah, that’s intentional. Children are off-limits for spooning (forever). As for pets... maybe I’ll do a patch later for animals hogging the bed. Until then, give your pupper a hug with something like *Immersive Interactions*.
  
**Q: Is [insert mod here] compatible with this?**
  
A: Probably? Maybe? I have nfi. It’s a spooning mod. And I already had to do some kinda complex trigonometry to make it work. My interest in patching it with the whole of Nexus is zilch.
  
[line]❤️ **Shoutouts**
  
Huge love to Giamel for **Double Beds for Spooning** — this mod is an homage. Giamel made all my favorites.
  
Thank you to all of my lovely friends in the Kaidan - Immersive Features server for testing this. I would have ended up with bedrolls at a 180 degree offset without you.
  
of Nexus is zilch.
  
[line]**Optional OAR Bedroll Animations**
  
  
These animations are **completely** optional. I had them already, and thought I would be nice and share.
  
  
- Bedroll spooning animations for the player and Slot A NPC, but only when that slot is actively snuggling. If the Slot is cleared, you will use whatever you already had for bedroll animations.
  
- Designed with a smaller player character and a larger spooner in mind. If your setup is different, expect a little clipping—you might like that though, idk.
  
- Adjust positioning with the MCM offsets for Slot A if needed. Your mileage may vary. Keep in mind offsets will apply to beds as well.
  
- I will not accept feedback on these unless its a compliment, you can still use the main mod without these, or with any other DAR/OAR animations. 
  
**Q: More animations? Beds? More variations for bedrolls?**
  
A: Maybe. I'd like to do some bed animations when I find time. For now, you get what I rigged in Blender at 2am after 4 beers. 
  
**Q: Why is there an ESP with an OAR file?**
  
A: yeh i know. the thing is, the animations look really dumb unless someone is there with you. So I added a perk to the player if they have a spooner partner in Slot A and remove it when they get up. That way if you're not spooning with anyone, you dont look stupid. you might still look stupid, but it wont be related to me.
