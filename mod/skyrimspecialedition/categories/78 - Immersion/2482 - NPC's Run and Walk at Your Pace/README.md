Tired of following Delphine only to find yourself constantly stopping to wait for her to catch up? Annoyed with trying to follow Hadvar or Raloph after escaping Helen only to find yourself constantly getting ahead of them? Tired of trying to walk with an npc only to have to switch to a jog to keep up?
  
  
 Well then this mod is for you!
  
  
This mod changes the walk and running speed of all npcs to that of the player. This is accomplished by simply changing some global speed values that NPCs use. Therefore every and any NPC in game or added from a mod will be affected by this mod! Now they can keep up with you when running (not sprinting ) and you can keep up with them when walking. Thus solving the issue of waiting for npcs to catch up if you haven't been sprinting and making it far less irritating to follow another npc. This also helps with followers not keeping up. As long as you don't sprint you'll find that your followers will still be behind you after a long journey.
  
  
**This mod will fit seamlessly into any play through! Enable or disable this mod at anytime!**
  
  
  
This mod doesn't use any scripts and should be compatible with *any* mod as long as it doesn't do the same thing. However any mod that changes the speed of the player in any permanent way will negate the effect of this mod since it changes npc speeds to where it mimics the players vanilla speed. Load order doesn't matter but if you want to be extra careful place this near the bottom.
  
  
Please note, for whatever reason you may experience issues sprinting when using a Playstation controller or in rarer cases an xbox controller, however if you are playing with a controller you don't really need this mod since you can adjust your pace with your control stick already.
