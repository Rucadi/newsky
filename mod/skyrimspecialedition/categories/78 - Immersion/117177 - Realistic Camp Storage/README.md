Main Mod

  
  
This mod adds a variety of new containers under the Create Item power to add to the camping experience.
  
  
Survival Additions: 
  
\* Blacksmith Crate  (4 Firewood, requires steel smithing)
  
\* Food sack   (2 Linen Wrap)
  
\* Alchemist pouch (2 Leather)
  
\* Satchel  (2 Leather).
  
  
This also adds a variety of larger containers and kegs to the Forge (requires steel smithing, firewood and iron ingots)
  
\* Ornate Chest
  
\* Noble Chest
  
\* Strong Box
  
\* Small Chest
  
\* Ale Barrel
  
  
The mod also makes it so when you pick up your container, the carry weight of the container is adjusted by the weight of its contents.
  
  

Wildlander Patch

Includes OCF Framework Keyword distributor, to use I4 Icons provided by Aura's Inventory tweaks
  
  
Patches recipes so that only one of each container type (including the original ones from Simple Bedrolls and Supplies - for Campfire) is creatable. 
  
  
Separated the Simple Bedrolls and Supplies so that both the barrel and the chest have separate inventory.
  

Requiem Patch

  
This patch makes the Ammunition items add weights based on requiem's weight. Wildlander users need this patch as well. 
  
  
  

Enderchest Patch

Includes OCF Framework Keyword distributor, to use I4 Icons provided by Aura's Inventory tweaks
  
  
Patches recipes so that only one of each container type is craftable (note: if adding mid-playthough, and you have already crafted one of the chests you will be able to craft a second as this mod can only count items crafted after installation) 
  
  
Wildlander users dont need this.
  
  

Simple Bedrolls and Supplies - for Campfire Patch

  
Patches Simple Bedrolls and Supplies - for Campfire (old rim mod) chest and barrel so they are separate containers, use this mods restrictions and applies the Enderchest patch to these containers. 
  
  
Wildlander users dont need this.
