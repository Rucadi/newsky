**Description**
  
  
Shortly before I made this mod, someone messaged me about housecarls and how they just pop into existance the moment you become Thane.
  
  
Since I made mods like this before, I was asked to adress the housecarls and give them an actual life before becoming your housecarl. You will meet them in inns, markets, Jarl longhouses, etc, living their life, aspiring to be a housecarl someday...
  
  
As of v2.0, this is done by using a duplicated NPC that uses the standard housecarls as templates. As such, they will inherit their appearance, equipment and stats. Then, I used the opposite enable status of the Vanilla housecarls, which means the pre-housecarl NPCs will be disabled, as soon as the actual housecarls become available. This should make revoiced overhauls more compatible.
  
  
Note on updating from v1.0-v1.1 to v2.0: While I took great care to ensure upgrading is as flawless as possible, there might still be some bugs. My apologies for those, in advance.
  
  
Huge credit goes to [saiska](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/saiska/about-me?gameId=1704) for their mod, [Free Housecarls](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27571), which I used a lot of AI Packages from.
  
  
The following (aspiring) housecarls are adressed:

**Compatibility**
  
  
This time around, I have made no direct edits to NPCs, so all NPC appearance mods should be compatible.
  
  
However, certain mods that change dialogue for housecarls, like revoicing them, might be incompatible/inconsistent.
  
  
I made patches for:
  
  

  
* [Simple Winterhold Housecarl](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/127474)
[A Proper Thane for Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40290)
  

  
**FAQ**
  
  
Q: ESPFE?
  
A: Yes.
  
  
Q: Does installing/updating/uninstalling on an existing save work?
  
A: As far as I know, it should. However, it's good practice to keep a backup save prior to doing this, just in case.
  
  
Q: Is this compatible with <insert mod>?
  
A: I don't know by heart. You might need to check yourself.
  
  
Q: Will you make a patch for <insert mod>?
  
A: Only if it's a mod I use myself or plan on using it, I have enough time and I actually like the idea. Otherwise, feel free to do it yourself. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: Okay, I'll make you a patch. Can you upload it on this page?
  
A: First off, thank you very much for your effort! It is greatly appreciated. However, I prefer not to host it on my own page, as it would give users the impression I'm making patches myself and offering support and updates for those patches, which I am not willing to do. I would much rather prefer for you to make your own page and host them there.
  
  
Q: I have a suggestion to improve the mod. Can you do it?
  
A: Maybe, if I have time and I like the idea, I'll consider it.
  
  
Q: Will you port this to <insert platform>?
  
A: No, I myself only support the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If someone else wants to port it, feel free. (see permission) If you decide to port it, you yourself take full responsibility to offer support to said port. I will not provide no support for any ports by third parties.
  
  
Q: I use a ported version of this mod on <insert platform> and I have a problem. Can you help?
  
A: I don't provide any support for third party ports on other platforms than the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If you have issues, you should adress the person that ported it.
  
  
Q: Does this work on Skyrim 1.6+, aka "Anniversary Edition"?
  
A: Yes, it should.
  
  
Q: Why don't your mods use MCMs and instead use this janky console command system to set globals?
  
A: I am not a fan of MCMs. You can set the globals by making a patch in xEdit. I have no plans of changing this. If you want to add an MCM, feel free. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: Why don't you use FOMODs?
  
A: That would require reuploading the entire mod, in question, even if I only make a small change. My internet is limited and reuploading the files each time will take a huge chunk of my monthly volume.
