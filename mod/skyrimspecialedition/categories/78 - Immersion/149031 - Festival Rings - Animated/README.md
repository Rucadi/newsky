Bethesda was thoughtful enough to animated the flags, so it's obviously windy
  

[\*]This mod restores some logic to solitude's festive decoration

guaranteed to boost your immersion by at least 3.1%!

**Limits**
  
It's not the most elaborate mod or anything. I made this when testing some stuff for physics tweaks.
  
But since it's there why not share it, I guess.
  
  
Some mods might use the ring in a way where it actually does make sense to be static. If you use such a mod I recommend you keep a separate, static version and change via BOS or a patch where needed.
  
  
You can tell Skyrim has been around for quite awhile now by the amount of awkward static meshes used.
  
When looking into physics enabled chandeliers those things just really caught my attention.
