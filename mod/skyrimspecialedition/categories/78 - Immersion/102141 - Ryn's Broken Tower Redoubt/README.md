Built into the side of a mountain, with another mountain opposite of it, Broken Tower Redoubt never felt like it was whole. It seemed like it was missing an entire second half to the location. So I gave it just that.
  
  
The location is memorable for its dungeon exiting to the worldspace, for you to re-enter into the boss room at the top of the fort. Now, this exterior extension of the dungeon is even further extended, reaching beyond its walls and across the road, into an elevated Forsworn Fortress, where you'll meet a very formidable force who defends the boss room.
