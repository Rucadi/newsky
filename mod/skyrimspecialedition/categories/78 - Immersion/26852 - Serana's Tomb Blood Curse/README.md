**Description**
  
  
This mod afflicts the player with a severe disease when they try to releasing Serana, when the player is not a vampire (or werewolf).
  
  
At a certain point during the [Awakening](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Awakening) quest in the dawnguard questline, you'll come across Serana's tomb in Dimhollow Crypt.
  
  
When you activate the button of her sarcophagus, causing your hand to be impaled. Yet, in Vanilla, this has no consequences. So I decided to add one: "the Corrupted Blood Curse".
  
  
The Corrupted Blood Curse is inspired by the Decaying status effect from Divinity: Original Sin 2 and has similar effects: You will no longer regen health and healing spells and items will cause damage instead.
  
  
For compatibility issues, when the player is a werewolf, they will also be immune to the Curse.
  
  
If you contract the Curse and become a vampire or werewolf later on, the Curse will be removed as well.
  
  
If you are neither a werewolf, nor a vampire while you press the button, Disease Resistance is taken into account. By doing the math, you'll have a smaller chance depending how high your resistance is. For instance, if you have 75% Disease Resistance, you'll only have a 25% to catch the disease.
  
  
It can be cured like any disease in Vanilla, though. (Potion of Cure Disease or praying at a shrine)

SpoilerIn the [Decrepit Ruins](https://divinityoriginalsin2.wiki.fextralife.com/Decrepit+Ruins), you'll meet a Magister that have been afflicted with a "blood curse" after trying to open a cursed lever, without any knowledge of what their dealing with.
  
  
I felt like the player (when being a non-vampire) is in a similar situation when pressing the button on Serana's Sarcophagus: meddling in affairs above their head.
  
  
**FAQ**
  
  
Q: ESPFE?
  
A: Yes.
  
  
Q: Does installing/updating/uninstalling on an existing save work?
  
A: As far as I know, it should. However, it's good practice to keep a backup save prior to doing this, just in case.
  
  
Q: Is this compatible with <insert mod>?
  
A: I don't know by heart. You might need to check yourself.
  
  
Q: Will you make a patch for <insert mod>?
  
A: Only if it's a mod I use myself or plan on using, I have enough time and I actually like the idea. Otherwise, feel free to do it yourself. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: I have a suggestion to improve the mod. Can you do it?
  
A: Maybe, if I have time and I like the idea, I'll consider it.
  
  
Q: Will you port this to <insert platform>?
  
A: No, I myself only support the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If someone else wants to port it, feel free. (see permission) If you decide to port it, you yourself take full responsibility to offer support to said port. I will not provide no support for any ports by third parties.
  
  
Q: I use a ported version of this mod on <insert platform> and I have a problem. Can you help?
  
A: I don't provide any support for third party ports on other platforms than the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If you have issues, you should adress the person that ported it.
  
  
Q: Does this work on Skyrim 1.6+, aka "Anniversary Edition"?
  
A: Yes, it should.
  
  
Q: Why don't your mods use MCMs and instead use this janky console command system to set globals?
  
A: I am not a fan of MCMs. You can set the globals by making a patch in xEdit. I have no plans of changing this. If you want to add an MCM, feel free. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: Why don't you use FOMODs?
  
A: That would require reuploading the entire mod, in question, even if I only make a small change. My internet is limited and reuploading the files each time will take a huge chunk of my monthly volume.
