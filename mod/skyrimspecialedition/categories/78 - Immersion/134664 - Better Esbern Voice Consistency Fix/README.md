Details****Ever noticed Esbern's Inconsistent Voice? This Mod Brings a Polished Solution.**
  
If you’ve noticed Esbern’s voice fluctuating between two distinct tones, you’re not alone. Some of his lines were performed by an uncredited second actor, creating a jarring inconsistency that breaks immersion. This mod replaces all 116 of those inconsistent lines with Ai-generated lines of the original voice actor - Max von Sydow. With a focus on emotional fidelity, audio consistency, and natural pacing, this mod ensures Esbern’s voice feels cohesive and immersive throughout your adventure.
