**About:**
  
Inspired by the "Hand of the King" pin from Game of Thrones & House of the Dragon, I thought it was only fitting to give Skyrim's Stewards something to make them a little more official. 
  
  
**What this mod includes:**
  
• Wearable Badges of Office for Skyrim's Stewards (Biped Slot 60)
  
• Automatically changes based on the outcome of the Civil War
  
• Automatically detects Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch fixes (Not required)
  
• Complex Parallax (Requires ENB)
  
• No Record Edits

**How to Obtain:**
  
  
• You don't. They're for Stewards only!

**FAQ:**
  
  
1) I spawned a badge but can't wear it!
  
• This is intentional, they're for Stewards only. I may make an Amulet version in the future as an alternative.
  
  
2) It doesn't work / models are missing / textures are purple
  
• Make sure you have the requirements and make sure it's actually enabled in your mod manager.
  
  
3) I get a conflict error with js\_shinydwe\_e.dds
  
• You can overwrite or ignore. It's the same file included in some of my other mods.
  
  
4) LE please?
  
• No plans
  
  
5) What's the next release?
  
• I'm torn, this small mod was for getting back into things, so who knows. Check my Patreon for WIP's
