**[size=4]FEATURES[/size]**
  
  
Adds doorbells to various merchant stores around Skyrim. Added only to locations where it made most sense, such as stores in larger towns or trade houses with an Imperial merchant. Nord smiths would not have a doorbell at their store for example.
  
  

﻿

  
**Interactability**
  

  
* The bell plays a chime sound and an animation every time you enter a store through the main door. Sneaking while entering does not ring the bell (alternatively chosen in the **FOMOD** to require the *Light Foot* perk instead)

  
* Can be activated or hit as well

  
* If the bell is rung while trespassing, the owner gets alerted and calls the guards

  
**List of affected locations**
  

  
* **Solitude**, Angeline's Aromatics
**Solitude**, Radiant Raiment
  
* **Solitude**, Bits and Pieces
**Markarth**, The Hag's Cure
  
* **Markarth**, Arnleif and Sons Trading Company
**Riften**, Pawned Prawn
  
* **Riverwood**, Riverwood Trader
**Whiterun**, Arcadia's Cauldron
  
* **Whiterun**, Belethor's General Goods

  
  
**COMPATIBILITY**
  
  
This mod *should* be compatible with most interior overhauls. Some town overhauls change the whole architecture and remake the interiors accordingly – in such cases the mod would most likely need a patch. I can create patches for specific mods if requested.
