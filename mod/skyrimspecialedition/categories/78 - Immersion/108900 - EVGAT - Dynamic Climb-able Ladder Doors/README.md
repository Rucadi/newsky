# EVGAT - Dynamic Climb-able Ladder Doors
- Author: SeaSparrow
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/108900


Until EVG - Animated Traversal came along, ladders in Skyrim were purely cosmetic. Using that framework and Base Object Swapper by PO3, this mod aims to increase immersion to heights unknown by dynamically turning boring pseudo-doors into animated ladders!

  Unsure how to install? No worries, GamerPoets has you covered in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdiFIL_02dI)﻿!All the following mods can be installed with your mod manager. Load order and install order doesn't matter. Unsure what version to have? If you haven't downgraded (or don't know what downgrading is), you're more than likely on the latest version of Skyrim, so you want mods for 1.6.1130+.

This mod can be installed at any point, even during a save. Load order does not matter. As of the latest version of EVG - Animated Traversal, Nemesis is no longer a requirement. Have fun!
