**Hey That's Mine!**
  
  
I always hated that I could just take what I pleased at any point in the towns and areas.
  
So I created a collection of ESL plugins that adds ownership in a few various areas, added by a few various mods.
  
Ownership additions get added as I continue through my playthrough.
  
A detailed list of all the items found and added can be [found on the google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qXdJ1jheRmc4-22eH9UdXTWJGk7JbSXLz69mCgVvgCY/edit?usp=sharing)
  
This list also includes the ownership that was given , which might provide you some insight in how it may become available to take at some point.
  
  
My playthrough is with the Constellation's mod collection and will likely not contain duplicates from that mod collection.
  
  
The main vortex file will be a Fomod installer. Choose what you want :)
  
  
  
**Want to make a suggestion on what should have ownership?**I am working on integrating a discord command to add an entry to a database for review
