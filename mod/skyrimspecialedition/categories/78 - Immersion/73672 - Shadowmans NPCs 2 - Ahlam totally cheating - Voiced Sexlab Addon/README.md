Version 2:
  
Replaced audio with new generated voices.
  
My gratitude to "mortified anonymous helper" who generated Nazeem's lines. **Audio no longer available on Nexus. I lost it in a boating accident.**
  
  
About this small mod:
  
-Identifying the vulnerable prey, the unsatisfied married woman, the dragonborn can approach Ahlam to innocently and altruistically distract her from her problems. Talk to her anytime she is not at home.
  
-Visit Ahlam after 20.00 at Wintersand Manor (Requires cutting room floor) to seduce her.
  
-Ahlam will tell you how inadequate Nazeem is with random responses.
  
-You can tell Nazeem how hot his wife is (after seducing her), and he will tell you that you are inadequate to ever have a woman like her with random responses.
  
-About 80 lines of dialogue.
  
  
This is not a quest mod. Its not about jumping through hoops to achieve a goal. The whole series is about the mighty dragonborn and female NPCs being weak for his alpha cock (lol).
  
  
In my game, Ahlam goes to the Wintersand Manor from cutting room floor after 20.00 and stays there until 8 in the morning.
  
In the vanilla game she is supposed to sleep in the first Whiterun inn. I havent found an AI package in cutting room floor that changes that. Im also using AI Citizens overhaul, though cutting room floor is not a requirement for this one.
  
I have no idea how and where, if anyone knows please comment.
