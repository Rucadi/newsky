Version 2
  
New immaculate voice.
  
===================================
  
  
6 months are completed today since i started playing Skyrim and joined this site, im also celebrating my 50th mod.
  
  
Mod Features:
  
-About 100 lines of dialogue added.
  
-You can tempt Sigrid when her husband is not around. You need to have killed the first dragon in whiterun. The dialogue is written for a male character.
  
-You can ask her to cook for you when she is at home.
  
-You can gift her money to buy something (once a day).
  
-You can ask her to give you milk (lol).
  
-You can ask her to be barefoot. Just kidding, why the hell would you ask her that? Why would anyone make such [mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72744)? Thats [wrong](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkyrimMemes/comments/wh4ikz/i_despise_you_all/).
  
  
Suggested use:
  
This little mod is not designed to be consumed in one sitting. You are meant to go do your quests or whatever and once in a while visit Sigrid for a little interaction and hearing a lot of new material for a long time. Of course, do whatever the hell you want, it's your game.
  
This is not a quest mod.
  
  
The file is light.
  
  
Im thinking about making a series of mods like this one, for about 10 npcs, each with a different personality and theme.
  
Please leave some feedback if you like it.
