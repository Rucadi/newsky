An ongoing project with the goal of bringing Skyrim's Worldspace to a more updated level of detail with new locations, improved locations, and more interesting encounters, all while generally sticking to Bethesda's style of level design, and with performance and mod compatibility for the average player in mind.

 Ryn's Mehrunes Dagon's Shrine
  
  
[/font][font=Georgia]Originally a small, uninteresting, weirdly lit room. I was always shocked to walk into the Shrine and see such a strange room.
  
Keeping to the original idea of a loot-rich room, the dungeon *(Big enough to qualify as a dungeon now)* now has **MORE** loot, but it is more spread out, and protected by more Dagon-worshiping enemies.

[/font][font=Georgia]A Special Thank you﻿
  
A very special friend of mine who encouraged me to start modding.
  
Those who have helped encourage me, helped with feedback, and supported my work, thank you.
  
Without you, I do not think this project would continue.
  
As always, I love you, and happy modding.
