Footprints - heels addon

  
  
  
Overview
  
[color=rgb(97, 97, 97)][color=#f4f4f4]Ever wanted to embark on journey with that fancy armor from BDO series or any other skimpy stylish outfit which comes with heels and to enter bandits outpost and defeat them just by standing. But yeah, there is no corresponding footprints for your footwear? And that can break the immersion. NO MORE!
  
There are people (grumpy ones) which says that is utmost unimmersive to climb on the top of the snowy mountain with heels but how about bend a time or other people to your will or petting the dragon?! Compared to those things a fighting with group of bandits on the floating ice chunk with big bastard in your hands and wearing those stylish pumps, is just a piece of cake (at least i think so).

Implementation


  
* Builded on already existed scripts from Footprints, zero edits to scripts whatsoever
Custom magic effects to attache corresponding heels footprints with users
  
* Edited 2 spells with proper conditions to distribute them into player and npcs (no need fresh start or cleaning your save)
Heels footprints will appear on the surface of landscape or objects (nifs) which are considered as a snow, ash, sand or mud.
  
* Easy integration with outfit mods. Just by adding my plugin as a master and a single keyword "checkHeels" to your armor boots or use [KiD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55728)﻿
