*I do not inspect or have any influence over translations of my mods (including those linked directly on my pages), nor do I have any power over patches or add-ons made to my content. So, before using any unofficial add-ons for my mods, make sure they conform to the latest version of my official release, and never use these if they don't. The same applies to Xbox ports;*

![](https://i.imgur.com/PwJxVUw.png)*You can now hear blowflies flying around rotting corpses, whether human or animal. Without a doubt, your world will have an extra touch of realism, immersion and it will also become a little more disgusting.*Flies can be heard flying around still fresh bones with flesh clinging to them, places where murders have taken place and everything is covered in blood, caves of predatory animals filled with their victims, posts with enemies' heads stuck on, around the gruesome totems of the Hagravens, inside places of necromancy, around freshly cut meat or hanging fish, and much more.
  
  
Naturally, the sounds appear randomly in the world around the mentioned type of scenarios, so not all of these places will necessarily have blowflies around, even for the sake of realism, and they are much more common in the central and southern regions of Skyrim, being less present in snowy regions, due to the intense cold.[/font][/left][left][/left][left][font=Times New Roman]*﻿

(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

[/font][font=Times New Roman]The Shards of Immersion saga brings small elements that add a touch of immersion and realism to the fantastic world of Skyrim, making it even more alive and dynamic, which seems to exist beyond the adventure of the Dragonborn.
