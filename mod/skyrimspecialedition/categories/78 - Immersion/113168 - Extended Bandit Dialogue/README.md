# Extended Bandit Dialogue
- Author: Jonx0r

Features
  

  
* **Recognition of Notable Opponents**: Bandits may now recognize you as the leader of the Companions, Thieves Guild, Dark Brotherhood, College of Winterhold, or as a high-ranking war veteran during combat.
**More Dialogue Variety**: Overhear bandits grumble about their lives, personal struggles, the dungeon they currently reside in, and much more. They'll also bemoan the current world state, such as the return of the dragons, the current weather, the state of the Thieves Guild, and so on.
  
* **Seamless Integration**: Extended Bandit Dialogue currently adds over 110 new lines of dialogue for all 11 voice types used by bandits: FemaleCommoner, FemaleEvenToned, FemaleNord, FemaleOrc, MaleArgonian, MaleBandit, MaleCommoner, MaleEvenToned, MaleKhajiit, MaleNord, and MaleOrc. The new lines of dialogue included in this mod have been generated using Tortoise TTS and RVC and should be almost indistinguishable from the original voice acting.
**Lightweight and Compatible**: The only thing this mod adds are new lines of dialogue for bandits. It makes zero edits, making it compatible with other mods that also give bandits new lines of dialogue, such as Bandit Lines Expansion.

Manual Installation

Unzip the contents of the zip file to your Skyrim Special Edition Data folder: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition\Data.
  
 
  
2. Confirm you have the following files in your Skyrim Special Edition Data folder:
     
     
   Extended Bandit Dialogue.esp
     
   Extended Bandit Dialogue.bsa
Open %userprofile%\AppData\Local\Skyrim Special Edition\plugins.txt and add **\*Extended Bandit Dialogue.esp** after your master files.

F.A.Q.
  
Q. What patch level is required?
  
A. None.
  
  
Q. Do I need Dawnguard, Hearthfire or Dragonborn or additional plugins like SKSE?
  
A. No.
  
  
Q. Is this ESL flagged?
  
A. Yes.
  
  
Q. What version of the Creation Kit was this made with?
  
A. 1.6.438.0. It's compatible with both Special Edition and Anniversary Edition.
  
  
Q. Is this safe to add/remove mid-game?
  
A. Yes.
  
  
Q. Why am I not hearing any new lines of dialogue?
  
A. Firstly, ensure you've loaded the mod and check the [Extended Bandit Dialogue.csv](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12cNLb96MUPl6q9SljkGDQr1oUqIcPZg5ocakKRilJIw/edit?usp=sharing) file for a list of new lines and their associated conditions. Only NPCs that are in the BanditFaction faction will use the new lines added by this mod. If you have a mod installed that removes bandits from that faction, it'll prevent this mod from working properly.
  
  
Q. I don't want to hear a specific line of dialogue. How do I disable it?
  
A. You can use the following console command to disable a specific line, if you don't want to hear it:
  
  

```
set EBDChance_### to 0
```

  
  
See the [Extended Bandit Dialogue.csv](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12cNLb96MUPl6q9SljkGDQr1oUqIcPZg5ocakKRilJIw/edit?usp=sharing) for a list of dialogue IDs.
  
  
  
Important
  
See the [Extended Bandit Dialogue Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12cNLb96MUPl6q9SljkGDQr1oUqIcPZg5ocakKRilJIw/edit?usp=sharing) for a list of all new lines of dialogue plus their associated conditions. There are currently 112 new lines of dialogue (50 new Idle lines, 31 new Notice Corpse lines, and 31 new Combat Taunt lines) for each of the 11 voice types used by bandits in the base game.
  
  
This mod doesn't include any script files so there shouldn't be any issues adding or removing it mid-playthrough. New dialogue is set up in its own quest so it should work well alongside other mods that also affect bandit dialogue.
