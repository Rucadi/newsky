Ryn's Halted Stream Camp
  
  
One of the most visited locations in the game, Halted Stream Camp is notable, but boring. The location introduces a story of mammoth-poaching bandits who... also constructed a mine? It just doesn't make enough sense to me.
  
Now, along with [Whiterun: City Limits](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65661), Halted Stream Camp is the remains of Halted Stream Mine, next to a small mining hamlet, destroyed in Whiterun's dramatic history of war and conflict. Abandoned by locals, now taken over by bandits, Halted Stream Mine offered a fantastic opportunity for the group to live of fruitful life full of mammoth meat, mammoth tusk trade, and turning their iron ore into *gold*.
  
All while surrounded by a naturally fortified wall of terrain, and structures built before they were even there.﻿
