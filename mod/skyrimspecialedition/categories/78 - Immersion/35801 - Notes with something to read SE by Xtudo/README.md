Notes with something to read SE
  
by Xtudo**

**Description**
  
This mod will add something to read to the notes used in the animation performed by your character or a NPC.
  

  
* There are 4 versions to choose.
It won't affect common static notes, or anything else.
  
* 1k optimized textures.
Good to use with mods like Dovahkiin Relaxes Too.
  

  
**I did it for my game and now I'm sharing it, I hope you like it.**
