**XBOX version also available on Bethesda.net!**
  
  
Farming is a straightforward addon when it comes to gameplay. However, it also comes with a short quest featuring an NPC line that feels out of place in context. I also felt the farm workers could use a bit personality to better reflect the mundane life of a farmer. With Voiced Narrative, your farming life in Skyrim is now a bit more immersive and colorful.
  
**Feature:**
  
- New random greeting lines for your overseer and farmhands of Goldenhills Plantation.
  
- Bad use of a generic line (Rin) is replaced with a new line that better reflect the narrative.
  
- All new lines were written with careful consideration of existing lore, nothing should feel too overdone.
  
- Voiced lines were generated with ElevenLabs. Many hours were spent experimenting lines repeatedly to hand-pick the most natural-sounding deliveries with the right expression for each context.
  
- Fully compatible with [CC Farming - Tweaks Enhancements and Quest Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69029?).

**FAQ:**
  
**Is this ESL-flagged (ESPFE)?**
  
Yes.
  
  
**Is this compatible with Unofficial Skyrim Creation Club Content Patches?**
  
Yes.
  
**[b]I noticed some grammar errors and thought a few lines could be improved?**
  
[/b]I'm always open to any feedback on improving dialogue and grammar**,**but please provide helpful feedback over one-liner criticism.
  
**Is this compatible with my face overhaul mod that change the same NPCs from this mod?**
  
Yes, it only changes dialogue records, NPCs are left intact.
  
  
**Will this break my save?**
  
This mod mainly edited dialogue records that already existed. It's safe to install mid game; removing it will just revert everything back to vanilla lines.
