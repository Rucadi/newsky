Hello everyone!
  
  
Have you ever felt that you were robbed hearing that the Bosmer practiced ritual cannibalism, but were unable to do so in game? Do you want to sink your teeth into some juicy man flesh? Well now you can! How you ask? It's quite simple really! While playing a Bosmer (Wood Elf) you will have a hidden perk that will allow you to harvest meat from the enemies you kill! This new meat can be used to make a two new food items! One is a simple cooked meat, the other is a nice tasty pie!
  
  
Enemies that begin the game dead, and those not slain by the player will not have the new meat! Who knows how long that body has been laying there, or if the person/thing that killed it did so cleanly?
  
  
This should be compatible with everything out there!
  
  
Version 2 is now out! This will require a new game, due to the changes made! Thank you everyone and have fun!
