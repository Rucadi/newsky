**OCum Ascended**

  
  
**READ the description carefully!** Below is, in detail, every piece of information regarding what this mod does, how it works, and how to make it work in your game. Failure to read the description will mean you'll most likely run into problems. **I will not provide support if you don't read the description.**
  
  
OCum Ascended is an overhaul and rebuild of OCum, an OStim addon made by [Sairion350](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/98523348). OCum adds cum effects to OStim scenes, as well as female squirting, physical cum projectiles, cum sounds and effects, and many other features related to orgasms.
  
  
The Ascended version is a rewritten version of OCum which fixes the most common bugs present in OCum, adds new features (such as new and better cum textures, boobjob support, threesome support, more MCM options, more customization, among others), makes the plugin an ESP flagged ESL so it won't take a slot in your load order, aims for more realism, and so much more! For the full list of new features and bugs fixed, as well as the installation guide, keep on reading.

**List of new features and bugs fixed from the original OCum**

  
  
- Most of the code was completely rewritten. Many performance and optimisation improvements were made.
  
  
- Mods that require the original version of OCum will work with OCum Ascended - an exception to this, however, is OCum Spells, but it won't crash your game or anything if you use it with OCum Ascended. The spells simply won't apply cum.
  
  
- The ESP file has the same name as the old OCum and is ESP flagged ESL so it doesn't take a slot on your load order.
  
  
- OCum Ascended now has its own separate MCM menu with new and more options. **Do NOT use the OCum MCM options in the OStim MCM Addons tab. They won't work!** It's highly recommended to also use [OCum Ascended - Cum and Orgasm Mechanics for OStim - Settings Loader](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77659), courtesy of [MaskedRPGFan](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/22822094)!
  
  
- Cum application is much more realistic.
  
  
- New and better textures:
  
 OCum Ascended includes 50 different cum textures, which will be used and combined randomly. Check the images section! In comparison, the original OCum only had 14 textures!
  
 Cum textures are courtesy of [Buggz](https://www.loverslab.com/profile/3280520-buggzz/) from [SlaveTats Cum Textures/Replacer 1.5](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/14696-slavetats-cum-texturesreplacer/), and [ZMD78](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/58135806) from [ZMD's HD Cum Overlays for RaceMenu SE v2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33555) who kindly gave me permission to use them. Please make sure to endorse their mods!
  
 All textures were downsized to 2K and saved using BC7 compression, which makes them extremely lighweight while still retaining a very high visual quality!
  
  
- New cum patterns - cum can now also be applied to face, hands, feet, legs, thighs, back, butt, boobs and belly, all depending on the current animation type!
  
  
- Facials are now much better and work properly, with more variations.

- Provides MCM option to disable facials for Tera Elin race. Note that Tera Elin race is NOT a requirement. The setting only takes effect if Tera Elin is installed. If it's not installed, it does nothing and you don't have to worry about it.
  
    Reasoning: Tera Elin race has different face maps from other races, which means the facial textures apply to the wrong spots on the face. Tera Elin body works just fine though. If you are willing to fix the facial textures to be compatible with Tera Elin face maps, contact me.
  
  
- Full support for masturbation, boobjob, footjob, handjob, blowjob and pull-out animations from the different OStim Standalone animation packs.
  
  
- Full 3p+ support, which means that cum will be applied to all valid characters! For example, during a double boob job in a threesome, both partners doing the boob job will get cum applied to their chest area.
  
  
- Cum application cleaning time is now handled by a magic effect (this does not have any effect on the stats of your character). Before you think this is bad, go to question **14)** of the **Frequently Asked Questions** section. I explain there how the magic effect works and how it has zero performance impact on your game. The old OCum used another method that was unpredictable, inconsistent and overall did not work well.
  
  
- Cum cleaning timers are now separate and completely configurable in the MCM (this basically adjusts the magic effect timer mentioned above). The default is 5 real life minutes (or 1 ingame hour). You can set them anywhere between 30 seconds and 1 hour.
  
  
- Cum can now be cleaned when a character with cum enters water (must be swimming). This is on by the default in the MCM menu.
  
  
- Squirt chance is now fully configurable in the MCM (it was hardcoded at 25% in the original OCum).
  
  
- There are now 3 different squirt effects which will play randomly. They also no longer reset facial expressions, unlike the old OCum versions!
  
  
- There are now 4 high quality squirt sounds which will play randomly.
  
  
- New options in MCM good for emergencies or screen archers - you can clear cum from all actors in one click in the MCM at any time!
  
  
- Cum storage max amount is now deleveled and fully configurable in the MCM menu.
  
  
- OSA dependency was removed.
  
  
- Fixes bug with the cum bar stopping working after a few hours of play time.
  
  
- Fixes bug where camera would start switching between free cam and normal cam continuously during squirt.
  
  
- Fixes bug where cum would be applied before orgasm when using OVirginity.
  
  
- Fixes bug where cum from facials would be applied to the entire body instead of just the face during blowjobs and similar animations.
  
  
- Fixes bug where cum would not be applied at all.
  
  
- Fixes bug where cum regeneration modifier would be set to 0.0, which means that cum wouldn't regenerate nor be applied.
  
  
- Fixes bug where, after OStim scenes ended and actors redressed, cum would go from the body to the clothes. Cum now stays beneath the clothes, on the skin only, as it should.
  
  
- Cum projectiles no longer clip through actors as they are disabled automatically in animations where you wouldn't see the projectiles (for example vaginal intercourse, blowjobs, etc).[/size]

Cum is realistically applied depending on the position of the penis relative to the partner's body!

  
  
  
  

**Installation Guide**

  
  
OCum Ascended needs OStim Standalone 7.1d or higher. IT WILL NOT WORK IN OLDER VERSIONS.
  
  
**If you are upgrading from an older version of OCum, [PLEASE READ THIS GUIDE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/5541).**
  
  
  
  

**How OCum works (copied and adjusted from the old OCum description)**

  
  
For males:
  
- All males generate cum in their bodies over time. The amount of cum stored is dependent on what you set on the MCM.
  
- In an OStim scene, when a male orgasms, their stored cum is released onto their partner.
  
- Males shoot cum projectiles with collision on orgasm.
  
- A new, advanced decal system is used for applying cum to bodies with multi-layer support.
  
  
For females:
  
- When a female orgasms, she has a chance to spray squirting effects (configurable in the OCum Ascended MCM) .
  
  
**Pressing Right-Ctrl will pull up an onscreen bar to show you how much cum is inside your character for males.** This key can be changed in the OCum Ascended MCM.
  
  
Male cum storage
  
The amount of cum a male stores and ejaculates is dependent on what you set in the MCM. Cum fully regenerates in around one in-game day, but regeneration speed is also fully configurable in the MCM.
  
  
Cum projectiles
  
 Cum projectiles blast out and will splash and leave a decal where they land (they do not collied with character bodies however). The amount of projectiles fired from the penis is dependent on how big the load size is. Effects are courtesy Erstam's Cumshot, however they have been heavily tweaked for more volume and different angles.
  
  
Cum decals
  
Depending on load size, various textures will be applied to the character cummed onto. This system is advanced and supports multi-layering, so continually cumming will make the layers stack up. Additionally load size will determine the texture chosen. OCum has MORE cum texture variants than Sexlab, and each variant can stack to make new patterns. OCum Ascended adds even more texture variants: 50 textures against the old OCum's 14 textures!
  
  
Cum decals are cleared after a set time (configurable in the OCum Ascended MCM), and can also be cleared if the character enters water (must be turned on in the MCM, and the character must be swimming for the cleaning on water to trigger).
  
  
Cum textures are courtesy of [Buggz](https://www.loverslab.com/profile/3280520-buggzz/) from [SlaveTats Cum Textures/Replacer 1.5](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/14696-slavetats-cum-texturesreplacer/), and [ZMD78](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/58135806)﻿ from [ZMD's HD Cum Overlays for RaceMenu SE v2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33555)﻿ who kindly gave me permission to use them. Please make sure to endorse their mods!
  
  
All textures were downsized to 2K and saved using BC7 compression, which makes them extremely lighweight while still retaining a very high visual quality!
  
  
Squirting
  
Females have a 25% chance to squirt when they orgasm by default. Can be changed in the OCum Ascended MCM. Visuals courtesy Erstam and Ed86.
  
  
Load size and visuals
  
The size of an ejaculation influences the cum visuals you see. If a male has been orgasming frequently and is shooting blanks, you will see little to no effects.
  
  
All NPCs including the player are tracked
  
All of OCum's effects and stats apply to everyone.
  
  
Ultra-performance friendly
  
Despite tracking semen stats for every single male NPC across Skyrim, OCum is extremely performance friendly and uses a number of tricks so that it rarely has to run scripts. Script processing is done only during orgasm. No script cloaks or anything like it are used.
  
  
A lightweight magic effect is used to track cum cleaning time, which can be removed at any time in the OCum Ascended MCM.
  
  
Note that this magic effect does **NOT** poll NPCs and does not have any scripts attached to it. All it does is a call to the function to clear the cum overlays when the effect ends. There is **NOT** any script running in the background when NPCs are affected with this magic effect. Besides that, the magic effect is only applied to the NPCs you cum onto. All other NPCs will not have it active.

Cum stays on for as long as you set it on the MCM even after OStim scenes end!

  
  
  
  

**Frequently Asked Questions**

  
  
1) Nothing works!!
  
  
For OCum Ascended to work, OStim Standalone and all the requirements must be working properly in the first place. Follow the [OStim Standalone installation guide carefully](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/5654).
  
  
  
2) The MCM options aren't working!
  
  
As I've already said like 3 times on the description, OCum Ascended now has its own MCM and the options in the OStim Addons MCM tab will not work. Use the OCum Ascended MCM.
  
  
  
3) Cum decals/textures are not appearing, why?
  
  
Some animation packs may be improperly tagged, or not support animations like boob jobs and foot jobs. In this case, OCum Ascended can't detect the type of animation properly and fail to apply cum.
  
  
Also take into account that OCum Ascended applies cum through Racemenu overlays. So, if your characters have a lot of overlays already, there may not be free slots for cum to be applied, which means OCum Ascended doesn't have any slot to apply cum. Free up some overlays from your character. OCum Ascended uses all 4 areas to apply cum - face, body, hands and feet.
  
  
Cum amount is also limited. If the male has cummed too many times in a given day, he will no longer be able to cum on orgasm. In this case, no cum textures are applied. Give him a rest!
  
  
If you are using Skyrim GOG version, and therefore Racemenu GOG version, overlay application was not working in earlier versions of Racemenu GOG. You need Racemenu GOG version 0.4.19.14 or greater for cum application to work.
  
  
If you are on Racemenu GOG 0.4.19.13, update your Racemenu GOG and overlay application will work again.
  
  
  
4) Are futa characters supported?
  
  
I personally don't use nor like futa, so I never tested it myself. However, it worked in the old OCum and I didn't change the code related to that. Quoting Sairion from the old OCum description:
  
  
> Yes, all characters with a Schlongs of Skyrim schlong attached will be treated as male automatically. This can even be switched mid-game and the system will treat them as a different gender automatically.
>   
>   
> If you don't have SoS installed, normal Skyrim gender settings are used.

  
  
If you still have problems with futa somehow, don't expect me to support it. Since I don't use it and know nothing about futa modding in Skyrim, I am not willing to fix or update anything related to it. However, if you know how to fix any problems with futa or have some improvements in mind, you are free to make PRs [to the repository](https://github.com/Aietos/OCum-Ascended). I'll merge them and include your changes in future OCum Ascended releases.
  
  
  
5) Why do some cum decals look black or transparent?
  
  
If your skin texture is really light (such as Fair Skin Complexion, The Pure, Diamond Skin, among others), the cum can blend in perfectly and look slightly black or transparent. This can also be heavily affected by ENB shaders and effects. Nothing I can do about that.
  
  
  
6) Can the textures and sounds in this mod be swapped out?
  
  
Yes, simply replacing the .wav and .dds files in this mod will replace them in game. You are free to release texture and sound packs.
  
  
Note that for the cum overlays, you must respect the name of the current files. If you remove or add more textures, the OCum scripts must also be updated, otherwise either your new textures won't be applied or you will get purple bodies due to missing overlays as a result of wrong naming.
  
  
  
7) Scene ends abruptly when I play as a female and get hit by cum projectiles!
  
  
Disable End If Attacked in OStim MCM menu.
  
  
  
8) My MCM options aren't being respected, what's happening?
  
  
Read the tooltips of the MCM options carefully when you hover them with your cursor. Most of them will only apply to characters you cum on after changing the options. For instance, if you cum on a character with cum set to clean after 5 minutes, and then change the cum cleaning timer to 20 minutes, the 20 minutes will only apply after you cum on that character again.
  
  
  
10) Can you add this or that feature?
  
  
Suggestions are welcome. Doesn't mean I'll do them, but I'll gladly listen to suggestions. If you know how to implement them and want to take some work off my back, then do it yourself and submit a PR to the [OCum Ascended Github repository](https://github.com/Aietos/OCum-Ascended).
  
  
  
11) Magic effect to handle cum application timer? That sounds bad!
  
  
Except it's not. The magic effect isn't a cloak that is polling the NPCs all the time. The magic effect in fact does absolutely **nothing**. It runs zero scripts while it's active. It eats no resources. It has zero performance impact on your game. When the effect ends, the cum textures are removed, and this function is equally lightweight. The on effect end event is handled by Skyrim's engine itself.
  
  
Think about it, when you poison or debuff 10 NPCs while in combat, does it negatively affect your game's performance? Does doing that ruin your save? It doesn't. So OCum's magic effect won't either - because it behaves exactly the same as those effects already built in to the game.
  
  
No NPC has the effect until you cum on them. And the effect goes away after the time you set on the MCM. In normal gameplay scenarios, you won't have more than 3 NPCs with cum on them. As you can see, this is nothing like the creepy spell cloaks full of background scripts running all the time that you would see in many Skyrim mods years ago. Rest assured I would never do something like that in a mod of mine.
  
  
I build all my mods with performance and good modding practices in mind. I use the mods that I make, so I definitely don't want to ruin my own saves or make my game perform bad, let alone a stranger's.
  
  
  
12) When I cum on characters, their bodies become purple or blue. What's wrong?
  
  
This is a very rare bug so far only reported by 1 user. If this happens, it's because the texture files got corrupted while downloading them from Nexus or while your mod manager (Vortex, MO2, etc) was unzipping them.
  
  
Try redownloading and then reinstalling the mod. If that doesn't fix it, make sure you have 7-zip installed on your computer. Try again after installing 7-zip.
  
  
If that still doesn't fix it, download OCum Ascended from the [Github repository](https://github.com/Aietos/OCum-Ascended), unzip the folder, and then **copy ONLY the textures folder** to the folder where Vortex/MO2 installed OCum Ascended and let it overwrite. That will most likely fix the issue.
  
  
  
13) Should I use OCum Ascended or OCum Inflated? What's the difference?
  
  
You should use OCum Ascended along with [OInflation](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/103761) if you want the inflation features. OInflation is a new mod from the same author of OCum Inflated, but OInflation is now an OCum Ascended addon, meant to be used alongside OCum Ascended.
  
  
OCum Inflated is now a deprecated addon. OCum Ascended + OInflation is the modern recommended combo, provided you want the features that OInflation adds to OCum Ascended.
  
  
  
14) I went through all this and still nothing works!
  
  
Providing help on the Nexus is difficult and not very efficient. For faster responses and a better troubleshooting workflow, I suggest you join the [OStim Discord](http://discord.gg/ostim). I hang there often and will help you. If I'm not available, there are many others on the channel who use OCum and can help you with installation and troubleshooting problems.
  
  
  
  

**I want to contribute to OCum Ascended's code**

  
  
Please, be my guest. Me and the community will be grateful if you help fix bugs or implement new features. Here are the Github links, feel free to fork them and make PRs if you change the code. I'll review, approve and merge them to release on the Nexus.

**Mods used in screenshots**

  
  
**The character in the screenshots taken by [EddieNX89](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/68987598) is a private preset made by Eddie himself which he is not willing to share. Please do not bother him asking for the preset. You can, however, follow his amazing work on this [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/HE7RNsDU7p)!**
  
  
The Redguard on the logo, the Breton and Bodyslides are presets made by [SilverWolfMNG](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/4126073) that you can find in the #character-preset-dev channel on the [OStim Discord](http://discord.gg/ostim). Please don't bother me asking for them either. They will soon be available on the Nexus as well. **Please do not bother Silver asking for unreleased presets. That won't make him release the presets any faster, and he will not send them privately to you either. Join the OStim Discord if you can't wait.**
