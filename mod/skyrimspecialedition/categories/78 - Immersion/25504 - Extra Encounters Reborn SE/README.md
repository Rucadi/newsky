[font=Courier New]Mod Description
  
Extra Encounters Reborn SE is a lore-friendly mod which adds leveled and randomized encounters to the world of Skyrim. 
  
  
The goal of this mod mod is not to drastically change the Skyrim experience, but rather to add more to it.
  
  
These new encounters are frequent enough to make exploring Skyrim intense and fun, not to make Skyrim overcrowded and unrealistic. The encounters were intentionally designed to have similar traits to Bethesda's encounters, without being off-putting.
  
  
Each encounter you come across is relevant to your current location. For example, the Forsworn will not be found outside The Reach, and Stormcloak Soldiers are unlikely to be encountered near Solitude.
  
[/font]
  
[font=Courier New]Encounters are created via Skyrim's predator spawns. These spawns are found throughout Skyrim, and usually create things like bears or wolves.[/font]

FEATURES
  
Some of the encounters you may come across include (but are not limited to): Bandits, Vigilants of Stendarr, Imperial soldiers, Stormcloak soldiers, Forsworn, peddlers, hunters, Thalmor justicars, mercenaries, adventurers, warlocks, vampires, and more!

﻿COMPATIBILITY
  
The following section will display what changes have been made to the base game. This will help you identify any possible mod conflicts.
  
  
[/font][font=Courier New]If there is a conflict, determine which mod is more important to you, then place the chosen mod farther down in the load order. This will result in the chosen mod taking priority over the other mod. [/font][font=Courier New][font=Courier New][size=4]You could also try and make them compatible.

[font=Courier New]KNOWN ISSUES
  
Peddlers, mercenaries, and adventurers may not react to interactions if you are caught pickpocketing them. This is caused by an unknown reason. It is speculated that this is ingrained into the game.

F.A.Q.[/font][font=Courier New]
  
Q - Why is Extra Encounters incompatible with (insert other mod name here)?
  
A - If the mod information is not mentioned under the compatibility section of this description, the problem lies elsewhere. You will need to test a combination of mods, and if successful, please let me know of the results in the comments, so that I can clarify it to everyone else.
  
  
Q - Will this mod cause save bloats?
  
A - Each encounter will delete itself after you reach a certain distance from it or leave the cell. Dead bodies from an encounter will eventually vanish, as each encounter is set to respawn. Not only that, but each NPC & creature involved in an encounter is set so that they cannot disintegrated by lightning spells--no more ash piles lying around until the end of time.
  
  
Q - How can I tell if the mod is working?
  
A - Enable the mod and load any saved game. Open the console and type in "COC\_ExtraEncounters". You will find yourself in a test dungeon, where there are several buttons. Pressing a button will spawn either an animal, or an encounter. Keep in mind that sometimes pressing the button will not spawn anything at all (due to some encounters having set conditions). If you are unable to spawn a single encounter from the ten available buttons, you're either extremely unlucky, or the mod is not working properly, possibly due to a mod conflict.
  
  
Q - I've looked around and I can't find any encounters. Where are they?
  
A - First, do not go looking for the encounters, since you are going to find yourself very bored if you do that. That is like watching paint dry. The idea is that you come across these encounters throughout your travels. Keep in mind that you may need to wait a while in order to let everything respawn first.
  
  
Q - I'm new to mods. How do I install & uninstall Extra Encounters?
  
A - To install, place the files in the Skyrim/Data directory or install the mod through a mod manager such as Mod Organizer 2 (MO2) and enable it. To uninstall, delete the mod in a mod manager or the files in the Data directory.
  
  
Q - If I uninstall this mod, will it cause issues with my recent saves?
  
A - No. It has been tested. That being said, you should always backup your saves before you activate a mod, just in case. [font=Courier New][size=4]Keep in mind that uninstalling any mod can corrupt your save[/font].[/size]
  
  
Q - My game keeps crashing when this mod is enabled. Please help!
  
A - It's either a conflict with a mod, or you've accidentally got the load order wrong. Use [LOOT](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1918)﻿ to sort your mod load order. If the load order is correct and the problem persists, it is on your end. Refer to the compatibility section above.
  
  
Q - Can you make the spawn chance customizable?
  
A - No. Since the encounters do not rely on scripts, it will not happen.
  
  
Q - Can you make vampires only appear at night?
  
A - It has been attempted but it will not work. If anyone manages to fix it, please let me know in the comments and I will be sure to acknowledge you in the file description.
