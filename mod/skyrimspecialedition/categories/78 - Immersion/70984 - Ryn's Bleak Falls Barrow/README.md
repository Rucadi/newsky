My Goal
  
  
I love The Elder Scrolls series dearly, and I want to make my favorite game feel better for everyone. 
  
There are many other modders who do amazing things, and I feel like as a group we can make Skyrim feel new in EVERY way. 
  
My goal is to update many of the game's exteriors and/or interiors of commonly visited locations and dungeons throughout Skyrim, marked as ESL when available.

Ryn's Skyrim
  
  
An ongoing project to overhaul the entirety of Skyrim's Worldspace. This will initially released in individual files, then as large AOI files, then finally in the end I will provide an all encompassing AOI file that will contain everything.
  
This will inherently make the game **more** **difficult**, as additional enemy spawns will be placed to match the increased size of most locations.
  
The largest and most well known mods in the community will always be taken into consideration and I attempt to create a product that is either easily patched, or does not require a patch. 
  
  
I have full plans to create **open world bosses**, as well as bosses with their own **dungeons** or **worldspaces**. These bosses will massively range in difficulty, but know that open world bosses that you can easily wander into will never be on the most difficult side of the scale.
  
Bosses will potentially come with unique weapons, armors, or spells, as reward for defeating them.
  
These rewards will either be made by me, or be provided by other skilled Mod Authors.
  
  
Additional locations, are part of Ryn's Skyrim as well. New points of interest, new openworld dwellings, new dungeons and worldspaces.
  
The scope of this mod is***massive***, and will take time to be completed.

Ryn's Bleak Falls Barrow
  
  
A group of minor changes to the exterior of Bleak Falls Barrow, bringing life to the once abandoned Nordic ruin.
  
In the vanilla game, there is no sign of residency outside Bleak Falls's walls, not even a fire, which to me just didn't make sense.
  
The bandit sentries outside must get cold, no?
  
Suffer the cold, and the lack of realism, no more, bandits!

  
  

FAQ

  
Will you make a patch for \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?:
  
Maybe. If you are going to ask, please ask nicely. I'm a human before I am a modder. :)

Damn that's crazy.
  
  
How do I contact you about \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?:
  
You can message me here on the nexus, or message me on Discord. (At the bottom of this page)
  
  
I'm having *insert bug* issue. Can you help?:
  
Please put any issues in the bug section. They are far more likely to be taken care of that way.
  
  
Is this compatible with \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?
  
A list of major mods that it is/isn't compatible with will be available in time. Please be patient as I am one person and cannot test everything myself.
