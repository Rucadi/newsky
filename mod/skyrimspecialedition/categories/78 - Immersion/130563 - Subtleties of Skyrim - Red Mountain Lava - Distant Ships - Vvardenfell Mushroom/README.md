**Summary**
  

  
* You can now see lava on the [Vvardenfell](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Vvardenfell)﻿ Red Mountain.
Perhaps you will be able to see ships moving in the distance in the [Sea of Ghost](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Sea_of_Ghosts)﻿.
  
* You can now see some mushrooms on Vvardenfell Island. *Update 1.1*

**What is this rotten Mod name?**I had several ideas for mods in this style but I told myself that making several ESPs for small additions like that is restrictive. I decided to group them into one ESP and so I came up with a "catch-all" name "**Subtleties of Skyrim**". That way if I have other ideas like this I will add them there. (you can "**TRACK**" this mod in case there are other additions)
  
  
**Ok, but what if I only want the Lava or only the distant ships?**

**Details**
  
This mod adds things that work like a LOD.
  

  
* **Lava** on the [Vvardenfell](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Vvardenfell)﻿ Red Mountain. (Which gives the Dunmer one more reason not to return there.) Lava also works with ENB Light, so the intensity will depend on your ENB. In terms of polygons, the lava in "TamrielWorldSpace" is equivalent to displaying less one vanilla barrel, in "SolstheimWorldSpace" is equivalent to displaying one vanilla barrel.
Animated **Distant Ships** in the [Sea of Ghost](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Sea_of_Ghosts)﻿. With a long animation, to avoid giving away I won't say anything about their location or when/where you can see them. The goal of this addition is first to forget it and be surprised at some point in your game. So don't run to the Sea of ​​Ghost you won't see anything at the start of loading. In terms of polygons, equivalent to Vanilla ship LODs. 4 per Worldspace. I just added sails, 8 Tri by ship.
  
* Mushroom on the Vvardenfell island for Solstheim worldspace. In terms of polygons, is equivalent to displaying one SMIM barrel.

**How to disable lava or ships ?**
  

  
* In the **optional files** you will find empty meshes that disable these additions, their name starts with NO... Example: You don't want any ships in Solstheim, download the optional file "NO Solstheim Distant Ships" and ~~merge~~ into your mod organizer. To avoid having to repeat the procedure with each update, install in a second file placed after SoS.

**DynDOLOD Users**
  

  
* First of all, whether you use DynDOLOD or not, they are already LODs. Whatever happens, it will work directly.
~~You don't need to relaunch DynDOLOD, but if you do, disable this mod, I haven't tried but I guess DynDOLOD won't like this mod. Reactivate it after regeneration. OR (update) you find in the Misc Files "**DynDOLOD\_Rules**" a ini file which in theory will tell DynDOLOD to exclude this mod !~~ 
  
* "**DynDOLOD\_Rules**" a ini file which in theory will tell DynDOLOD to exclude this mod ! **Now include in the main file 1.0.2**

**Limitations**
  

  
* For Lava, in the TamrielWorlspace, the display limit is up to around Winterhold College. It's the same problem as for the display of the Volcano Plume with a mod that enables it in Skyrim.
For distant ships, the animation starts when the game loads, so if you save in front of a ship it won't be there when you restart the game.

**C****ompatibility**
  

  
* [Rudy HQ - More dramatic Red Mountain Plume](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89103)﻿ and [Red Mountain Plume Visible from Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66048)﻿ **YES** full compatible and perfect combo if you use Lava!
[Worldspace Transition Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48889) **YES** with the "**WTT\_Patch**" in the optional files﻿
  

  
  
  
Enjoy !
