My Goal
  
  
I love The Elder Scrolls series dearly, and I want to make my favorite game feel better for everyone. 
  
There are many other modders who do amazing things, and I feel like as a group we can make Skyrim feel new in EVERY way. 
  
My goal is to update, tweak, or entirely change most of the game's exteriors of commonly visited locations and dungeons throughout Skyrim, marked as ESL when available.
  
The scope of this project is massive, as I plan to redesign the experience you will have playing Skyrim. Whether you're a longtime veteran, or a totally new player, you will have something new, exciting, and more enjoyable to explore.

Ryn's Skyrim
  
  
An ongoing project to overhaul the entirety of Skyrim's Worldspace. This will initially released in individual files, then as large AOI files, then finally in the end I will provide an all encompassing AOI file that will contain everything.
  
This will inherently make the game **more** **difficult**, as additional enemy spawns will be placed to match the increased size of most locations. And certain enemies will be changed to be a bit more difficult. As well as totally new boss enemies being introduced.
  
The largest and most well known mods in the community will always be taken into consideration and I attempt to create a product that is either easily patched, or does not require a patch. However, I will not limit my creativity to accommodate other mods. I will only try to make it as easily patched as I can while completing my vision.
  
  
I have full plans to create **open world bosses**, as well as bosses with their own **dungeons** or **worldspaces**. These bosses will massively range in difficulty, but know that open world bosses that you can easily wander into will never be on the most difficult side of the scale.
  
Bosses will potentially come with unique weapons, armors, or spells, as reward for defeating them.
  
These rewards will either be made by me, or be provided by other skilled Mod Authors.
  
  
Additional locations, are part of Ryn's Skyrim as well. New points of interest, new openworld dwellings, new dungeons and worldspaces.
  
The scope of this mod is***massive***, and will take time to be completed. 
  
  
While completing this project, I will be releasing individual locations as I finish them so that the community can enjoy them. I will try my best to provide patches for other mods that are not created by me, though only the most "important" ones will I patch. When this project is complete, I will focus heavily on patches like that, *as to work with my end product* "**Ryn's Skyrim**".
  
Until then, I will be releasing patches that allow my own individual files to work seamlessly.
  
This project aims to redesign most of Skyrim and change your entire experience. So creating patches for tons of mods as I go will only slow the process. 
  
  
**Ryn's Skyrim** individual locations are meant to work on their own, so you can choose which you like and would like to stay away from. But in the end, all locations are meant to work together. Some locations will need patches that are necessary because of this. I will provide these patches.
  
These patches will not only include fixes to allow these files to work together, but will sometimes include interactions between the two original files. Small things usually.

MOD AUTHORS
  
I am always looking for others to work with. If you would like to help with this project, please contact me on the Nexus or on Discord. I am available in both places very often. Though mostly Discord. You will almost always get a reply from me on Discord within minutes.
  
  
I'm searching for **creators** to contribute assets such as **armors** and **weapons**. This includes already created mods you may wish the be included in some way in this project. I will ALWAYS provide clear and upfront credits to those who contribute. 
  
**Level Designers** that may want to join, I am not so interested in. If you feel so compelled though, again, feel free to contact me on the Nexus or on Discord.
  
  
  
  
Ryn's Standing Stones
  
  
The first AIO installment of my Ryn's Skyrim project.
  
Each Standing Stone location has been overhauled to be considerably more interesting and full of life. No longer are they empty and boring. With them being more interesting, it only makes sense that NPCs would find reason to seek them out. You'll find that some of these locations that were once safe and uninhabited, no longer are so free to approach. 
  
  
*This overhaul is **PURELY** cosmetic and does not change the effects of the Standing Stones. There will be no compatibility issues with mods that do so.*

  

FAQ

  
**Will you make a patch for \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?:**
  
Maybe. If you are going to ask, please ask nicely. I'm a human before I am a modder. :)
  
I focus heavily on creating new mods to add to this project, so creating patches for other mods is not on the top of my list, unless it is among the most important to have patched. If you would like niche mods to be patched, I'm sorry but you may have to seek other assistance. This project will take a very very long time as it is.
  
**If you put PATCH REQUESTS in the bug section, I will consider banning you from viewing any of my content.**
  
**I don't like this./This enemy is too hard. Can you change it for me?:**
  
Damn that's crazy.
  
  
**How do I contact you about \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?:**
  
You can message me here on the nexus, or message me on Discord. (At the bottom of this page)
  
  
**I'm having *insert bug* issue. Can you help?:**
  
Please put any issues in the bug section. They are far more likely to be taken care of that way. I see your comments. I read all of them. Seriously, I read every single comment. Adding your patch requests in the BUG section will make me considerably less likely to make the patch. 
  
  
**Can you make an AIO version containing all of your mods?**
  
Not yet. 
  
That is planned for later on and will come when I have the final creation of Ryn's Skyrim. Until then, no.
  
  
  
  
  

A Special Thank you

﻿A very special friend of mine who encouraged me to start modding.
  
Those who have helped encourage me, helped with feedback, and supported my work, thank you.
  
Without you, I do not think this project would continue.
  
As always, I love you, and happy modding.
