[font=Georgia]**What it does?**[/font]
  
  
Allows your character to cook at campfires or any other heat sources when using a cooking pot from the inventory.
  
An animation will play while the crafting menu is open.
  
  
[font=Georgia]**How it works?**[/font]
  
  
The "Cooking Pot" can be crafted at a forge by using two "Iron Ingots". You can also repurpose the vanilla "Cast Iron Pot" items at a forge.
  
To use the cooking pot, just stay near a heat source and use it from the inventory. If the mod recognizes the heat source, the animation
  
will play and the crafting menu will be opened.
  
  
There's also a "Makeshift Mortar and Pestle" misc item. You can craft it by repurposing a "Wooden Bowl" at a forge. Use the newly crafted item from the inventory to perform "Field Alchemy". P.S.: There's an alchemy penalty when using the item.
  
  
If you have Inventory [Interface Information Injector](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85702) and [The Handy Icon Collection Collective for I4](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90508)﻿, new icons will be added to the cooking pot and mortar and pestle.
  
  
If you have [Description Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/105799)﻿, flavor text will be added to the cooking pot and mortar and pestle.
  
  
If you have [Dynamic Animation Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33746) or [Open Animation Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92109) installed, an animation with the player holding the cooking pot will be
  
 played, otherwise, the player will kneel down near the heat source.
  
For now, it's just a simple cooking idle, but I have some ideas that I might implement in the future.
  
  
  
  
[font=Georgia]**Heat sources**[/font]
  
  
[Formlist Manipulator](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74037) can be used to add new heat sources to the FormLists, just add them to the Portable Cooking\_FLM.ini file.
  
Included heat sources from [Campfire](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/667), [Rest By Campfire BOS](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/96202), [Rain Extinguishes Fires](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80419)﻿ and [Diverse Campfires - Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/109731).
  
The "sizes" of the heat sources are just to determine how much closer the player needs to be when cooking, but I want to trigger different animations in the future.
  
  
[font=Georgia]**Inspiration**[/font]
  
  
The mod was inspired by the Primitive Cooking from [Hunterborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7900).
