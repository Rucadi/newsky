**ESL Flagged plugin.** This is a very simple mod. I’ve edited all of the applicable Imperial Fort exterior towers and walls meshes to include realistic merlons (crenellations).
  
  
**What this mod does:** It’s a full replacer of the meshes so any mod that adds Imperial Fort towers and walls will have these crenellations. It does contain some small edits in the ESL-flagged plugin where I had to revert some interior meshes back to vanilla where Bethesda put exterior walls in interior cells :) 
  
  
This was a little side project of mine to show myself proof of concept. I was surprised by the more realistic look and imposing difference the newly fortified towers and walls gave in game, so I’ve decided to release this. 
  
  
**Options to choose from:**
  
- Normal meshes version (main file) 
  
- T4’s Underground (T4gtr34um3r) custom edited meshes version.
  
- Parallax support meshes version meshes. To be used with things like pfuscher’s or WizKid forts.
  
- LOD Addon File, includes the necessary Lod files. For dyndolod users. 
  
  
**Compatibility:** this mod should be compatible with everything and simply enhance the look of vanilla and modded fort assets. However, Bethesda and Mod Authors use assets in many creative ways, so there might be a small oddity here and there, but the overall look should be much improved over vanilla.
  
  
**Inspiration:** The Conwy Castle in Wales is what I’ve always compared Bethesda’s imperial forts too. So this is my attempt to get that similar look for Skyrim’s forts.
