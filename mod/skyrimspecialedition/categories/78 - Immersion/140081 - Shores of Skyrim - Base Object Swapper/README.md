Hi everyone!
  
  
Have you ever walked the (empty) beaches that border on the Sea of Ghosts and thought, "I'd love to throw some stones in the sea" or, "I'd love to collect some shells for my seaside shack"? Well, now you can. This mod adds over two hundred hand placed shells, stones, pieces of driftwood and washed up shipwreck boards along the coast between Dawnstar and Solitude (up to about [Windstad Manor](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Windstad_Manor) at present).
  
  
Shells and rocks are swapped with Base Object Swapper and so the shoreline should vary whenever you load a new save. The shells and rocks sizes will also vary.
  
  
The mussels can be used as an ingredient in potions but so far there are no recipes for them. This is because I find mussels to be horrible and I can't imagine why anyone would want to eat them. I'll look into adding recipes in the future :) I'm also guessing that people may want to crush up the shells and use them in potions, this is something I may return to and add soon.
  
  
I highly recommend pairing this mod with [TB's 3D Driftwood](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80418) (there are optimized meshes available) as this mod was designed to work alongside it. I've even placed shells and rocks around the improved driftwood meshes.
  
  
This mod is intended to blend with a darker shoreline (as in [Northern Shores SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27041) or [Tomato's Complex Parallax Material Landscapes AIO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/110981)) and the colors of rocks and shells have been chosen accordingly. They may not blend quite so well with a lighter shoreline. 
  
  
Installation:
  
  
1) Download and install [Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805). The size and variation of shells and rocks are managed with BOS.
  
2) (Optional but highly recommended) Install [TB's 3D Driftwood](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80418).
  
3) Install both parts of this mod.
  
4) Enjoy!
  
  
Future plans:
  
  
Campfires and cooking fish on the beach.
  
More debris (ropes/fishing gear)
  
More rocks
