***"I'd had Eorlund forge this for Thorald. It was to be a present for his return. I suppose he can't have it now."*** -- Fralia Gray-Mane
  
  
  
After completing Missing In Action, Fralia will reward you with one of 21 random enchanted steel weapons that she claims Eorlund made for Thorald's return. Why would Eorlund make a regular steel weapon instead of Skyforge steel for his own son? Fralia has a Skyforge steel dagger. Avulstein, his other son, wields a Skyforge steel battleaxe. Why not Thorald? It just didn't really make sense to me.
  
  
  
This simple patch will add enchanted Skyforge steel equivalents of all 21 of the potential reward weapons and swap out the steel in the reward list with said Skyforge steel equivalents.
