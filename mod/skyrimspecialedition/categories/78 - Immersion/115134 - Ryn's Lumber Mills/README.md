[font=Georgia]Part of Ryn's Skyrim
  
  
An ongoing project with the goal of bringing Skyrim's Worldspace to a more updated level of detail with new locations, improved locations, and more interesting encounters, all while generally sticking to Bethesda's style of level design, and with performance and mod compatibility for the average player in mind.

While not the most exciting, Skyrim's Lumber mills play a fun part of environmental storytelling in its wilderness. 
  
While keeping to a very strict set of rules for compatibility and game stability, I've enhanced all of Skyrim's standalone Lumber Mills to be more detailed feel more lived-in, and give more definitive borders to where the mill owner's land begins and ends, while also fixing countless small bugs and inconsistencies in all areas. Bugs and inconsistencies include lighting issues where lights are not placed in a correct spot, causing very flat lighting, navmesh issue where NPCs could not find their way, Z-fighting where two textures clash and cause flickering, and visible holes in and beneath assets.
  
All of this while keeping performance in mind, by not needlessly over-cluttering, and by adding significant occlusion cubes in meaningful areas surrounding the mills.

I purposefully did not include mills which are attached to cities, as to not create incompatibilities with city mods.
