﻿[font=Trebuchet MS]What this mod does
  
  
The town of Raven Rock (Dragonborn DLC) now takes its name from a raven-shaped rock formation.
  
I created one by using regular rocks, to which I added the typical volcanic ash effect.
  
  
[/font][font=Trebuchet MS]These are purely vanilla assets, so the appearance of the Raven will change
  
according to the rock retextures you may have installed.
  
[/font][font=Trebuchet MS]
  
You can jump and hike and reach the top of the Raven's head, where you will find a ruby ore vein. 
  
The rock formation is also visible from any distance.
  
  
  
  
Compatibility
  
  
This mod should be compatible with everything,
  
unless there's a mod that edits that particular spot on the mountain ridge.
  
In this (I hope unlikely) case, please let me know! :)
