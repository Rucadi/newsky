[font=Comic Sans MS]**~ Description ~**[/font]

  

Flying crows have been added to more than 30 various points of interest throughout the land of Skyrim. Each crow has been hand-placed and will dynamically react to the time of day as well as current weather conditions, disappearing during inclement weather and reappearing when clear, cloudy, or foggy.
  
  
During your travels you will encounter [murders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Crows)﻿ of various sizes, some are sparse while others are far more impressive in scale. What's more is you'll never be quite sure when to expect them so each time your feet meet a familiar path, keep your eyes on the sky, as what's overhead may not appear the same as your last visit. 
  
  
**[font=Comic Sans MS]~ Requirements ~[/font]**
  
  
[powerofthree's Papyrus Extender SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22854?tab=description)Tested on v5.8.0. For Flying Crows V2.0 above.﻿
  
  
[B.E.E.S](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441)Only for those who are on older versions of Skyrim (Prior to 1.6.1130).﻿
  
  
[DynDolod 3.0](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68518)Required for Crow LOD, and highly suggested. It's not nearly as scary as it seems.﻿
  
  
[font=Comic Sans MS]**~ How it Works ~**[/font]
  
\* Each crow model is associated with a specific parent X Marker
  
\* Each X Marker is associated with a lightweight script that determines when the crows will appear
  
\* The script will call twice per day, per X Marker, as well as when one weather transitions to another, this includes weather changing via fast travel.
  
  
  
[font=Comic Sans MS]**~ FAQ ~**[/font]
  
  
**\* Why are the crows so F#&\*ING LOUD?**
  
  
Because. But also, check out the in-game sound/audio settings. A volume slider was added in v 1.2 to adjust to your preference.
  
  
**\* Why do I have to adjust the sound settings each time I start a new game?**
  
  
I've heard this complaint previously but haven't been able to replicate it. All my audio settings seem to persist when reloading the game, would be interested in feedback if multiple people experience this. 
  
  
**\* Why are the wings flapping in unison?**
  
  
They're not. All joking aside, there are likely a few that flap at the same time in the larger murders but it won't be all of them.
  
  
**\* Do I REALLY NEED DynDolod!?!?**
  
  
If you want suitable LOD for the crows, then yes. This mod will 100% function without it, but its SOOO much better with DynDolod.
  
  
**\* When/Where should I see crows?**
  
  
Depending on the crow and location, they can be seen at various times between 6 AM and 9 PM. And as of v2.0 crows will not appear during inclement weather.(rain/snow). The most prominent places to verify would be outside the entrance to Windhelm and/or Whiterun.
  
  
**\* I Don't see any Crows ANYWHERE!?!?!**
  
  
First, test with just this mod and its requirements loaded and verify if you see crows.
  
*If they don't appear:*
  
  
you're either missing PO3's Papyrus Extender, the mod isn't actually enabled (assets & ESP), or the mod was corrupted during download and you should redownload.
  
  
*If they do appear:*
  
  
Test with the rest of your modlist, and presumably DynDolod. If they don't show up, make sure you're on the latest version of DynDolod. If you are already on the newest version, go to the [DynDolod support forums](https://stepmodifications.org/forum/forum/223-dyndolod-xlodgen/)﻿ and notify Sheson, its likely a bug has occurred.
  
  
**\* I have a bug that isn't listed here**
  
  
Please submit a "Bug Report" with:
  
  
- Game Version
  
- Mod Manager
  
- PO3 Papyrus Extender Version
  
- Description of the issue
  
- Any other technical info
