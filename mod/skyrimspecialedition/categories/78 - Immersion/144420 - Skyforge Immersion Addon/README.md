**Adds a few lines of fully voiced dialogue. All created with vanilla assets. Minimal splicing and no AI was used.
  
  
Mod Overview**The Skyforge is supposed to be the best forge in all of Skyrim, but the only thing differentiating it from other forges is that it can make steel weapons that have elven stats.
  
  
Enter **Skyforge Immersion Addon**, where the Skyforge is *actually* the best forge in all of Skyrim. 
  

  
* When near the Skyforge all weapons and amor can be improved 5% better. (When a certain Companion member dies, this buff increases to 10%).

**OPTIONAL:** To balance this change and make it feel earned, players must now ask Eorlund for permission to use the Skyforge through newly added dialogue.
  
With this option enabled, you can only use the forge after proving yourself by completing one of the following:
  

  
* Becoming a member of the Circle in the Companions. (Completing *The Silver Hand* quest).
Completing the *Missing in Action* Side Quest.
  

  
**Compatibility**This mod is compatible with all city overhauls and Skyforge mods. 
  
*In fact, I recommend Installing one that adds a workbench near the forge so you can fully utilize the new buff.*
  
**No vanilla records were modified so it should be compatible with all mods.**
  
  
**Requirements**
  
[powerofthree's Papyrus Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22854)(only required if you want to limit access to the forge until you've completed one of the quests)
  
  
**Installation**Safe to install mid-game.
  
Just install with your preferred mod manager, position in load order is irrelevant.
