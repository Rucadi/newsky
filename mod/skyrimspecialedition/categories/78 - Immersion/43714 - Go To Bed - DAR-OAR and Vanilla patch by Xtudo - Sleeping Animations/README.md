Go to Bed - DAR patch
  
by Xtudo****Description**
  
This mod will use **Dynamic Animation Replacer** to randomize the 04 bed and 03 bedroll animations from the wonderful mod **Go To Bed** by Andrelo1.
  
It will use the 03 new bed animations from Go To Bed plus 01 from vanilla. And the new 02 bedroll animations from Go To Bed plus 01 from vanilla.
  
It works perfectly with**Open Animation Replacer (OAR)**.
  
All Kudos to [Andrelo1](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/15685024) and to [Felisky384](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/19968244) for their awesome work.
  
**PLAYER and NPCs** version added (thanks to [johnwhite92](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/33111493) for the heads-up).
  
  
**This mod will work even without Go to Bed installed:**It will circle between the animations on a vanilla game too.
  
Fully compatible with [Use Those Blankets](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/75481) too.
  
  
**I made it for my game and now I'm sharing it, I hope you like it.**
  
*Don't forget to endorse and share your screens. :)*
  
  
**Installation**
  

  
* Choose your version, **PLAYER only** or **PLAYER and NPCs** (install only one).
Extract the downloaded RAR file and copy the DATA folder to your Skyrim installation folder.
  
* **IMPORTANT:** When installing Go To Bed, leave the vanilla animations, select *"Don't install custom sleeping animation".*
If you already have the animations installed, go to your Data\Meshes\Actors\Character\Animations folder, and delete this five files: bed\_leftsleep.hkx, bed\_rightsleep.hkx, bedroll\_frontsleep.hkx, bedroll\_leftsleep.hkx and bedroll\_rightsleep.hkx.
  

  
**Requirements**
  

  
* [Go to bed by Andrelo1](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4224)﻿﻿ v1.5.3 (SE version) or v2.0.7 (AE version). Works with Vanilla too.
[Dynamic Animation Replacer by Felisky384](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33746) or [Open Animation Replacer by Ershin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92109)﻿.
  
* Optional: ﻿﻿[Sleeping Expanded - Animations and NPC reactions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59250)﻿.
Optional: [Use Those Blankets](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/75481)﻿.
  

  
**Conflicts**
  
The DAR folder numbers conflict with [(SGC) SkySA - Combat Behavior Compulsion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31390), specifically 3000, 3001, 3002.
  
So the best thing to do is to rename the folders of my mod to 3080, 3081, 3082, 3083, and 3084, BEFORE installing them into your Skyrim Data folder. Many thanks to **nousernameplease** for the heads-up.
