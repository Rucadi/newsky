This patch adds an OStim scene after the wedding, right before the screen fades to black.
  
  
There is also an optional patch to replace the fake bedroll in the wedding tent with a real one so OStim can use it for the scene. This shouldn't break anything, but it's probably best not to sleep in it.
  
  
This mod edits the "mrtstage8script" script, but should otherwise be compatible with most other M'rissi addons.
