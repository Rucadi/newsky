Adds conditions so only lawful characters can start the Heart of Crimson quest from [CC Ebony Plate](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Alternative_Armors_-_Ebony_Plate).
  
  
  
To get the Ebony Plate armor from Creation Club you need to complete the [Heart of Crimson](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Heart_of_Crimson) quest. You'll receive a [letter](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Letter_from_Tyra_Blood-Fire) where she states she knows your story and wants you to be the judge for her actions.
  
This mod simply adds conditions so that characters who committed serious crimes won't ever receive the letter.
  
  
**Conditions to receive the quest:**
  
Spoiler
  
Less than 2 murders
  
5000 or less lifetime bounty
  
  
  
  
Compatible with [Rebalancing Anniversary Edition - Quest Requirements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61004) with the RAE version
