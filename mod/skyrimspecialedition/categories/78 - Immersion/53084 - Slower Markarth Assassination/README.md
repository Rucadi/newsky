# Slower Markarth Assassination

**WHAT THIS MOD DOES**
  
Moves a single idle marker a little farther to the left. This is the idle marker tied to Weylin's starting point when the player first loads into Markarth and Weylin attempts to assassinate Margret in the market.
  
  
**WHY THIS MOD EXISTS**
  
I am a big fan of being a hero. So I always try to stop Weylin whenever I first go to Markarth and usually I can but sometimes something goes wrong and I have to reload a save or something. This just gives the player some more time to be the hero and save Margret's life. We already have executions in Helgen and Solitude, do we really need for a poor defenseless woman at the market to endure the same just to make a point about how bad the Forsworn might be? I say "Nay!" and so now you can take a little extra time to make sure Weylin is stopped before he even gets close.

**WARNING**
  
I don't actually know if that idle marker is tied to anything else. I couldn't find anything and it was in an usual place so I just kind of assumed it was safe to move. Let me know if you encounter any problems with it and I'll see if I can find a way to make it a bit better, otherwise this is a one-and-done mod for funsies. Should be compatible with anything that doesn't move or undo the move I made to that idle marker. Cleaned with xEdit - no other changes made.
  
  
The files also received a name change shortly after I uploaded it. If you were one of the first to download this mod, then make sure to remove the old file completely prior to downloading and installing the new one or their could be conflicts. The contents of the file itself didn't change though, and I don't think this will need any updates any time soon so you should also be fine sticking with the original file as needed.
