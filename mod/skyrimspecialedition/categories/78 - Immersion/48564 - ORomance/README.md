Ready for some *real* immersion?
  
  
ORomance is a massive mod, there's no way to explain all of it's new features here, but here's the big ones:
  
  
- Dating, romance, and seduction mechanics in Skyrim. Loosely based off of classic dating sims
  
- **A brand new UI** built from the ground up to make navigating ORomance's many options a breeze
  
- A new relationship type, girlfriend or boyfriend, acts as an intermediate between friends and marriage
  
- divorce/breakup/cheating/multiple partners/threesomes, all features in ORomance
  
- EVERY NPC is romancable/seducable/marriable, even those NPCs added in new mods (some NPCs may be hard to get, see below)
  
- Brand new custom stats (over 10) and personalities procedurally generated for each npc, because Skyrim's relationship mechanics were far too basic
  
- NPCs have an opinion/"memory" of you that will fade over time for small actions, but they will remember some things you do with them forever
  
- Loads of new interaction options with NPCs
  
- Prostitution, where you can pay different prices for different sex acts
  
- Ultra-tight OStim integration, your actions inside sex scenes affect your relationship
  
- Followers like you the more you travel with them
  
- Optional NPC sexualities (heterosexual/bisexual/homosexual) that affects their preferences in the player
  
- Loads of small immersive tweaks that tie into the game's vanilla systems. Becoming a thane makes you more popular around town? Of course. Not being orc-kin makes seducing orcs harder? Absolutely. Doing quests for NPCs makes starting relationships with them easier? Yep.
  
- Heavy emphasis on small immersive features

﻿
  

﻿

  
**How it works**To start ORomance, simply approach an NPC and press the ORomance hotkey while facing them. This will start a special dialogue with the ORomance menu available. You now have many options available to you
  
  
**Romance**
  
- Try to seduce
  
If you succeed, you the npc will ask you to lead them to an area to have sex in. Press the ORomance key on the NPC while they are following you to start the OStim sex scene.
  
  
Typically, approaching random NPCs and trying to seduce them will fail unless your speech stat is extremely high. Some (but not all) NPCs much prefer that you start a relationship with them before they will have sex with you. Some NPCs, do however, prefer being a friend-with-benefits, and will let you seduce them long before they will agree to a relationship with you.
  
  
-Try to kiss
  
If you succeed, you will kiss the NPC. This makes them like you quite a bit more, and therefore will make other actions easier to perform after this. 
  
  
Most NPCs will prefer to kiss you before they agree to full-on sex, but some of them aren't a fan of lovey-dovey stuff, and will prefer to just have sex.
  
  
- Prostitution
  
For when you need a quick fix. This only appears if an NPC is a prostitute. For example, tavern wenches are prostitutes. Other NPCs are marked as prostitutes as well, so ask around
  
You can select if you would like a handjob, blowjob, or full control. The options get more expensive depending on which you pick.  You can expect to pay a few hundred gold at least
  
  
**Interact**
  
- ***Inquire***
  
﻿- Ask about sexual experience
  
The NPC will tell you about their sexlife and/or thoughts on sex. You can get some information about them and their personality type based on their response. If an NPC is not familiar with you at all, they may refuse to answer.
  
  
- Ask about current relationships
  
The NPC will tell you if they're married or single
  
  
- Ask about sexuality
  
The npc will tell you their sexual preferences. If an NPC is not familiar with you at all, they may refuse to answer. 
  
  
- ***Relationship***
  
-Confess Love
  
This will ask the NPC to become your boyfriend or girlfriend. Some NPCs are more comfortable with this than others. After an NPC is in a relationship with you, they are far more likely to be down for things like sex and kissing if they weren't before. Be warned though, if they see you getting physical with someone else, they will get angry with you and possibly break up
  
  
-Propose marriage
  
If the NPC accepts, this will start the vanilla wedding quest with them.
  
A small minority of NPCs will not have sex until marriage. NPCs that are married to you will do just about anything with you. Be careful though, if they see you cheating they can still divorce you
  
  
- Divorce/breakup
  
Does what it says. NPC will hate you afterwards. May be impossible to get back with them after this, so choose wisely.
  
  
- Give gift
  
"AAA YES I CAN'T WAIT TO GIVE EVERYONE I WANT TO SEDUCE 20 DIAMONDS AND WIN THEM OVER INSTANTLY"
  
Not how this feature works. Giving NPCs small gifts will temporarily boost how much they like you. The amount that it can boost is capped pretty low if the NPC is not your partner or spouse, so don't go wasting 1000 septim gifts on random NPCs.
  
  
-Compliment/insult
  
These give tiny boosts to how much an npc likes or dislikes you. Spamming them will make an NPC get annoyed with you. More effective if an NPC is already your partner or spouse
  
  
**Skyrim's relationship system, versus ORomance's**Skyrim has a rudimentary relationship system, where NPCs have a number assigned to them that essential represents what they think of you. It ranges from -4 to 4, with -4 being an enemy, 0 being a stranger, and 4 being a lover. This system was not nearly advanced enough for what ORomance wants to do, so many new stats were added to the game, including but not limited to:
  
- How much an NPC likes you
  
- How much an NPC desires sex
  
- How much an NPC is willing to talk about sex in public
  
- How much an NPC wants to be in a loving relationship
  
- If an NPC is willing to have sex with you before being in a relationship, or married
  
- How much an NPC is willing to cheat if they're married to another NPC
  
- How much an NPC hates you
  
- How much an NPC loves you
  
- Other seduction difficulty modifiers based on their status and who they are
  
- More
  
  
ORomance still keeps track of vanilla's relationship system, however. So things that affect the vanilla system will affect ORomance and vice versa, for compatibility!
  
  
  
**Player Charisma**
  
The number 1 thing that determines generally how successful you are at starting relationships and seducing NPCs is a hidden stat called your charisma. Your charisma is tied to your actions throughout your playthrough of Skyrim. Having very low charisma means you will be able to get almost nowhere with most NPCs. With an average/medium charisma value, you should be able to start consistently having success with NPCs that you spend time interacting with, traveling with, or doing quests for, depending on their stats and what they like. High charisma characters will be able to sometimes seduce NPCs on first meeting them.
  
  
What affects your charisma? The following things increase your charisma stat, from most to least (roughly):
  
- Increasing speech
  
- Leveling up
  
- Becoming a thane in an area (is extra effective with NPCs that live in that specific area)
  
- Purchasing and owning property
  
- Ending the civil war/killing alduin.
  
  
Remember though - charisma is only half of the equation. An NPC's personality stats, opinions of you, preferences, marital status, and much more heavily affect your success with them. See the getting started section down below for more info on playing effectively. 
  
  
**Seduction and kissing**
  
If an NPC agrees to have sex with you, they will allow you to lead them to a private area of your choosing. Opening the ORomance menu on this NPC while they follow you will allow you to begin the OStim sex scene.
  
  
You can also perform a kiss with an NPC. This has a very positive effect on your relationship with said NPC. Thanks to it's versatility, kissing animations are processed and managed by OStim. 
  
  
You can also start a threesome. To do this, seduce an NPC while one is already seduced and following you. Note, if you are in a relationship with one or both NPCs, the threesome will fail unless both NPCs have a personality that is OK with cheating. Starting threesomes with NPCs that are not in a relationship with you works best.
  
  
**Success and failure**Normally, there's no indication that an ORomance action will succeed or fail (other than what you've inferred from Inquire and such). However, once an NPC becomes your partner, OR your speech level reaches level 50, you will gain the ability to loosely tell if an action will pass or not. This is indicated by selecting an option, then checking the color of an NPC's name at the bottom of the screen. The colors indicate the following:
  
  
Red - This action will no doubt fail
  
Yellow - This action may fail or succeed. If it fails, that NPC is "on the fence" about you, so you are somewhat close. Remember there is no RNG in these options, so if something is yellow, don't spam it, it will not succeed by doing it over and over again without changing anything
  
Green - This action will definitely succeed 
  
  
Since failing most actions gives you a temporary dislike penalty with that NPC, gaining this ability is very useful.
  
A colorless indicator is available in the MCM if you have trouble seeing the colors
  
  
**Cheating**If one isn't enough for you, you can always choose to sleep around. You can also steal some NPCs spouses.
  
  
Player cheating
  
You can have as many girlfriends and boyfriends as you like. However, if one of them sees you getting physical with someone else, they will usually get angry and sometimes break up with you. NPCs that do not care much for monogamous relationships may not care and give you a pass, but these NPCs are rare.
  
When an NPC is angry at you, via cheating, insulting them over and over, or something else, you will not be able to interact with them and will have to wait for them to forgive you, or apologize to them over and over. Some NPCs may never forgive you.
  
If you want to do a harem type playthrough, you can seduce NPCs without making them your boyfriend/girlfriend. Doing this lets you freely have sex with them in from of each other. However, seducing NPCs without starting a relationship with them is more difficult (but entirely doable)
  
  
Stealing other's wives/husbands
  
Married NPCs are usually in a happy and satisfactory relationship. Seducing these NPCs is not realistically possible. It is technically possible to have a relationship and/or seduce any NPC if your player charisma is high enough. However, the level required to seduce most of these NPCs is not attainable for all but the longest running player characters. 
  
BUT. Some married NPCs (less than half, more than 1%) are willing to cheat if the right player comes along. Furthermore, some of these married NPCs are actually looking to cheat, and seducing them may be especially easy. Be careful though, if their spouse catches you in the act of having sex with their wife or husband, they will most likely get *extremely* angry. Fortunately most NPCs will refuse to start sex if they know their spouse is around (ultra horny NPCs don't care and will start sex regardless).
  
You can start relationships and even get married to these cheating NPCs, but it is even more difficult than seducing them. Killing a married npc's spouse makes them easier to seduce as long as you aren't caught. 
  
  
**Opinions and memories**When interacting with an NPC, you may see one of two little icons pop up at the bottom of the screen. These either indicate that the action you tried to perform was successful or failed, or the NPCs opinion of you has gone up or down. Or both. Over many days, an NPC's opinion of you will slowly return to neutral. However, sometimes, some actions leave a permeant memory on the NPC these memories permanently affect the NPC's opinion of you.
  
Generally, being in a relationship or being married to an NPC makes it much easier to rack up "positive" thoughts about you. NPCs who you know casually will have less strong feelings towards you, but you can still leave permanent memories on them (i.e. having sex and giving them an orgasm).
  
  
**Boyfriends, girlfriends, and marriage**With the Confess Love option, you can start a relationship with an NPC. Some NPCs prefer not to have sex before being in a relationship, so if you wish to have sex with those NPCs, you either need to form a relationship first, or have extremely high charisma.
  
You can also propose marriage to NPCs. Getting an NPC to accept that does not have a very high opinion of you, and also is in a relationship with you, is very difficult.
  
  
**Inquiry**
  
You can ask NPCs some questions about themselves, including their sexuality, if they're in a relationship, and their thoughts on sex. Their answers may help you guess how seducable they are. For example, married NPCs may sometimes comment that they are unhappy with their marriage (but they won't always, even if they are)! Quite often though, if an NPC doesn't know you at all, they will refuse to answer some questions you ask them.
  
  
**Prostitution**
  
Some NPCs are prostitutes. Whether or not they're a prostitute depends on their job. Tavern wenches, for example, are marked as prostitutes. Other types of NPCs are as well, but you will have to explore around to find them. Prices vary from prostitute to prostitute, and they also vary based on which sex act you select. When you select an act such as a blowjob, you will start a special, locked OStim scene that you can't control, and you will receive your service.
  
  
**Sexualities**
  
By default, all NPCs are bisexual. With the sexuality setting on, some NPCs are heterosexual and homosexual. It works about how you would expect - if an NPC isn't attracted to your gender, seducing them is basically impossible. So if an NPC isn't attracted to your gender, you pretty much can't do anything ORomance-related with them. You can ask their sexual preferences with the Inquire feature to find out what they prefer.
  
Percentage distribution is based off of real life survey data.
  
  
**Ultra-tight OStim integration**Several actions you perform during OStim sex scenes can affect your relationship with an NPC.
  
  
**Integration with other mods that start sex scenes**Let's say you have a quest mod that leads to you having sex with an NPC. Afterwards, as long as that quest played an OStim scene, ORomance will recognize this, and make said NPC easier to seduce for you, to keep immersion (otherwise, you would have a relationship with said NPC in the quest, but ORomance would not reflect that at all which would seem strange). 
  
  
**Getting Started**Here are a few things you should know about the mechanics:
  
  
- There is no RNG in the success "rolls". That is to say, if you fail an action, repeating it immediately after, or savescumming and reloading will not affect the outcome at all.
  
- Low-level characters will fail. A lot. In fact, I recommend reaching level 5 and speech level 35 before even starting to try. Getting to speech level 50 is recommended. Enchanted gear that raises speech should work.
  
- Completing quests they offer is generally (but not always) the single best way to get an NPC to like you. Leveling up your speech is the second best, and works consistently across all NPCs. Travelling with them is also good if they are a follower.
  
- If an NPC is in a happy marriage, or if an NPC is not attracted to your character (i.e. a female character is a lesbian and you are a male character), you will probably not be able to seduce these NPCs. *Technically,* if your level and speech are high enough it is always possible, but it is not practical and may not be possible with vanilla level caps. 
  
  
In-depth guide
  
[Here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/3047). This guide is for people that want to know the innerworkings of the mod. As a casual user I advise not reading this
  
  
**Difficulty tweaking & the MCM**ORomance settings appear in the add-ons tab of OStim's MCM
  
  
Want a more laid back experience? Raising the difficulty modifier will make things easier. My personal recommendation is to do a full playthrough at the default difficulty, then tweak the difficulty, but you can do what you please. Here's roughly how some settings will translate:
  
  
0 - The standard. Early game will be tough. By midgame you'll be able to seduce a lot of NPCs that are familiar with you. By late game you should start being able to easily seduce most NPCs
  
30 - This will make things slightly easier, as well as let low level characters get started with ORomance fairly early on. Overall though, won't make things too much easier
  
60 - From here, low level characters can get started with ORomance right away. By mid-game, you should be able to seduce a pretty good chunk of NPCs easily
  
90 - At this difficulty, you'll be able to have quite a bit of success with a lot of NPCs even at level 1. By midgame you'll no doubt be able to seduce nearly all NPCs
  
  
Values above 90 will mostly be a cakewalk.
  
With higher negative values you may not seduce anyone at all until the very late game.
  
  
**Controls**By default, K on an npc starts a dialogue and left/right changes options. These are changeable by MCM
  
Your normal skyrim controls select options, and exit the menu. By default this is going to be E and tab.
  
  
Controller supported.
  
  
**FAQ**>Menus are taking a while to load? I have an older CPU
  
Menus are cached the first time you open them, so they will be snappier on subsequent uses. Additionally, this cache has to be loaded up when you reload a save, so upon starting a ORomance dialogue for the first time after loading a save, there will be a brief pause while the cache is fetched.
  
  
>Is this compatible with FG?
  
Technically, yes. However since the mods do the same thing, you should select one or the other for the best and most immersive, balanced experience.
  
If you're caught on FG-dependent mods, many of them have OStim ports. Check the OStim page for a list of known ports
  
  
>Will this play Sexlab animations? Will this play FG animations?
  
No
  
  
>Will sex from other sex animation frameworks affect my relationship with the npc at all?
  
No, it will be like it never happened
  
  
>Is this script heavy? Surely this is script heavy??
  
No, scripts don't run at all unless a ORomance menu is open or an OStim scene is running thanks to some tricky math and modern tech. 
  
  
>I can't seduce ANYONE
  
You're either low level or you're mid-level and  just going up to random NPCs and hitting Try to Seduce without them knowing you at all
  
  
>Does this contain NPC on NPC interactions?
  
Not many, that will be a separate mod
  
  
>ESL?
  
No, *don't* ESL-flag this mod
  
  
>Can I install this mid-game?
  
Yes. Note however, that when you do that your player charisma value will not be starting at 0, so depending on how far into a playthrough you are, you will be skipping over the "hard" parts. As long as your speech is under 50, you probably won't notice a difference though.
  
  
>Why use a custom UI instead of the vanilla dialogue system?
  
Vanilla dialogue is very slow to navigate, and annoying to program with. ORomance's UI also allows other features like small popups on failure/success. Vanilla dialogue is also prone to clutter. Additionally, NPCs still speak lines in the UI occasionally, so I'm overall quite pleased with how it turned out compared to how it would have looked and felt with the vanilla dialogue system.
  
  
>Using the menu has some latency
  
ORomance is tested to be snappy on a fairly script heavy setup with an older cpu. However, like with many UI mods, framerates under 60 can induce some noticeable latency. Keeping your FPS high on heavy setups is always recommended, not because it looks better, but to keep the script engine running properly under heavy load (script processing is tied to framerate so low framerates have a compounding effect on script lag).
  
  
>I don't have an addons tab in my MCM
  
Your ostim version is out of date
  
  
> After I have sex with my partner they accuse me of cheating
  
This happens if you do a clean update procedure on OStim without removing ORomance alongside it. Just do a clean reinstall procedure on ORomance. Your progress will be saved. Next time you update OStim, make sure the addons are unchecked when you do it
  
  
>Nothing happens when I press the dialogue key. **I have double checked and made sure the requirements were installed at the time of installation**
  
Somehow the install failed, the following procedure fixes that:
  
1. Disable Oromance in your mod manager2. Launch the game and it will complain about missing mods.
  
3. Play the game for a minute or two. Run around, change cells, etc.
  
4. Save the game.
  
5. Open that new save in ReSaver (Fallrim Tools) and clean it.
  
6. Install/ renable ORomance again
  
7. Launch game.
  
8. Load the clean save you made.
  
9. Try it. you should get the oromance installed message on screen. 
  
  
**Requirements**- OViriginity (and ocum as a requirement of OVirginity)
  
 ﻿- This mod tracks NPC sexual experience which factors into their personality profile. 
  
 ﻿- TECHNICALLY, I believe ORomance functions without this mod. However, prostitution options won't appear
  
 ﻿ ﻿- If you experience any issue with ORomance not starting, please **immediately** exit and install this mod
  
 ﻿ ﻿-  OVirginity's page has an effect disabler optional file that removes the visuals as well.
  
- OStim
  
- iWant Widgets
  
**Credits and thanks**First, thank you to my patrons that allow me to continue work on mods like this. Without your support, this mod would have never been made. Seriously, you would not be reading this mod page right now if not for their support.
  
  
Thank you to DaemonPrime for your work on iWant Widgets. This mod would look far different without your mod. Modder resources and libraries like these are vastly underrated, underutilized,  and underappreciated by the community at large. I hope my mod here sheds light onto what yours is capable of.
  
  
Thank you to all of the friendly users on discord who have helped this project in small ways.
