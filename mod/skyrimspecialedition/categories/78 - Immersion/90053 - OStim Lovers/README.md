[font=Verdana]**![](https://i.imgur.com/bWDRFE6.png)****What is OStim Lovers?**[/font][font=Verdana]
  
OStim Lovers adds sexual flavor to the game by introducing fully-voiced lover dialogue to various NPCs after vanilla quests associated with them have been completed. This includes being able to have a fling with Hadvar/Ralof after your escape from Helgen or even becoming the mistress of a Jarl after becoming their Thane! Such an approach allows for a natural and seamless integration of romantic encounters into the game, rewarding the Dragonborn for continued progression on a playthrough. 
  
  
The lover dialogue added by this mod was written in a way that fits closely with the existing universe and the player-NPC relationship context in the vanilla game (with some creative liberties). The overall tone is tamer and less whimsical than Amorous Adventures, however, some crass dialogue for certain NPCs are also present. All dialogue is fully voiced through a combination of vanilla lines, spliced lines, and AI generated lines. There is *extensive* manual editing involved on my part to make sure the lines sound authentic and non-robotic.
  
  
**Currently, all female NPC lover dialogue covered by the mod are sex-neutral and appropriate for either a male or female Dragonborn.** **However, some male NPC dialogue are oriented specifically towards a female Dragonborn. Lover dialogue for each NPC can be enabled/disabled to the player's liking via the MCM.**

**How do I unlock lover dialogue?**[/font][font=Verdana]You must complete certain vanilla quests associated with that NPC. As an example: becoming the Thane of Haafingar and completing the Bard’s College quest “Tending the Flames” will unlock dialogue with Jarl Elisif to have her become your lover. Pursuing this conversation will then allow the player to initiate OStim scenes with Jarl Elisif via dialogue, as well as unlock the Jarl’s Allowance and Jarl’s Pardon features for the Haafingar Hold.

**Dialogue Previews:**
  
  
[/font][font=Verdana]
  
**How can I customize this mod?**[font=Verdana][size=3]**If you only want to see female lover dialogue or vice versa, you can now disable it.** [/font]As of Version 1.1, an MCM is now available which will allow the player to enable/disable lover dialogue for each NPC at any time.**![](https://i.imgur.com/h0LOeSQ.png)**[/size]**How stable is this mod?**[/font][font=Verdana]
  
**OStim Lovers was designed on the pillars of being simple and stable.** This mod is essentially composed of dialogue lines and dialogue scripts. It will not cause any crashes. It will not bloat your save on long playthroughs. All scripts in the mod only fire once either at the start or end of dialogue, and does NOT run at any other point in time.
  
  
[/font][font=Verdana]**H**[/font][font=Verdana]**ow do I install/uninstall this mod?**[/font][font=Verdana][/font][font=Verdana]OStim lovers is very low impact and safe to install/uninstall mid-playthrough. However, [font=Verdana][size=3]it is best practice to start a new game after installing/uninstalling any mod. [/font]NOTE: Updating is only advised between minor updates (e.g. 1.7 to 1.7.1) or when no new Lover NPCs are added. The MCM may take time to load after updating.

[font=Verdana]**Is this compatible with X mod?**[/font][font=Verdana]
  
**There should be no hard incompatibilities that are game breaking because this mod is rather self-contained.** The worst thing that can happen from a conflict is that some of the dialogue added by this mod will not show up. Examples of mods that may cause such conflicts include:
  
[/font]

  
* [font=Verdana]You have a mod that drastically alters some of the vanilla quest stages[/font]
[font=Verdana]You have a mod that alters the vanilla allegiances of Jarls in Skyrim[/font]
  
* [font=Verdana]Crime overhaul mods that alter vanilla arrest dialogue may disable the Jarl’s Pardon and Guard Seduction features[/font]
[font=Verdana]Dark Brotherhood mods that allow you to save DB members (OStim Lovers has its own mechanic for this). In order to avoid duplicate NPCs and redundancy, you have the option to disable DB members' lover dialogue in the MCM.[/font]

***As with any mod I make: I am letting anyone create patches or other modifications so long as credit to the original mod is provided and the original mod is listed as a requirement***
  
  
**FAQ**[/font][font=Verdana]
  
**[font=Verdana][size=3][b]Is this mod suitable for a male heterosexual Dragonborn?**
  
[/font][/b][/size][/font]

  
* [font=Verdana][font=Verdana][size=3]Yes. There are a number of female NPCs covered by the mod and I will only continue to expand the list.[/font][/size][/font]

[font=Verdana]**Will the dialogue be available if I am playing as a male PC?**
  
[/font]

  
* [font=Verdana]All the [/font][font=Verdana]dialogue will be available for male PCs but some male NPCs will speak to [/font][font=Verdana]you as if you are female. All female NPCs' dialogue on the other hand [/font][font=Verdana]are more sex-neutral and won't speak to you specifically as if you are a [/font][font=Verdana]male or female.[/font]
    
  [font=Verdana]
    
  [/font][font=Verdana] [/font]

[font=Verdana]**What if I only want to see female lover dialogue or only male lover dialogue?**[/font]

  
* [font=Verdana]As of Version 1.1, an MCM is now available to enable/disable lover dialogue for each NPC.[/font]
    
  [font=Verdana]
    
  [/font]

[font=Verdana]**Is this compatible with Amorous Adventures or other romance dialogue mods?**[/font][font=Verdana]
  
[/font]

  
* [font=Verdana]See note on compatibility in the main page. It is compatible in the sense that you can use this mod alongside those [/font][font=Verdana]mods perfectly fine and nothing will break. However, there's going to be [/font][font=Verdana]some overlap in dialogue that you may not like. For example, OStim [/font][font=Verdana]Lovers and AA both cover Idgrod the Younger. The lover dialogue for OStim [/font][font=Verdana]Lovers AND the lover dialogue from AA are both going to be available for [/font][font=Verdana]her. As of Version 1.1, an MCM is now available to enable/disable lover [/font][font=Verdana]dialogue for each NPC which could resolve some of this dialogue  [/font][font=Verdana]incongruity with other mods.[/font]
    
  [font=Verdana]
    
  [/font]

[font=Verdana]**Will you cover X NPC?**[/font]

  
* [font=Verdana]I plan to cover a lot more NPCs and I have a list of 50+ NPCs I intend to [/font][font=Verdana]finish writing (see Articles tab). Finishing that list is my priority for this [/font][font=Verdana]mod currently. The updates may be slow though as I'm pretty busy with  [/font][font=Verdana]life in general.[/font]
