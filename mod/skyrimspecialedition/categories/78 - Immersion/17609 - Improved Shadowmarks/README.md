This mod adds Thieves Guild shadowmarks to player homes and improves the appearance of the existing shadowmarks. Now you can inform fellow thieves of your status in the Guild, while simultaneously protecting your house and property from any unwanted visitors. This mod has no practical effect on gameplay or any other function in the game. It is solely a cosmetic change for roleplaying purposes.

[font=Georgia][size=6]INSTALLATION[/size][/font]
  
Download and install one of the main file options using your preferred mod manager, or manually extract the .zip file to the Skyrim Special Edition/Data folder.
  
  
**Texture Only Options:** There is also the option to install only the new textures, without any of the other changes. These have been provided as loose files, and as such it's recommended that you install them using a mod manager.
  
  
[font=Georgia]ADDITIONAL [size=6]INFORMATION[/size][/font]
  
Shadowmarks on player homes will automatically adjust depending on the ownership status of the home and the player's status with the Thieve Guild.
  

  
* Unowned homes will have the **Empty** mark
Homes owned by non-guild members or banned members will have the **Danger** mark
  
* Homes owned by members of Thieves Guild members will have a **Guild** mark.
The three buildable Hearthfire homes and Severin Manor will also receive a **Guild** mark if appropriate, but they won't receive any of the other marks if they are unowned or if the player is not a member of the Thieves Guild.
  

  
If you wish to use the **Loot** shadowmark for non-member player homes instead of the **Danger** mark, then open the console and enter:
  
Set TGRShadowmark\_UseLootMark to 1
  
Shadowmarks will be updated the next time the cell is loaded.
