During the quest "Taste of Death", you will encounter a cave full of cannibals feasting on recent kills. The issue is that said cannibals eat... bread. This mod uses AnimObjectSwapper to dynamically swap the bread used to a slab of meat while inside that cave. It's really that simple, but boost immersion tremendously.
