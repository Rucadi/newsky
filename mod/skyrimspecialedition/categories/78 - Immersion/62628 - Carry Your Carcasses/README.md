[font=Georgia]A HUNTING COMPANION MOD[/font]**

  
I would like to start with a huge thank you to [slavicpotato1](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5217635)'s[Immersive Equipment Displays](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62001). Just incredible!! Because of their contribution to the community, I was finally able to make this mod completely script free. Which is great because that kind of thing is WAY above my pay grade. I am a HUGE fan of [Hunterborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7900) ﻿but it did always bother me that I was carrying a 300 pound animal in my shoe. So taking inspiration from Red Dead Redemption, I got to work.
  
  

[font=Georgia][size=5]**GOOD NEWS, EVERYONE!!**

[/font]
  
I am excited to announce that I have partnered with [JaySerpa](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5201727) on their brand spankin' new [Simple Hunting Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/95943). This means a shiny new main file and more than one way to enjoy CYC!! Because the meshes will be the same, the Fluffworks patch and its future updates will also be compatible. I would like to give a shout out to [Xynerorias](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/6546516) for taking the time to work through IED and adjusting the creatures as needed.

(Works with BOTH Simple Hunting Overhaul and Hunterborn)

  
  
[/size]**WHAT THIS MOD DOES**
  

  
* Adds animal carcasses to your person when they're in your inventory.
Supported carcasses *(because carrying a Cave Bear is stupid... much better to put them in your bag of holding)*:
  

 ﻿﻿﻿﻿- Chicken *<-- delicious*
  
 ﻿﻿- Deer
  
 ﻿﻿- Dog
  
 ﻿﻿- Elk Female
  
 ﻿﻿- Elk Male
  
 ﻿﻿- Fox
  
 ﻿- Giant Mudcrab
  
 ﻿﻿﻿- Goat
  
 ﻿﻿- Hare
  
 ﻿﻿- Ice Wolf
  
 ﻿- Large Mudcrab
  
 ﻿﻿- Mudcrab
  
 ﻿- Skeever
  
 - Slaughterfish
  
 ﻿ ﻿﻿﻿﻿- Snow Fox
  
 - Vale Deer *<-- never had it before*
  
﻿ ﻿ ﻿- Wolf
  

  
* [size=3]Unsupported carcasses
  
 ﻿ ﻿- Bear
  
 ﻿ ﻿- Bristleback
  
 ﻿ ﻿- Cave Bear
  
 ﻿ ﻿- Cow
  
 ﻿ ﻿- Horker
  
 ﻿ ﻿- Horse
  
 ﻿ ﻿- Mammoth
  
 ﻿ ﻿- Sabre Cat
  
 ﻿ ﻿- Snow Bear
  
 ﻿ ﻿- Snowy Saber Cat
  
 ﻿ ﻿- Vale Sabre Cat
  

  
* Uses your custom textures so long as they overwrite vanilla. *(except for the hare carcass but those textures have been provided, courtesy of [Real Rabbits HD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29223)﻿. Vanilla textures won't fit the mesh I use. I can make a vanilla patch if there is interest.)*
Updates inventory items to look like the carcass you're carrying *(except for the larger animals)*.
  
* All carcasses can be displayed on the backs of horses if you have the proper horse mods to use it.

  
* All presets are set to be disabled if the Actor isn't wearing any pieces of armor or clothing. Ya know. For bathing. And, um... *\*clears throat\**
There is a version of the preset that adds the goat hide model to your back whenever you are carrying animal pelts or hides. This preset includes ALL animal pelts and hides, even the big'ens.
  

[/size]
  
  
  
**WHAT THIS MOD DOES NOT DO**
  

  
* ~~Support shelled meshes for more realistic fur. These meshes were hand manipulated using vanilla assets. You can play with them together, the look just won't be the same. Maybe you shaved them.~~

 ﻿ ﻿- ~~patch for [Fluffworks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56361) coming soon~~ **<-- DONE!! See optional files**
  

  
* Add **more** animal carcasses, so no red wolves or monsters. What Hunterborn and Simple Hunting Overhaul gots is what ya has.

  
* Change the textures of your animals. *(mods used in the screenshots are at the bottom of the page. support them. download it. synergy.)*

  
* Help you with the math test you didn't study for.

  
  

﻿﻿﻿**ABOUT OPTIONAL FILE FOR VALE DEER**

This was not originally supposed to be included with the mod but, as I was working with the Vale Deer mesh, I realized there was very little love put into it by the developers. Like an overcooked steak... or Steven Seagal movies. There were a lot of texture gaps in the vanilla mesh so I decided to fix them for both this mod and in the game. I wasn't able to find any mods that fixed these things on Nexus or even had any sort of retexture, so I decided to include my retexture and ﻿mesh improvement for those who are interested. Examples of these changes are in the screenshots. It wants to be pretty! Let it be pretty!!

  
  
  
**﻿ABOUT CARCASSES ON HORSES**

  
* [size=3]A mod that allows you to access your horse's inventory is REQUIRED to use this option. [Immersive Horses](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13402)﻿ is an example of such a mod. [Convenient Horses](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9519)﻿ does not directly access a horse's inventory and so is not compatible. Use [Quick Inventory](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47165) as a work around. Also allows you to add carcasses to a follower’s horses.
  
Meshes and IED presets are designed to fit vanilla horses but fit most modded horse models. Verified compatibility for [Oblivion Horses](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32335)﻿ and [SC - Horses](https://www.patreon.com/posts/sc-horses-35289631)﻿.
  
- Meshes and IED presets were designed around vanilla saddles. May need to adjust placement if using modded saddles or horse armor. Or not. Carcasses are your armor now!
Most of the carcasses other than chicken, hare, and slaughterfish are good with biscuits... I mean stored on the back! So storing multiple carcasses on a horse will result in clipping. So, ya know… maybe don't do that.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
[/size]**KNOWN ISSUES/CONCERNS**
  

  
* I use [True Wolves Of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59174) by [KrittaKitty](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/4930906) in my playthroughs so her meshes were used for the wolves. It's not that noticeable of a difference when the model is on your shoulder, but just thought you should know. The meshes also just use vanilla textures, so… boom. Compatibility.
Clipping... just gonna leave this here.
  
* Did my best with the sizes of the back models and the models in the game. They are a little smaller but look better, at least in my opinion. Feel free to adjust as you see fit.
Carrying multiple carcasses at once can get weird with bigger animals. As I was designing where to put the animals, I kept in mind that smaller animals can be carried at once. And, honestly, I have never found myself carrying an elk and deer at the same time. But if you're curious what that might look like, see the screenshots section.
