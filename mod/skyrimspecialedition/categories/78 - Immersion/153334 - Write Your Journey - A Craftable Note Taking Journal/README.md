?️ Write Your Journey – A Craftable Note Taking Journal**﻿

  
This mod adds a **craftable, writable journal** to Skyrim, designed for use with the [**Dynamic Book Framework**.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/152364)
  
Inspired by the classic *[Take Notes - Journal of the Dragonborn SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13570)*, this mod offers a **vanilla, lore-friendly, and immersive** alternative for players who love in-game journaling.
  
  
**? Features:**
  

  
* Adds a **vanilla-style blank journal** you can write in.
Craftable at a **tanning rack** with:
  
> * 3 × Roll of Paper
> 1 × Inkwell
>   
> * 1 × Quill

Also **purchasable** from the **Riverwood Trader** for convenience.
  
* No scripts, quests, or extra assets – just a simple book ready for use.

  
**⚙️ How It Works:**
  
This mod does **not** provide the writing functionality itself. All note-taking, text editing, and dynamic features come from the **Dynamic Book Framework (DBF)**, which is required.
  
The DBF already includes a blank journal by default, but it **will be removing the journal in a future update** to focus solely on the back-end framework. This mod exists to offer a **separate, standalone version**.
  
  

  
* > **Reminder: Press F10 after installing DBF to open the menu.﻿**

**? Requirements:**
  

  
* **✅ [Dynamic Book Framework](YOUR_LINK_HERE)** (required for functionality)

  
**? Why Use This?**
  
If you want a clean, lore-friendly, standalone journal you can craft or buy, this mod gives you exactly that — while keeping DBF functionality modular and future-proof.
