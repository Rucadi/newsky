![](https://i.imgur.com/PwJxVUw.png)[/font][/left][left][font=Times New Roman]*With this mod you can encounter on the northern shores of Skyrim the skeletons of whales that died stranded on the coast, or washed ashore after dying in the ocean.
  
  
It is possible to find skeletons of whales of different sizes, including mothers with their calves, who died together stranded without being able to return to the ocean. Some of these gargantuan skeletons are home to wild predators, mudcrabs, and even bandits and fishermen.*

(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Shards of Immersion saga brings small elements that add a touch of immersion and realism to the fantastic world of Skyrim, making it even more alive and dynamic, which seems to exist beyond the adventure of the Dragonborn.

Author: Mihail- The models used in this mod are derived from Sovngarde's vanilla bridge made from the skeleton of a gigantic whale, but modified to have the shape of an ordinary whale, without the gadgets and modifications made by the people of this divine realm on the one used as their bridge. Also the parts have been divided into pieces in this mod to be distributed separately. Textures initially at 1024x1024 resolution are now at 4k. Model collisions were generated especially for these models, not using the original ones, for better immersion and experience. Sovngarde's vanilla bridge remains unaffected by this mod.
