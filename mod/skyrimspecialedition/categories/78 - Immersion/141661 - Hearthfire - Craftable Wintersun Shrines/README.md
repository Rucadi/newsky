**Why this mod exists?**
  
It always bummed me out that you could build only the shrines of the Divines. What about the rest of Wintersun deities?
  
And who needs a whole NINE shrines when you can follow only one? Not right. So I made this mod!
  
  
**What does this mod do?**
  
It makes the shrine base smaller and places it in the middle of cellar along the wall (see screenshots).
  
  
It adds recipes so you can craft shrines of **all 51 deities** that you can follow in Wintersun. Note that you can only build one shrine in one home, so choose wisely!
  
  
To craft a shrine, first craft the Shrine Base at Carpenter's Workbench, and then you'll see all the recipes there.
