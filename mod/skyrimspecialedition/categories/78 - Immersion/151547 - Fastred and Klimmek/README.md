I hate Bassianus.
  
  
The man is living rent-free in Klimmek's house, and instead of repaying Klimmek by trying to make himself useful or earn money, Bassianus spends his time sneering and trash-talking his host, and sweet-talking his girlfriend. His only ambition is to move to Riften, where he'll presumably be joining the Thieves' Guild and sleazing up to Sapphire pretty soon. I hope she cuts his tackle off.
  
  
And yet - it seems like that's the option you're supposed to pick in 'The Book of Love'. If you match Fastred with Bassianus, she dashes off to Riften to spend her time mooning around after him. (Where, incidentally, he still does nothing useful.) But if you pair her with Klimmek - nothing changes. She continues to live with her parents, who continue to treat her like a child. And worst of all, Klimmek continues trying to chat up Lynly Star-Sung. It's as if the relationship fizzled the moment you turned your back.
  
  
This mod changes that. Now, if you persuade Klimmek to approach Fastred, next time you visit, you may observe the following changes:
  

  
1. Fastred still lives with her parents and works on their farm during the day, but now they give her some space - no more "pitch in a little more" or "it stops now".
In the evening, she stops work and joins Klimmek for dinner, before enjoying a few hours of quality time around the village with him. She may even help him out in his side hustle digging clay.
  
2. Klimmek no longer tries to get a date with Lynly.

  
That's all it does. No new dialogue is added, no player quests altered. Changes are only made to the "postquest" for 'The Book of Love' (which affects only Bassianus and Fastred, and now also Klimmek), and the triggers for the scenes mentioned above.
  
**Q&A**
  
Q: Light plugin?
  
A: Of course.
  
  
Q: Why doesn't she move in with him?
  
A: She's still very young. There's no real clear indication of her age, but both her parents talk to her - and she talks - like she's still, at most, mid-teens. Plenty of time for that.
  
  
(In terms of mod mechanics: that would require more extensive changes, including editing the interior of Klimmek's house. That would create many more potential compatibility issues, and I don't want to have to deal with those.)
  
  
Q: But Bassianus is the one she's in love with! Why are you so against him?
  
A: See above. When Jofthor talks about "throwing her to the wolves", he's talking about Bassianus - and he's right. The man makes Mikael look like a bastion of integrity.
  
  
Q: I disagree with you, I'm gonna pick Bassianus anyway!
  
A: Your game, your choice. In that case this mod will have almost no effect - the lovers will head off to Riften together, where both of them will do precisely nothing *(and I presume Bassianus will abandon her, probably pregnant, in a few months, but if that does happen it's nothing to do with this mod)*. The only thing that will change is, you won't hear Fastred's parents arguing about her future any more.
  
  
Q: Compatible with...?
  
A: I'm not aware of any mod this would create a conflict with, but if you find one please do let me know. I have not touched the characters or locations, nor any player quests or scripts.
  
  
Q: Can I install mid-save? Uninstall?
  
A: If you have already completed this quest, then you won't get the full effect from retro-fitting the mod. It will suppress the scenes between Fastred and her parents, and Klimmek and Lynly, but you won't see any ongoing interaction between Fastred and Klimmek. For that to happen, it has to be installed before you get as far as talking to the chosen suitor.
  
  
If you uninstall the mod after it's been activated - I don't know for sure what will happen, but my guess would be nothing. There's no scripts or anything like that to mess up, so the game will probably revert to vanilla behaviour.
