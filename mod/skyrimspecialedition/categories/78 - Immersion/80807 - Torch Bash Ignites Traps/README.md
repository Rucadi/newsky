[line]
  
Have you ever played a pure non-magickal role playthrough? You surely felt the pain of being unable to trigger oil pools without a bow or igniting the Summerset Shadow's banner without using Flames even though you have a perfectly fine torch!
  
  
This mod allows torch bashing (AKA pressing attack while blocking with a torch) to ignite traps like oil pools, gas traps or Goldenglow Estate beehives.
  
It will also trigger other environmental traps like tripwires or elemental runes.
  
  
 *﻿Be advised that triggering such traps with a torch is still an unhealthy habit.*

Bashing with a torch will:
  
  

  
* ignite oil pools.
ignite gas traps.
  
* ignite Goldenglow Estate beehives.
ignite Summerset Shadow banner.
  
* trigger oil spider explosion.
ignite oil spider (explosive) trail.
  
* trigger tripwires.
trigger elemental runes.
  
* *(Unintended)* triggering the secret room in Winterhold's College quest - Under Saarthal.

  
 *﻿In short, if a fireball triggers it, torch bashing is highly likely to do so.*

Mod doesn't edit any master records, so it *should* be compatible with any mod.
