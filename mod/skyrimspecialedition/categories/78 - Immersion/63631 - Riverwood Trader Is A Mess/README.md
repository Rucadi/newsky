**Description**
  
  
At the start of the [Golden Claw](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Golden_Claw) quest, [Lucan Valerius](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Lucan_Valerius) mentions "I better get back to cleaning the store. What a mess." but in Vanilla I failed to see any mess in his shop.
  
  
So, I decided to turn it into an actual mess. In addition, if you ask him if something happened, another option will show which will allow you to help him cleaning up. (which takes 6 in game hours). After that's done, you'll receive a small amount of gold and a random item as a reward.
  
  
If you don't help him clean up, it will be cleaned up automatically after you finish the Golden Claw quest.
  
  
There's an optional file that places the Golden Claw out of common sight, so the thieves making a mess would make more sense, as they couldn't just take the Golden Claw and leave. The slide door is an expert lock, but can also be opened by the cabinet key that both Lucan and Camilla have. This file is incompatible with any mods that edit the Riverwood Trader.
  
  
**Customization**
  
  
You can change the time that will pass when cleaning:
  
  

```
set ANDR_RTIAM_GLOB_TimeToPass to X
```

  
  
X is the amount of hours, that will pass while helping Lucan/Camilla cleaning up the store. (Default value is 6.)

**FAQ**
  
  
Q: What's the point of this?
  
A: "Fer uhmershun!" In all seriousness, I made this mod as a request. If it's not your cup of tea, that's okay. This mod isn't for everyone. Just move along silently.
  
  
Q: ESPFE?
  
A: Yes.
  
  
Q: Does installing/updating/uninstalling on an existing save work?
  
A: As far as I know, it should. However, it's good practice to keep a backup save prior to doing this, just in case.
  
  
Q: Is this compatible with <insert mod>?
  
A: I don't know by heart. You might need to check yourself.
  
  
Q: Will you make a patch for <insert mod>?
  
A: Only if it's a mod I use myself or plan on using, I have enough time and I actually like the idea. Otherwise, feel free to do it yourself. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: I have a suggestion to improve the mod. Can you do it?
  
A: Maybe, if I have time and I like the idea, I'll consider it.
  
  
Q: Will you port this to <insert platform>?
  
A: No, I myself only support the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If someone else wants to port it, feel free. (see permission) If you decide to port it, you yourself take full responsibility to offer support to said port. I will not provide no support for any ports by third parties.
  
  
Q: I use a ported version of this mod on <insert platform> and I have a problem. Can you help?
  
A: I don't provide any support for third party ports on other platforms than the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If you have issues, you should adress the person that ported it.
  
  
Q: Does this work on Skyrim 1.6+, aka "Anniversary Edition"?
  
A: Yes, it should.
  
  
Q: Why don't your mods use MCMs and instead use this janky console command system to set globals?
  
A: I am not a fan of MCMs. You can set the globals by making a patch in xEdit. I have no plans of changing this. If you want to add an MCM, feel free. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: Why don't you use FOMODs?
  
A: That would require reuploading the entire mod, in question, even if I only make a small change. My internet is limited and reuploading the files each time will take a huge chunk of my monthly volume.
