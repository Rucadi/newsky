[font=Comic Sans MS]***We use [Immersive Laundry](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2011) and we think this is a mod that is not to be missed in a modlist. But the laundry is not animated and just static. So we created an add-on to have them animated by tweaking the meshes from [Immersive Laundry Wood Post Re-texture](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73149) and using [Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805) to swap the static meshes to animated ones.
  
  
Important note: The meshes do not have collision for obvious reasons. Interfering with NPC's navmeshes so they won't get stuck!
