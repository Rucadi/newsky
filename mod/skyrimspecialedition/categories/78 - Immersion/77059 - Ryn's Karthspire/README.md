[font=Georgia]My Goal[/font]
  
  
[font=Georgia]I love The Elder Scrolls series dearly, and I want to make my favorite game feel better for everyone. 
  
There are many other modders who do amazing things, and I feel like as a group we can make Skyrim feel new in EVERY way. 
  
My goal is to update, tweak, or entirely change most of the game's exteriors of commonly visited locations and dungeons throughout Skyrim, marked as ESL when available.
  
The scope of this project is massive, as I plan to redesign the experience you will have playing Skyrim. Whether you're a longtime veteran, or a totally new player, you will have something new, exciting, and more enjoyable to explore.

[font=Georgia]Ryn's Skyrim
  
  
An ongoing project to overhaul the entirety of Skyrim's Worldspace. This will initially released in individual files, then as large AOI files, then finally in the end I will provide an all encompassing AOI file that will contain everything.
  
This will inherently make the game **more** **difficult**, as additional enemy spawns will be placed to match the increased size of most locations. And certain enemies will be changed to be a bit more difficult. As well as totally new boss enemies being introduced.
  
The largest and most well known mods in the community will always be taken into consideration as I attempt to create a product that is either easily patched, or does not require a patch. However, I will not limit my creativity to accommodate other mods. I will only try to make it as easily patched as I can while completing my vision.
  
  
I have full plans to create **open world bosses**, as well as bosses with their own **dungeons** or **worldspaces**. These bosses will massively range in difficulty, but know that open world bosses that you can easily wander into will never be on the most difficult side of the scale.
  
Bosses will potentially come with unique weapons, armors, or spells, as reward for defeating them.
  
These rewards will either be made by me, or be provided by other skilled Mod Authors.
  
  
Additional locations, are part of Ryn's Skyrim as well. New points of interest, new openworld dwellings, new dungeons and worldspaces.
  
The scope of this mod is***massive***, and will take time to be completed. 
  
  
While completing this project, I will be releasing individual locations as I finish them so that the community can enjoy them. I will try my best to provide patches for other mods that are not created by me, though only the most "important" ones will I patch. When this project is complete, I will focus heavily on patches like that, *as to work with my end product* "**Ryn's Skyrim**".
  
Until then, I will be releasing patches that allow my own individual files to work seamlessly.
  
This project aims to redesign most of Skyrim and change your entire experience. So creating patches for tons of mods as I go will only slow the process. 
  
  
**Ryn's Skyrim** individual locations are meant to work on their own, so you can choose which you like and would like to stay away from. But in the end, all locations are meant to work together. Some locations will need patches that are necessary because of this. I will provide these patches.
  
These patches will not only include fixes to allow these files to work together, but will sometimes include interactions between the two original files. Small things usually.

MOD AUTHORS
  
I am always looking for others to work with. If you would like to help with this project, please contact me on the Nexus or on Discord. I am available in both places very often. Though mostly Discord. You will almost always get a reply from me on Discord within minutes.
  
  
I'm searching for **creators** to contribute assets such as **armors** and **weapons**. This includes already created mods you may wish the be included in some way in this project. I will ALWAYS provide clear and upfront credits to those who contribute. 
  
**Level Designers** that may want to join, I am not so interested in. If you feel so compelled though, again, feel free to contact me on the Nexus or on Discord.
  
  
 Ryn's Karthspire
  
***One of my most in-depth overhauls yet.***
  
 A pivotal location in the main story of Skyrim, Karthspire is meant to be difficult, and exciting.
  
Generally speaking, it is only sometimes more difficult than the average dungeon exterior. The enemies there in vanilla are nearly all defined as "aggro-range" enemies. Meaning just about every single one of them will watch you kill their buddies from 30 feet away, until you fight them next. This leads to weird situations where the player has little trouble defeating the already over-average amount of enemies in the area, while those enemies are stopped in totally random spots, seemingly waiting their turn to die.
  
I saw what Bethesda was trying to make when I really thought about why the enemies were chosen to be this way, and I expanded on it ***BIG TIME.***
  
Still, about half of the enemies will hold their positions. But now, they hold their positions in much more tactically-advantageous areas. Melee forsworn will be "aggro-range" enemies who will be waiting for you to cross into their threshold, while archers in other high-up areas will pelt you with arrows while you make your way across the many bridges, and through the lower alleyways.
  
  
Hagraven Matron
  
The Hagraven who normally spawns in this location has been replaced with another, unique Hagraven.
  
Now a uniquely named boss (who will hold a unique weapon in the short future), The Hagraven Matron is in terms of stats, is fairly buffed from its vanilla counterparts. It is not a tank by any means, although it does have a buff in HP, and some new defensive spells.
  
Instead, its newly added perks allow it to hit *much harder* than its vanilla underlings.
  
  
  
Structural Changes
  
Karthspire offered a fantastic opportunity to use some of the least-used assets in the entire game. The building blocks of Sky Haven Temple.
  
Karthspire is now an extremely unique location with its own personality that sets it apart from every single other location I have updated, boasting not only a very distinct architecture, but a unique design in how you navigate the location. Skyrim lacks verticality in its dungeons and worldspaces, and it lacks depth. Ryn's Karthspire feels both true-to-vanilla, and so very excitingly new in this way. I feel this is some of my best to-date examples of what Vanilla+ means in my project.
  
  
Performance
  
Karthspire received not only an overhaul of its original footprint, but a huge increase in the size of said footprint. The location is roughly 3x the detail of the original location, and 2x the size. With increases like this, it's reasonable to expect a performance hit. 
  
However, given the design of the location now with its vertical nature, occlusion cubes and planes were able to be used extensively.
  
In vanilla testing, not once did I drop below***58.5 FPS*.** In modded testing, frames stayed more stable while in the location, than areas surrounding it. Typically in my modded performance-test-profile, 45-55 FPS can be expected in the surrounding area. Inside of Ryn's Karthspire, I averaged *53 FPS.* Remember that you can expect different outcomes based on your setup.
  
  
  
FAQ[/font]

[font=Georgia]
  
  
**Will you make a patch for \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?:**
  
Maybe. If you are going to ask, please ask nicely. I'm a human before I am a modder. :)
  
I focus heavily on creating new mods to add to this project, so creating patches for other mods is not on the top of my list, unless it is among the most important to have patched. If you would like niche mods to be patched, I'm sorry but you may have to seek other assistance. This project will take a very very long time as it is.
  
**If you put PATCH REQUESTS in the bug section, I will consider banning you from viewing any of my content.**
  
**I don't like this./This enemy is too hard. Can you change it for me?:**
  
Damn that's crazy.
  
  
**How do I contact you about \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?:**
  
You can message me here on the nexus, or message me on Discord. (At the bottom of this page)
  
  
**I'm having *insert bug* issue. Can you help?:**
  
Please put any issues in the bug section. They are far more likely to be taken care of that way. I see your comments. I read all of them. Seriously, I read every single comment. Adding your patch requests in the BUG section will make me considerably less likely to make the patch. 
  
**Please when reporting a bug, include images if you can. Chances are I will ask you for images regardless. Please either embed these images, or provide a link to Imgur. I will not go to any other site to view your images. If you provide a link to any other site, I will probably just delete or ignore the comment or bug report.** 
  
I **HIGHLY**suggest using a mod like [More Informative Console](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19250?tab=description) to help you pinpoint where bugs are coming from and provide that information to the correct author.
  
  
**Can you make an AIO version containing all of your mods?**
  
Not yet. 
  
That is planned for later on and will come when I have the final creation of Ryn's Skyrim. Until then, no.
  
**Can you overhaul *insert location*?**It's probably already on my list, but please feel free to request. Sometimes that's what pushes me to work on it.
  
  
**Why don't you make many patches for other mods to work with your mods?**
  
Because this project is very big. Making patches for other mods will take up an incredible amount of my time and drain me of any interest I have in completing this project. I am choosing to work on my own goal first, and then later I will pay much more attention to creating patches for other authors' work.
