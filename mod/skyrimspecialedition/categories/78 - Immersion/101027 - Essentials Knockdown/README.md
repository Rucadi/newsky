﻿﻿**Essentials Knockdown**

Essential NPCs will not kneel on knockdown, instead they will ragdoll and fell unconscious to the floor. This is a SPID version of [Essentials Ragdoll on Knockdown](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24974) and a simpler version of [Andrealphus' Bleedout Revamp](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49240) that only contains the ragdoll on knockdown.
