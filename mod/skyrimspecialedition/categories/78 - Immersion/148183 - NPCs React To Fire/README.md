# NPCs React To Fire

There are voice lines in the game for when NPCs are set on fire — **but** you could only hear them if you had the vanilla perk *Intense Flames*.
  
**If** you were using a perk overhaul, chances are you couldn’t hear them at all!
  
  
This mod fixes that. Now, NPCs will react to being set on fire regardless of what perks you have**.**
  
  
In addition to restoring these potentially unused lines, this mod adds over **50 new voice lines**, created by repurposing or carefully splicing existing vanilla audio.
  
  
**Mod is script free and even works with mod added spells**! 
  
(as long as they have "MagicDamageFire" keyword.) 
  
**Compatible with everything !** 
  
(no vanilla edits.)
  
  
**Safe to install/remove midgame.
  
  
Performance?**
  
(Only activates when "applymagiceffect" event occurs,
  
no performance impact.) 
  
  
**Things to Note:** 
  
Only works for npcs that are one of the 45 default vanilla voice types.
