# Thane's Privilege - Guards Forgive You Multiple Times

By default, Thane's privilege can only be used once and the bounty must be under 2000 gold, which is a limitation. This mod allows you to change the number of times the privilege can be used and the maximum bounty amount that the privilege can handle according to your preferences.
  
  
The configurations include:
  
  

  
* [size=3]**Max bounty Can Handle ( Gold )**: Determine the maximum bounty your Thane privilege can handle.
If you choose '0', it means you can use the Thane privilege regardless of the bounty amount.
  
[/size]
  

  
* **Cooldown Time To Use Again ( Days )**: Determine the number of days needed before you can use your Thane privilege to avoid arrest again. If you choose '0', it means you can use it with no day limit

  
Here is an example that I use in my game:
  
  
 *﻿Max bounty Can Handle: 500 Gold
  
 ﻿Cooldown Time To Use Again : 0 Days*
  
  
This allows me to use my privilege an unlimited number of times as long as the bounty is under 500 gold.
  
  
Requirement
  
  
SkyUI  -  For MCM, of course.
  
  
  
Installing
  
  
Safe to install mid game,  usual modmanager installation
  
  
**Important note for those who install the mod mid-game and have already used Thane's privilege before:***When you use Thane's privilege, it is locked immediately by default. To allow the mod to function, you'll need to unlock it again. Simply after installing the mod, go to the MCM configuration page for this mod, wait for all the configurations to load (then you can adjust them as you like or leave them at default), and exit MCM. Save your game, and you're done.*
  
  
  
Compatibility
  
  
This mod is compatible with everything except mods that affect the use of Thane's privilege to escape bounties or change the factions of the player and guards.
  
  
  
FAQ
  
  
ESP-FE?
  
Of course.
  
  
I changed the 'Cooldown Time To Use Again,' but it doesn't seem to be applied.
  
This is related to how this mod works. After you use Thane's privilege, a timer starts counting down for the next use. If, for example, the previous setting was 7 days and you use your privilege, then go into MCM and change it to 3 days, it doesn't mean you can use the privilege after 3 days. You still have to wait the full 7 days from your previous use before you can use it again. After that, the next use will then follow the new 3-day setting.
  
For the maximum bounty, it will be applied immediately.
