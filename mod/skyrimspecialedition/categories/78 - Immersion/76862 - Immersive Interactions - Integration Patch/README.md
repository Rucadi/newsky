The amazing mod [Immersive Interactions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47670)(II-AA for short) from JaySerpa provides numerous animated interactions to various activities, two of them are: the "Loot animals" and "Loot NPCs".
  
  
The mod has in-built compatibility with [Hunterborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17993), but only in the "Loot animals" part of the mod. However, it does not work quite well for Dragons and Spriggans, which can be considered game with "Monster Hunter" option of Hunterborn, because they are considered as NPCs in II-AA, and when both mods are enabled, the NPC looting animation plays at the same time as Hunterborn loot prompt.
  
  
The situation above can also happens when a mod adds a different approach to looting (or maybe other sort of interaction covered by II-AA).
  
  
The main file aims to add compatibility between those mods, by making changes to the script responsible for the looting animations of II-AA.
  
**Currently, the mods covered by this patch are:**
  

  
* [Hunterborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17993): Hunting prompt action.
[The Dark Arts](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29834): Dissection prompt while sneaking.
  
* [Better Vampires](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1925): Corpse feeding and Blood extract prompts while sneaking.
[Dynamic Things Alternative - Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60741): Interactions with wood piles, mead and blood barrels/caskets and hay piles.
  
* [Diverse Firewood - Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/100870): Interactions with wood piles.
[Survival Mode](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Survival_Mode)﻿ or [Survival Mode Improved](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78244): Praying animation at shrines will work properly with the offering gold option.
  
* [Wintersun](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506)﻿: Wintersun has its own animations for praying at a shrines; you should disable the praying animations in Immersive Interactions MCM.
[Favor Jobs Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40145)﻿(FJO): Compatibility with the "working at a farm". When installing FJO, choose the compatibility patch for II-AA and then let the scripts from this page win the conflict.
  
* [Extensible Follower Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7003): Support for the wheel menu and follower interactions.
[Just Knock - Reversed Version](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/103004): Support for knocking features.
  
* [Synergy - Skills and Perks Reimagined](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72352): Can only harvest flora and critter with the appropriate perks.

  
You can use the patch even if you don't have one of the mods above installed, as it will look for the mods using some script functions that allow this.
  
P.S: If you are using the old version of this patch and only uses Hunterborn, you don't need to update.
  
  
Requests are open if know of a mod that does something similar, provided that I can find a ~~relatively easy~~ way to implement it.
