I wanted to add an immersive detail when the player changes from beast form back to human, with a genuine animation and a version of the werewolf/werebear transition effect that's playing backwards, as if the fur is either retracting back into the skin or perhaps falling off. Even comes with it's own sound effect.

-[Moonlight Tales](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35470) (Needs to be manually ported for SSE. And if you have [Moonlight Tales Essentials](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59463), you will need to disable that mod's "Transform stagger animation" in the mod configuration menu, otherwise the stagger animation will overwrite this mod's animation. (Thanks to user Kourtana for pointing that out))
  
  
-[Moonlight Tales Special Edition](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2803) (In MTSE you need to disable the Transform Back Animation/Transform Back Stagger options in the [MCM](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17363))

**Note:** I haven't been able to proof-test every version besides MTSE and Growl, mostly because I don't feel like replacing a werewolf gameplay overhaul mid-game. **Another note:** If you run into any conflicts or have some constructive critique to offer, feel free to shoot me a PM, I rarely read the comment sections of my mods anymore.
  
  
**Installation:**
  
Download and install with a mod manager of your choice, or you can manually download the archive and then drag-and-drop into the mod tab of Vortex and customize the installation.
