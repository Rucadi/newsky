![](https://i.imgur.com/PwJxVUw.png)[/font][/left][left][font=Times New Roman]Certainly an unforgettable sighting, the gargantuan remains of the ancient Atmorans are a fragment of a forgotten past of fearless warrior giants who towered above the mountains and who conquered Skyrim long before the arrival of Ysgramor and his Companions. The remains can mostly be found on the snowy mountains of northern Skyrim.

It is known that there were several waves of Atmoran immigration, and that even in Atmora these humanoids existed in different sizes, from the size of a Nord, to larger than a mountain. 
  
For this mod, as inspiration, I used two paintings representing ancient Atmorans/Giants, with my skeletal remains being an intermediate size between them:

(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Shards of Immersion saga brings small elements that add a touch of immersion and realism to the fantastic world of Skyrim, making it even more alive and dynamic, which seems to exist beyond the adventure of the Dragonborn.
