The **TitKit** configuration for the Overlay Distribution Framework (ODF) applies a variety of immersive areola and nipple overlays to female NPCs across Skyrim. This setup is designed to enhance visual diversity in a nuanced way, offering tone-matched overlays for both light- and dark-skinned characters.
  
  
The configuration includes a wide selection of texture styles—from soft rings and speckled patterns to more defined areola shapes—all applied with carefully tuned tints and transparency levels to ensure a natural appearance across different skin tones. Distribution is handled based on racial categorization:
  

  
* **Light-skinned races** (e.g., Breton, Nord, Imperial, High Elf) receive overlays from three curated collections with varying pigmentation and style.
**Darker-skinned races** (e.g., Redguard, Orc, Dark Elf, Wood Elf) are limited to two compatible overlay sets to improve natural blending with the underlying skin. It's not quite perfect, but still fun!
  

  
The collections include neutral pigmentation, more pink pigmentation, and the classic dark pigmentation that the suggested RaceMenu settings in the TitKit mod provide. Overall distribution is set at 30%.
  
  
In addition to general distribution, a separate download set targets **bandit faction members**, offering a 15% independent chance to receive a bold “x-tape” style overlay, soft or hard ring overlay, or duct tape overlay. This effect can appear alongside standard areola textures, adding visual distinction for these rougher NPCs without disrupting core immersion.
  
  
The TitKit configuration avoids application to beast races.
