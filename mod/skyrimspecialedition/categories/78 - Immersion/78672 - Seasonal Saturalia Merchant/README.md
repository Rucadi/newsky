**Seasonal Saturalia Merchant**

  
**Features:**
  
 ﻿- Will disable the merchant during spring, summer and autumn months

**Seasons of Skyrim version**

  
Utilises the papyrus functions included in Seasons of Skyrim to use its winter setting to determine when the merchant spawns, this means that the spawns will coincide with winter even if using a mod that alters how the months and seasons progress.

The merchant will be available during Evening Star, Morning Star and Sun's Dawn.
