> Matriarch, we await your orders. Our blades are honed, our quivers full, our wills steeled for battle. The time of our waiting has ended. The time for battle is at hand. You have but to speak the word, and the occupiers shall fall like wheat before the reaper.

The Matriarch of the Forsworn is mentioned only twice in the game, and only through hidden Forsworn notes. Her control over the faction looms over much of the Reach, and her battle with the player at Hag's End is memorable, however her appearance lacks some distinction.
  
  
This mod changes that, renaming her "The Matriarch" and replacing her model with one more befitting of the Forsworn's hidden monarch. She's now clad in animal bones, a hooded mask fashioned from a Spriggan Earth Mother, and (as of v1.1) optional white feathers.
  
  
I recommend playing with this alongside Oracus0's [The Matriarch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49019), though to have my model appear in-game you'll have﻿ to either load this mod AFTER The Matriarch, or merge the two.
