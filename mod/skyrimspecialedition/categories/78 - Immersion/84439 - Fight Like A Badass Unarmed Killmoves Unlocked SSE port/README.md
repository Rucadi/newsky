**Ported by request.  It's janky (very) and just uses current animations for maces/daggers without the weapon.  There is no intention to improve this mod at present state, just making it available and fixing for DLCs/SE.**
  
  
Now you can pummel your way to cool finishers all day against Draugr, Wolves, Spiders, Giants and the ultimate challenge to PUNCH A DRAGON TO DEATH.
  
Compatible with Killmove mods such as The Dance of Death, just make sure this one is BELOW any of on the load order.
  
Also check out [Skeleton Killmoves Unlocked](http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/37621/) so you can smash those skeletons to pieces with your bare hands.
  
  
Installation:
  
Extract into the Skyrim/Data folder and make sure it is checked on the load order; that's it!
  
Also available on the Steam Workshop [here](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=155626477).
  
  
Compatibility:
  
Incompatible with DUEL - Combat Realism (at this time)
  
  
This uses current animations in the game that are used by different weapon types, ones that fit well have been added because no creatures had any unarmed killcams assocated with them.
