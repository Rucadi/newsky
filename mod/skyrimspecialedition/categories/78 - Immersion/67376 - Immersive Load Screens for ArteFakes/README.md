[font=Georgia]﻿Note: This patch does **NOT** add new load screen images, change the font, or alter the UI format.
  
All of that is up to your own modlist!
  
This patch **only edits the load screen messages** added to the game by [ArteFakes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41254)﻿.

**I made this for myself** and thought I'd share it with the community. This patch **rewrites the 56 load screen messages** that come with the artifact overhaul **ArteFakes**, by registrant (hosted on SE NExus by **deletepch**). I noticed a few grammar issues while sitting through these load screens, as well as the unusual brackets at the end identifying each message. There were also quite a number of inaccurate references to TES Lore—likely a product of them being translated from English, to Russian, and then back to English. All of this has been fixed, and more.
  
  
  
**There's not much else to explain, so I'll outline each of the basic changes below with an example.**
  
  
  
  
**Changes:**

**﻿ 
  
Removed the bracketed nametag at the end of every message.**

**Before:**
> **The best friend in the woods is a good axe.
>   
> [ArteFakes]﻿**

**After:**
> **A woodsman's best friend is a good axe.**

**﻿   ﻿Fixed all spelling, grammar, and lore issues.**

**Before:**
> **The First Era Arch-Mmage Gauldur's Blackblade rests in Folgunthur. After centuries of oblivion, the sword is still sharp.**

**After:**
> **Mikrul Gauldurson wielded Gauldur's Blackblade as one of three brothers who committed patricide in a lust for power. They wreaked havoc before being slain by Arch-Mage Geirmund and his battlemages. Mikrul fell in Folgunthur, near Solitude's arch.**

**﻿Added context to some messages where it seemed fitting.**

**Before:**
> **Briarheart Geis is the weapon of the Forsworn who carry the Hagraven's Briar Heart in their chests. Its enchantment is fatal to the Nords.
>   
> [ArteFakes]**

**After:**
> **The Briarheart Geis is a weapon carried by Forsworn whose hearts are taken by hagravens, then ritualistically replaced with poisoned seeds of briar heart trees. The weapon's enchantment is especially deadly to Nords.**

**Revised all notes on mechanics to be more immersive.**

**Bef****ore:**

> **Leveled weapons have a number in their name (for example, 2/5 is the second of five), and they can be improved at the Skyforge by possessing the book "Forge, Hammer and Anvil" and the skills of an Arcane Blacksmith (usually at levels 6, 12, 19, 27, and 36+).
>   
> [ArteFakes]**

**After:**
> **The book "Forge, Hammer, and Anvil" is said to contain knowledge vital to any arcane smith seeking to enhance artifacts to their greatest potential.**

**Corrected quotes back to their full English versions, with adherence to vanilla format.****Before:**

> **"Whoever found this note, let it be known that I, Acilius Bolar, is the last... " - from Bolar's note.
>   
> [ArteFakes]**

**After:**
> **"...I, Acilius Bolar, last of the Blades to survive the attack on Cloud Ruler Temple...go forth to meet my death with honor. If you are worthy, take up my blade and do the same." -- Acilius Bolar, Bolar's Writ**

**That's the gist of it.****Stay safe and have fun.**
