Hi !
  
  
Currently I'm playing with Skyrim particles.
  
When I found myself in front of a fire in the middle of a storm I asked myself: "Is it possible that these sparks react to the wind like a real fire?"
  
Yes it is possible and without ESP.
  
  
Enjoy !
  
  
It is highly recommended to use with [Rudy fix for Smoke](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78495) !

**Settings**

  
As there are many weather mods, the effect will not be more or less important depending on which one you use. My setting is made for Obsidian but should work for most other weather mods.
  
If you find the effect too strong or not strong enough, you can adjust it like this:
  
  

Open this Nif with Nifskope
  
Find the **BSWindModifier** (Wind1) and modify the numeric value "**Strength**"
  
React **LESS** to the wind <= **3,0000** => React **MORE** to the wind
