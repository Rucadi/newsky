Ryn's Bleak Falls Tower
  
  
One of the first locations we've all visited on our first playthrough, and one we almost certainly always visit in every playthrough after, the Bleak Falls Tower is a kind memory that I did not want to change too much.
  
It always bothered me how the tower looked so unsupported by the ground beneath it. I fixed that.
  
The inside was boring and held little to look at. I fixed that too.
  
No direct increase to difficulty, but a tiny increase in the loot you will find here, as before there really was nothing at all aside from the loot off of the bandits you find. Very minimal, but I feel it was needed.
