**About:**
  
  
Have you ever found yourself in a dungeon, distracted by the shiny glint of a septim, the many facets of a diamond or the gleaming blade of an enchanted sword? your mind is elsewhere and before you know it, you've ran into a tripwire and nordic statues are spitting poisoned darts in every direction! An exciting scenario for sure, but what if you had tripped? How would that have changed the story? JS Immersive Tripwires aims to put the trip back in tripwire. 
  
  
• Tripwires will now trip up any NPC's (including the Player) that run into them.
  
• Conjure Tripwire: Allows the caster to place up to 20 tripwires (default: 15), which self-despawn after 60 seconds
  
  
**An MCM Menu also allows you to control features such as:**• Conjured Only: Only tripwires spawned by the Player will cause tripping
  
• Assault Alarm (If NPC's should blame the Player when tripping on Conjured Tripwires)
  
• Boots Affect Tripping: When armored boots are worn, the chance of tripping will have a further 50% reduction
  
  
**Note:** For a full list of MCM Options, check the screenshot of the menu in the gallery

**Known Issues / FAQ:**
  
  
1) Tripwires aren't made for tripping people!
  
• The tripwires in Skyrim are made of a thicker, rope-like material and you would certainly trip over it! especially at speed.
  
  
2) Compatibility issues?
  
• Only if another mod changes tripwires too. I'm not aware of any currently.
