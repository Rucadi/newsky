# Sink of Scrubbing - Interactive Wash Basins
- Author: Jake Query
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92844


Enhances immersion & roleplaying by making wash basins useable, giving you the choice of either grooming yourself or refreshing yourself. Refreshing yourself will provide a small buff to Resist Disease & Speechcraft after cleaning for 2 hours. Wash basins can be used freely (for now) wherever you might find them, thus only a small buff will be applied. In a future release I'll try to make it so you have to rent an inn room or own the cell you're in, in order to use the basin.
  
  
**Features**
  
  

  
* Makes Wash Basins useable by letting you Groom (open the racemenu) or "Refresh yourself".
Refreshing yourself will grant you a 25% bonus to Resist Disease & give you a +5 to Speechcraft.
  
* Built-in support for Dirt and Blood. Will not fully clean the character, but set it to the lowest level of dirtiness. Similar to how swimming in water works in D&B. **Dirt & Blood effects will override Sink of Scrubbins clean effect**
Built-in support for Keep It Clean.
  
* Following the principle set by Dirt & Blood: Animation will run on where you stand to avoid forcing the PC to a marker, to reduce a janky feel.

**Compatibility**
  
  

  
* Built-in compatibility for Dirt and Blood - Dynamic Visuals.
Should be compatible with anything that places the vanilla Wash Basin as BoS will swap the object.
  
* Obviously not compatible with Interactive Wash Basins or Interactive Wash Basins - Base Object Swapper.

  
**Known issues**

  
* When using with **Better Third Person Selection**, the marker appears at the bottom of the basin, on the floor for some reason.

  
  
**Recommended mods**
  
  

  
* [Water in Wash Basins](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59333)﻿. This will add water to the basins, which looks a lot better than the vanilla empty basins.
[Dirt and Blood - Dynamic Visuals](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38886)﻿. Adds a dirtiness system to the player.
  
* [Water in Wash Basins - Mesh-only replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59333)﻿ Adds water to the wash basins for *immersion.*

* This mod is provided as-is. Don't count on extensive support (shouldn't be needed)
Be aware that it's near-impossible to debug why something doesn't work if you have a lot of mods installed.
