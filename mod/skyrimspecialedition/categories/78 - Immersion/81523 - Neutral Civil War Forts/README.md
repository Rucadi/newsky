# Neutral Civil War Forts
- Author: Enodoc
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81523
The Civil War military forts are initially occupied by bandits, Forsworn, warlocks or necromancers, but the Imperials or Stormcloaks would move in the first time you cleared the hostile enemies out. With this mod, the enemies will instead respawn indefinitely if you have not started the Civil War, and the Imperials and Stormcloaks will not garrison them. Or you can choose to claim the fort for the Hold, and allow the Jarl's guards to garrison the fort instead.
  
  
Main Features
  
  

  
* **New in 1.2:** Choose whether the forts start off with hostile enemies, Hold guards, or a military garrison.
**New in 1.1:** Takeover functionality similar to [Lawbringer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29882) and [Realistic Conquering](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26396) for the nine military forts.
  
* **New in 1.1:** Military forts can now be garrisoned by guards of the current Hold, in addition to the Civil War factions.
**New in 1.1:** Once a fort has been cleared, find the war horn at the fort entrance banner to claim the fort for the Jarl.
  
* **New in 1.1:**Any claimed fort can be abandoned using the war horn at the fort entrance banner to reset the hostile enemies.
**New in 1.1:**If you are Thane of the Hold, you can order the Lieutenant to turn the fort over to the military factions at any time.
  
* **New in 1.1:**Once the Civil War is over, you can order the Fort Commander to disband the garrison, setting the fort back to Neutral.
If you don't claim the fort, the hostile enemies (bandits, warlocks, necromancers, Forsworn) will respawn until you start the Civil War.
  
* When you start the Civil War and Jarl Balgruuf has chosen a side, the military factions will start to garrison the forts after you clear them.

  
Note that when claiming or abandoning the fort using the war horn, or when ordering the Lieutenant or Commander to change the garrison to a different faction, you will need to leave the fort and return later to see the changes.
  
  
Other Features
  
  

  
* **New in 1.2:** Any previously cleared forts will be reset when you install this mod. Useful if you don't plan to do the Civil War!
**New in 1.1:** Forts can now be flagged as Cleared on the World Map by killing all the hostile enemies including the boss.
  
* Added Forsworn enemies to all interior cells of Fort Sungard during its Forsworn occupation.
Fixed an error in CWFortObserver which prevented forts after the first one from repopulating with a military garrison when cleared.
