Immersive Patrols adds Stormcloak, Thalmor, Imperial and Dawnguard patrols to Skyrim and a few roaming Skaal, Reaver and Rieklings to Solstheim. These patrols can cross paths with each other or the player creating new encounters.
  
  
Completing the Civil War quest will disable all patrol and battle NPCs (including Thalmor) of the losing faction leaving only your troops. If you destroy the remaining enemy camps after the Civil War quest is completed, your own troops in this mod will diminish as they are no longer needed, effectively ending the Civil War within the mod as well.
  
  
Civil War NPCs in this mod will attack you on sight depending on your allegiance. This is done using a custom faction that mimics the behavior of the "Battle for Fort X" Civil War quest NPCs and does not affect Vanilla (Bethesda's) NPCs. 
  
  
Dawnguard patrols within this mod will only exist after reconstruction of Fort Dawnguard has begun.
  
  
Note: Using an "always enabled" version of the mod will disable the above mechanics. Civil War patrols and Dawnguard will always exist and respawn.
  
  
  
=====Important Information=====
  
  
As of 3.0 Immersive Patrols sources it's NPC appearance from vanilla NPCs so most old patches made specifically for Immersive Patrols are no longer needed or may cause crashes. Almost all of the changes found in the mod "Immersive Patrols Simplified" and even it's comments were also implemented.
  
  
NPCs respawn.
  
NPC stats scale 10-81.
  
SSEedit cleaned.
  
No mod dependencies.
  
No scripts.
  
No SKSE dependencies.
  
No mod menu.
  
Works mid Playthrough.
  
  
=====Know Issues=====
  
  
Unfortunately this mod will no longer load on Skyrim versions before 1.6.1130 without an [index incrementing mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441) ([VR equivalent](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106712)).
  
  
Forced Civil War Allegiance: During the Main Quest "Season Unending," depending on your dialogue choices during the peace talks you will be added to one of the two Civil War factions. You will be seen as that faction by this mod's NPCs.
  
  
Solution: You are now forced to pick a side and can no longer remain neutral. Speak to Rikke or Galmar Stone-Fist to join the faction you actually support. This change will be reflected immediately.
  
  
Faction Change: If you join a Civil War faction THEN switch factions during the Main Quest "Jagged Crown" or by the use of a mod you will still be seen as the betrayed faction by this mod's NPCs until they respawn.
  
  
Solution 1: Wait 11 in-game days in an interior to spawn new NPCs OR uninstall Immersive Patrols, save the game without it installed and then reinstall.
  
  
Solution 2: Console Commands. Thanks to cyx19961111 for this solution! His comment is below;
  
  
"Another solution for PC player is use console to remove faction that keep your neutral after main quest.
  
  
player.addtofaction 2bf9a -1(Remove from Imperial faction,if Stormcloak attack you)
  
player.addtofaction 2bf9b -1(Remove from Stormcloak,if Imperial attack you)"
  
  
Author's note: After all these years I am confident enough to solve these issues by editing the vanilla scripts that create them but I have decided to leave the mod as is, a humble esp mod with minor issues related to switching sides with known solutions.
  
  
=====Incompatible Mods/Mods that require a small patch=====
  
  
Mods that delete or disable the invisible vanilla enable markers from military camps.
  
Mods that delete or disable the Dawnguard Banners that appear during fort reconstruction.
