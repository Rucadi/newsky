Here is the EmbersXD version of my FYX - Campfire Reats to the Wind.
  
  
This FYX will complement my previous [FYX](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/102099) and [Rudy102](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78495?tab=description)'s mod. (They are complementary so to get the full effect you need all three.)
  
  
As the original mod is a must have, the work here is mainly done on the particles with some modification due to the node which makes them react to the wind.
  
  
> [font=Verdana]**Consider updating [EmbersXD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37085)**﻿ ![/font]

  
  
**This FYX**
  

  
* Makes the particles of the original Embers XD react to wind.
Add new ones in the Giant Campfire meshes.
  
* Remove the large white smoke of Giant Campfire and replace it with a more subtle one.
Accelerates flame particles of Giant Campfire. (I didn't find them fast enough for an outdoor fire)
  
* Version for the three EmbersXD Flames "Main" of the original FOMOD.
Version  INFERNO Flames.
  
* No ESP, install/uninstall anytimes

Enjoy !
