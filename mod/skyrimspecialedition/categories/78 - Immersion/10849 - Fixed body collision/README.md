This mod enables the body collision on dead npcs which Bethesda left disabled for their own reasons. 
  
   
   
There was a same type fix for Oldrim which added a spell to get rid of the bodies. Since the author has been long gone I decided to build same type of mod out of a scratch. So this is not a port of the Oldrim mod. This mod doesn't add any spell, it just enables the body collision on dead characters.
