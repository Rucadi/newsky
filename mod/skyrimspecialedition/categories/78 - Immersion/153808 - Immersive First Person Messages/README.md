The next generation of first person messages mod has arrived in Skyrim! Inspired by Tooplex's [Your Own Thoughts](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/762) and VorpalBlades' [Think to Yourself](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32060), Immersive First Person Messages rebuilds the concept from the ground up build on simple premises.
  
  
**Immersion and Universality:**That's a word I just learned today, by the way. Universality. It means the state of being universal, which is something that's always irked me about Your Own Thoughts. While the base game messages are nearly perfect flavor, some of the messages added in expansions or later in mods or creation club addons stick out as...very personal, as if they were written for a character I'm never going to play. So I've done away with that for IFPM, and taken care to make sure that each and every one of the thousands of messages I've written so far are as universally applicable to your character as they are to mine as possible. Of course, not all of them can be. I can only stretch a message that exclusively appears to skooma-addicted Vampires who only worship Sheogorath under the light of the Solar Eclipse so far, but overall and for the vast majority of messages, you won't have any problems having your character think them to themselves just as much as you do.
  
  
**Compatibility:**Another thing I sought to fix with IFPM was the balance patching problem. To override a GMST DATA, MGEF DNAM, or SHOU DESC using the traditional plugin method, you would need to copy over the entire record - meaning that a mod that then goes and changes your spell damage or shout cooldown needs a whole new patch to accommodate the new message. What if instead of having Base>Message Mod>Overhaul>Overhaul with Messages, we cut out all the middlemen and found a way to just have your chosen balancing, no matter what you did to it? Enter Dynamic String Distributor, gracefully replacing the plugins, records, and overrides of the past with a script applied at runtime to make focused changes targeted at only what needs to be a changed. With Immersive First Person Messages, you're free to run as many shout and magic overhauls as you want while remaining confident that the description only reverts to second person if YOU want it to.
  
  
**Simplicity of Use and Editiing:**Let the days of loading up xEdit and desperately searching for the FormID of the message you want to change - or need to fix - be gone forever. With IFPM, changing a message is as simple as opening a json and searching for what you see on screen - then replacing it with anything you want. From now on, cats really can be bats can be rats can be hats can be gnats can be thats can be thises.
  
  
Immersive First Person Messages is an ongoing project of mine, and I mean to add a great deal to it. More messages and spells, expanding on optional lines, correcting typos, refining messages, keeping up to date with Dynamic String Distributor, and writing and updating community requested patches are plans I intent to continue taking an active hand in. I encourage everyone to drop by the articles tab to learn how to write your own patches, the forums tab to request mods I should take a look at, the bugs tab to report any formatting or spelling errors - I am only human, after all! - and the posts if you ever just have a question or need to chat. I want to hear from you about what you want next and what I can be doing better. I don't forsee IFPM dying until I do or modding does.
  
  
There are two main files included in the FOMOD - you only technically need the first, but the other, IFPM Expansion, is of interest to players looking to hopefully remove the last vestiges of reminders they're playing a video game. It isn't big right now, but it does include some lines that didn't strictly need to be changed - that is, the original wasn't in second person - but I felt could use a bit of love anyway. More black books, game settings like autosaving, and finishing up most vanilla shouts are included in that file. More will be added as I (or users) find them!
  
  
Also included in the FOMOD are patches I've written to extend IFPM functionality to other mods' messages. As of version 1.0, these patches are only for mods I personally use, but I plan to expand the list over time as I find other mods in my load order that need it, or as they become requested.

Special thanks to SkyHorizon for Dynamic String Distributor, and for their BOUNDLESS patience with me as I figured out how to use it, and to godzilla90fan for helping playtest the mod. Wouldn't have been possible without you guys.
