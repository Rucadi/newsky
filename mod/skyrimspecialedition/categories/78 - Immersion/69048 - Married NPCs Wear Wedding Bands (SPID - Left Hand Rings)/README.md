**DESCRIPTION**
  
  
With this plugin, married NPCs covered by the base game and DLCs are distributed wedding bands through [Spell Perk Item Distributor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869). If you're using a mod like [Immersive Rejections](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67930), this could be an easy way to ensure the person you are hitting on isn't married. Adds a new, left-handed gold ring mesh based on [SMIM](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/659/). No NPC patches required.

**LORE**
  
  
Most married [NPCs](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:People) are now given gold rings to signify that they are married, with some exceptions.
  
  
If a character works a profession where it would plausibly make little sense for them to wear a ring (like [Enmon](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Enmon) the miner, or [Alvor](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Alvor) the blacksmith), they will not wear one. Characters in relationships of poor standing (such as [Frabbi](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Frabbi), [Kleppr](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Kleppr), [Beitild](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Beitild), [Olda](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Olda), or [Leigelf](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Leigelf)) will not wear their wedding bands. On the contrary, characters with deceased partners may still be wearing their wedding bands (such as [Thoring](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Thoring), or [Captain Lonely-Gale](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Captain_Lonely-Gale)).
  
  
Beyond that, very little creative liberty was taken. If an NPC wasn't marked as married in the Creation Kit, they weren't given a ring.
  
No self-inserts or random carriage drivers suddenly having a family or backstory. Maybe another time.

*There are close to 100 married NPCs in the vanilla game.*

  
  
**COMPATIBILITY**
  
  
While not observed in testing, there is a possibility an item may not be shown due to a character's outfit taking priority.
  
This is uncommon and, mostly, unavoidable with the current implementation. Use

```
showinventory
```

to check if you want.
  
  
The new wedding band uses armor slot 51.
  
The ring material colors are achieved by editing the vertex colors.
  
Compatible with any jewelry retexture that uses the same texture paths as SMIM
