EDIT: This series is for the most part discontinued. This may sound hypocritical, and perhaps it is, but I have an aversion to using AI generative tools now for these mods. It's simply not comparable to work created by real human talent. I'll always appreciate my community, and the fans around my work. But for the foreseeable future, I will not use AI again. I will remain a modder, however, all voice work shall be done through genuine, talented voice-actors. Either way, thank you all for your support and appreciation all the same. 
  
  
Ever get tired of hearing Imperial soldiers say the same thing over and over again? I did. So I created this mod to address that... As mentioned above, "Dialogue Expansion - Imperial Soldiers" adds an abundance of greet lines to any Imperial soldiers you may meet in your journeys across Skyrim. On top of this, there's 13 additional scenes added to the Imperial soldier 'pool'--this nearly triples the amount of scenes available to Imperial soldiers. Most of these scenes are available to the player regardless of progress in the Imperial questline; some are only available once the player has begun to liberate Skyrim from the Stormcloaks (aka progress through the Imperial questline). 
  
  
Let me know what ya'll think! Till next time!

\*A note on voices: You'll notice sometimes NPCS with the same voicetype talking to each other; this is not a bug. This is how Bethesda implemented conversations between Civil War soldiers. In vanilla, all scenes between Imperial Soldier NPCs are determined on a "non-Commander Voicetype" and in "ImperialFaction" basis--so this naturally leads to soldiers with the same voicetype conversing often. I did not stray from this mechanic. There are, of course, several scenes between different voicetypes. 
  
  
\*Another note: some splicing was used (aka used a laugh from the base game audio files). 
  
  
\*Compatible with everything. 
  
  
**\*I highly highly recommend downloading and enabling "Realistic Conversations" by "Gorgulla". With this enabled, you can hear the conversations play out more than vanilla. https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1717**
  
  
\*And let me give a hearty thank you to "YoungEmmaWatson" for porting many of my mods to Xbox already; your work is noticed and appreciated... If you wish to port, YoungEmma, no permission needed, my friend. 
  
  
**Disclaimer: I do not condone any dialogue created via 11labs (or any other source of AI voice synthesis technology) that is heinous, perverse, lewd, defamatory, and/or disrespectful to the voice actors/actresses and/or their in-game portrayal**.**[u] I do not accept donation points, nor shall I ever set up a means to derive compensation from these lines of mods in any way, IE: Patreon, Paypal, Cashapp, etc.**[/u]
  
  
An enormous thank you to "quietlychamil" for their work in creating custom race compatibility patches. 
  
  
A giant thank you to all the translators out there: you know who you are! Much love. 
  
  
Let me give a major thank you to BGS and the following Voice Actors/Voice Actresses in the original cast of Skyrim. Their performances far outshine the world of AI synthesis technology. Thank you for bringing Skyrim to life all those years back.
