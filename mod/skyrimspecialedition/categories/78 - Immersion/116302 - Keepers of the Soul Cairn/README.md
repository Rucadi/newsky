The Boneyard Keepers, one of Skyrim's most unique encounters in an already unique area. Jailors of Valerica, shepherds of trapped souls, servants of the Ideal Masters, and overseen by Durnehviir, they wield gigantic bones as their weapons and are partially made of a dark, abyssal mist.
  
  
Despite this, their armor is incredibly lacking. Dragonplate, while strong and intimidating, doesn't stand out as anything unique to undead soul-reapers. This mod intends to change that, giving them dark rags and decorative bones, and revealing part of their ethereal body that I believe is more fitting of their mist-like face.
  
  
This mod should be compatible with most mods, since it doesn't *technically* touch the Keepers themselves, only their armor and race model. This means that mods that edit their difficulty level should be compatible, assuming that they're loaded before this.
  
Otherwise, merging this and the other mod through SSEedit should solve any issues.
  
  
And, of course, ESL Flagged :)
