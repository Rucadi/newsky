# Autographs (Of Skyrim)

If you have a book in your inventory and talk to the book's author, you can ask to sign it. And they will sign them. That's it. Immersive.
  
  
Technically signed books are separate object, so if you have a mod changing book records, you would need a simple patch. Synthesis patches should handle that automatically.
  
  
The list of covered books:
  

  
* "A Gentleman's Guide to Whiterun" by Mikael
"Children of the All-Maker" by Tharstan
  
* "Dwarves I, II, III" by Calcelmo
"A Primer on Enchanting" by Sergius Turrianus
  
* "Ghosts in the Storm" by Adonato Leotelli
"Olaf and the Dragon" by Adonato Leotelli
  
* "Ruminations on the Elder Scrolls" by Septimus Signus
"Shadowmarks" by Delvin Mallory
  
* "The Aetherium Wars" by Taron Dreth (I know)
"Chaurus Pie: A Recipe" by Nils
  

  
The esp is flagged as esl.
  
I did not add signs containing player's name as it requires spawning books and I am not sure I can do that without compromising the esl flag.
