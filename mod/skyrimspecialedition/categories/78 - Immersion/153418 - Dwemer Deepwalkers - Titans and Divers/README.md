Just adds a bit more depth to the dwemer lore.
  
New enemies and loot(Spells, armor and weapons) to various dwarven locations throughout Skyrim, Solstheim and the 'Aetherium Wars' locations.
  
  
**DISCLAIMER ABOUT THE MOUNTS:**
  
[font=Courier New][/font]
  
The mount system is VERY broken and causes **CRASHES when unsummoning**,
  
this is due to the skeleton I am using.
  
 I am unable to dedicate the time to fix it currently.
  
  
The main file is a version without the mount feature, you can still use those summons but they will not be rideable.
  
The mount version is in the optional files, download at your own risk.
  
  
Some details and lore below.
  
  
**Colossi:**Spoiler
  
![](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/153418/153418-1750677603-431491920.png)﻿**Lore:**The Brass colossi were titanic constructs, employed as war platforms.
  
They allowed Dwemer generals to gain a greater vantage over the battlefield.
  
However, they were decomissioned long before the disappearance of the dwemer people,
  
mainly due to their rebellious nature
  
 as the Nature spirits used as fuel, overtook their programming.
  
  
Now, a select few still roam in the hidden places of Skyrim, their minds now a melding of nature and machine.
  
They are completely passive, or at least, mortals are too small to be of any notice.
  
Both versions can be summoned and ridden.
  
(Beat Axonn if you want the spell tomes)
  
  
**Armor types:**Spoiler
  
![](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/153418/153418-1750677557-1420871330.png)﻿**Lore:**
  
  
These Dwemer suits house a self contained environment which protects them fully
  
 against the crushing depths and boiling heat of even the darkest oceanic abyss and as such, they are quite strong against weapons as well.
  
(Volcanic, Standard, Glacial)

**Ultra deep dive suit**More of a submersible which happens to allow the use of limbs.
  
This suit's inflexibility is made up for by its protective qualities against oceanic pressure.
  
  
  
  
**Bathyscaphe types:**
  
Spoiler

**Lore:**Although much dwemer construction was left to the automatons, certain activities still required a dwemeric touch.
  
Many Bipedal crafts were thus built that could protect the pilot from the harsh environments of the deep.
  
With their creators long gone, the autopilot protocol has taken over, leaving these shells to wander about aimlessly.

Tarnished Bathyscaphe(poison)
  
Restored Bathyscaphe(Shock)

A true Dwemer amongst Dwemer, totally obsessed with the idea of melding flesh and metal.
  
Even among the dwemer he found few volunteers willing to give up all their flesh.
  
As such his army consists of the unfortunate and the unwilling, of criminals and those kidnapped.
  
Their minds slowly melted away as they became accustomed to their Brass shells.
  
Axonn performed his final operation being on himself.
  
His crimes proved grave, even for the dwemer, sealing him deep under the earth to rot.
  
So far gone was his mind that when the dwemer disappeared from Mundus, he was not taken with them.

![](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/153418/153418-1750792393-366241761.png)﻿**Aria, perfect automaton**A relic of a bygone age, even by the peak of Dwemer civilization.
  
Once, an engineer built a perfect automaton, programmed a mind so complex that itnever awoke.
  
So goes the legend, in truth she did awake, long after the dwemer disappeared.
  
Finding herself alone, she naively freed the dubious Axonn.
  
Together they sought Bthalft, home of the Aetherium Forge, to perhaps create another like her.
  
But when Aria learned of Axonn's crimes, she shut herself off inside the forge.
  
Vowing to guard it from any foolish organic who would missuse its power.

Dwemer Flyers are small, docile little work drones that amused and delighted their creators,
  
Acting as good travelling companions, recording their adventures for later viewing.
