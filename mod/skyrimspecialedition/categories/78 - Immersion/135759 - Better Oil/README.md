Hey everyone!
  
  
This is a small mod that took a lot of tweaking to get to this stage and I'm still planning further work on it. The original oil trap puddles in Skyrim have pixelated textures and are very low poly. There are a few mods that fix the textures on these puddles but none that address the shape of the puddles too. That's what I've attempted to do with this mod. It replaces both the mesh and the textures while keeping the puddles in a vanilla style. 
  
  
These puddles will also reflect the scenery correctly thanks to an ENB dynamic cubemap. See the gallery. ENB is required. 
  
  
Q: Hey, buddy, these don't look like oil, what gives?
  
A: You may well be thinking of oil on water. That's not what these are. The trap oil would likely be something viscous and flammable such as an olive oil or even a whale/horker oil (smelly).
  
  
Q: Wait, wait...I like my current textures and yours look a bit...slippery.
  
A: No worries, just download the mesh only version which works with any retextures. Enjoy!
  
  
Q: What's all this further work you're alluding to?
  
A: This mod replaces the basic puddle with a slightly Better one but I think I could make them better again and add regional variants...more on that soooooon (that's a modding soon (aka when it's done), not a normal soon).
  
  
Thanks for checking out the mod and enjoy!
