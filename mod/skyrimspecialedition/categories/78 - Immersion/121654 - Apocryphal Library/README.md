[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]WHAT DOES THIS MOD DO?
  
  
**Firstly**, This mod uses [Base Object Swapper (BOS)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805) to change **static piles of paper**, and the **smaller book stacks** from Apocrypha into **containers which contain readable loot!** At last you can actually browse the eternal library of the Demon of Knowledge!
  
  
**Secondly**, It adds **LOT OF NEW BOOKS**, mostly written by me and firmly tied into the Elder Scrolls universe, with a few from other Elder Scrolls games and their developers.

**There is at least one skillbook for each skill in this mod - and some have two!**[/font]
  
  
  
**The mod allows you to find the following things when looting book stacks and note piles:**
  
  
**- New books** and notes by me, on a variety of TES subjects from the mundane to the bizarre. All written within Elder Scrolls Lore (from the mundane to the divine)
  
  
**- Lore books** from other TES games (Redguard, Morrowind, Daggerfall, ESO, Oblivion, Shadowkey, Battlespire). I have tried to avoid crossover with the highly recommended [Lost Library](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/902) mod.
  
  
**- Letters and notes** from those games, for example the letter that caused the Daggerfall plot - yes, you can own the original!
  
  
**- Books** from authors on The Imperial Library
  
  
**- Untranslated notes and tomes** of Apocrypha text (these -can- be translated if you REALLY want but it would be a lot of work for not much gain). These represent the majority of the books you see around the daedric realm, long since translated into strange glyphs by the mysteries of the Gardener of Men.
  
  
**- Books in the Sload language!** Including a three-volume book on Haemorrhoids which I imagine the community has always wanted
  
  
**- Spell tomes and scrolls** (will use levelled lists, so you should find stuff from  your mods)
  
  
**- Vanilla books** (as above)
  
  
  
**Other ways to find the new books:**
  
  
- The addon for Bibliophile's Arcaneum adds most of the books from the mod into that mod's shelving system, meaning you can read them at your leisure.
  
  
- The Levelled List addon file adds a lot of the books to the vanilla game's levelled lists, meaning you will find them in bookshelves and so on.
  
  
**The mod ALSO adds a few new books around the game world. Some of these are unique books, see the articles page for spoilers or just get started by checking Anise's basement.**Some of the letters, especially ones like the plot letters from Daggerfall, are in hand-placed versions of the note-pile containers. These ones won't respawn, and each one contains a particular game's items. You'll have to scour Apocrypha for them (but you'll probably bump into them eventually).
  
  
There's also two smaller hand-placed stacks that contain unique journals from the other TES games. 
  
  
  
  
  
**How to Install:**
  
  
Just use Vortex or your other fave mod manager. Otherwise, just extract the zip directly to your Data folder. There should be two files and a folder that go into your Data folder. The .esp file, the \_SWAP.ini, and the folder that contains the book art. 
  
  
**Updating:**
  
  
It should be fine to update this mod without starting a new game.
  
  
**Optional Files:**
  
  
This mod has additional files. The Levelled List distribution mod does exactly that - distributes some of the books into the levelled lists of rarer books.
  
The [Biblophile's Arcanaeum](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26772) integration patch adds some of the books into the bookshelves of that most excellent mod by SomethingObscure.
  
You should almost certainly make a bashed patch using either of these.
  
  
**Compatibility:**
  
  
Should run fine with basically anything. [SD's Lotta Patches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/88051)﻿ has files that will resolve some conflicts with USSEP and Dawnguard Map Markers.
  
Mods that alter the layout of dungeons may displace some hand-placed books - [Reimperialized Fort Frostmoth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/134592) now has a patch [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106790) courtesy of ChickenMike!
  
  
  
**Questions, Frequently Asked or Otherwise (FAQ)
  
  
ESL FLAGGED?**
  
Yes!
  
  
**IS THIS MOD LORE FRIENDLY?**
  
Yes! Remember that the lore of the Elder Scrolls is particularly strange and mutable, and the notion of 'canon' is a little hazy. Books may have been written - and often are - by unreliable narrators. With that in mind, these books cover a variety of unusual topics, from the relatively simple to the deepest and weird. You can read about goblins, poisonous plants, trolls... or the Reman moon-colonies, Nibenayan insect cults, dragon breaks, and much more.
  
  
**I FOUND A BOOK WITH GLITCHY, DUPLICATED TEXT! WHAT DO?**
  
I've tried to iron all of these out, but a few might remain! Report these in the comment section please and thank you!
  
  
**THERE'S WEIRD IMAGES THAT JUST SAY IMG WHERE THERE SHOULD BE A PICTURE?**
  
If that's happening, the Book Art hasn't installed properly. The artwork for the books should be in data/textures/interface/books/ApocLib
  
Try installing it manually. If it doesn't install automatically then I've done something wrong and will try to fix it, let me know in the comments!
  
  
**ARE THESE SLOAD BOOKS TRANSLATED THE SAME WAY AS THE ONE FROM MORROWIND?**
  
Yes!
  
  
**WILL THIS MOD BE UPDATED?**
  
The current planned updates for the future are:
  
- The Banned Book update, which will feature lore that the Thalmor have sequestered away. Boooo.
  
- The Hidden Library of Vivec update, which will feature the lost wisdom of the Tribunal Temple, saved from the Red Year at the last moment
  
These MIGHT end up being separate mods so as to avoid feature creep - I've already placed books in a few non-Apocrypha locations. 
  
  
**WHO WROTE A PARTICULAR BOOK/NOTE I JUST FOUND? WAS IT YOU OR BETHESDA OR SOMEONE ELSE?**
  
Check [this](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/7247) article for credits - and [this](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/7248) one for art credits. 
  
  
**WHAT ARE THE WEIRD TEXT BOOKS?**
  
Those are books in the language of ???? the Et'Ada? Hermaeus himself? It's just called 'Mage Script'. Most books in Apocrypha get translated into this text eventually. It's not worth translating them but if you do, there is readable text (it's usually from an ancient Greek medical text by Hippocrates, but contains no real world references).
  
  
**IS THIS COMPATIBLE WITH X?**
  
Almost certainly. No vanilla levelled lists are edited by this mod - the book stacks will contain vanilla lists, but it won't modify them - for instance, a book stack container usually contains: 5x apocryphal tome (unreadable mage script or possibly another language), 3 new tomes (each with a small chance for 0), 2 vanilla tomes, and 2 low-chance spell tomes. The spell tomes are vanilla lists stacked inside new levelled lists that lower the chance, for compatibility. So far it works!
  
  
There are a **small** number of world edits. Worst case scenario will usually be a book on the floor somewhere. Check [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/7251) for a list of world edits (mild spoilers for unique book locations). [SD's Lotta Patches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/88051) will resolve some conflicts with USSEP and Dawnguard Map Markers.
  
  
**THERE'S LORE I DON'T LIKE/THINK IS CANON!**
  
I've tried hard to keep everything well within the weird and world remit of TES Deep Lore. TES lore is a strange thing, meaning different things to different people. The books in this mod will lean into both well-established things that happened in the games and official background books, as well as more fringe aspects that appear in unofficial developer works. Things like the thousand cults of Nibenay, Jills of Aka-Tosh, Moth Ships and more will be referenced in some of these books along with the more familiar matters found in the original in-game texts. But Apocrypha is a place where knowledge from all the reaches of reality may be found - alternate timelines, previous kalpas, the distant future - so if there's something in there you don't want to be canon, then it isn't! Similarly, many of the books in TES lore are already from the point of view of unreliable narrators, liars, propagandists and Sheogorath-addled scholars. I've tried to create books that back up this dichotomy while also creating enough work that someone wanting to learn about deep lore can do so fully within the game if they so choose. But I haven't brought in anything that has its place firmly outside of TES lore. 
  
  
**HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH THE NEW BOOKS?**
  
Some just came to me, some were ones I thought needed to exist, and some are books that technically 'exist' in the TES setting but have never existed in the games or in any media, just mentioned - for example "The Altmer Antecedent" by Vingalmo mentioned in Night of Tears. The list of such books that I used as reference is [here](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Library#Mentioned_Texts). 
  
  
**CAN YOU WRITE A BOOK ON X?**
  
  
Yes, if there's a topic in the lore (within reason) that you'd like to see written about, let me know in the comments! I am always looking for more ideas for new books. Similarly, if you have your own work that you would like to see appear in game, I would be happy to feature it and credit you.
  
  
  
  
**RECOMMENDED MODS**
  
[Lost Library](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/902) by Daniel Coffey, or the [Redux version](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70272) by Xilamonstrr (definitely endorse both!) - these will add more books to the vanilla book lists that show up in the containers.
  
[Apocalypse - Magic of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1090) or pretty much any mod that adds spell books and scrolls to levelled lists - same reason as above!
  
**[Font Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2880)**by Mfcfbro
  
[Papers - HD SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33422) by ElSopa
  
[The Eloquent Reader](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16338)﻿by Sthaagg - This adds a little Speech experience every time you read a new book. I recommend Medium XP, or lower XP if you're using other mods that add books - this adds a lot of notes and things that could unbalance your Speech skill if you use the base file!﻿
  
[Become a Seeker](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/125055/) by Mlilly784 - Now you can float around and read these books in true Seeker style, having been warped by Mora's will!
  
[Rodryk's Books - Planeswalker and Other Titles](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27109) by AlistairRodryk - Beautifully written and drawn books. If you use the levelled list version, you can find them in Apocrypha!
  
[Bibliophile's Arcanaeum](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26772) - Lets you browse most of the books in Skyrim within the College Arcanaeum. If you use my integration patch, you can find a lot of these books in it too!
  
[Books of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4115) (which is integrated into [Enhanced Solitude](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27816) if you'd rather have that) adds a bookshop in Solitude. If you use the Levelled List Distribution file in the optional files, you can find some of the books from this mod there.
  
[Praedy's Apocrypha](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/127944) by PraedythXVI, a very nice retexture, remodel and refurbish of Apocrypha. Also remodels the book stacks, contents probably won't match the models but you won't care because they look awesome.
  
[Little Library - New Books in Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/135278) by LummoxJR contains some well written, lore friendly books on a variety of subjects, injected into the levelled lists (you'll need [LLOS](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/132765)) but they will therefore appear in Apocrypha too.
  
[Unmarked Locations Pack - Apocrypha](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/144408?tab=description) or [ULP - All In One](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/113660) (pending update) by GeraldMods - New areas of Apocrypha to explore and new things to see and read!

**SKYPATCHED** Integration for Levelled Lists AND Bibliophile's Arcanaeum can be found [Here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/128570?tab=description) courtesy of Hishigami. Probably easier to use this instead of the optional files on this page, no need for a bashed patch this way.
