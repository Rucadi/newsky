More to Say adds inconsequential dialogue to NPCs, constructed from the NPC greetings and miscellaneous lines from the same voice type. It is fully voiced, using existing sound files from Skyrim Special Edition. It aims to stay true to each NPC's character and story, though some liberties are taken to add character depth. Currently, this mod covers the NPCs in Whiterun, Riverwood, Shor's Stone and Karthwasten. It also adds some dialogue to the city and settlement guards.
  
  
  
**Features**
  
  
-- miscellaneous dialogue with Whiterun, Riften, Falkreath, Winterhold, Riverwood, Shor's Stone, Karthwasten, Ivarstead, Dragon Bridge, Whistling Mine and Rorikstead NPCs (see [this article](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/3133) for details on which NPCs are covered).

**Installation / Uninstallation**
  
  
To install, download the main files you want to install with your favorite mod manager. Or download and unzip the archives, and place the two files (the esp and the bsa) for each module in your Skyrim data directory.
  
  
To uninstall, simply delete the esps and bsas. ***Warning:*** This mod adds some scripts. My understanding is that uninstalling will spoil your active save, and you must start a new game. Generally, it is a bad idea to uninstall a mod mid-playthrough, and regardless of whether it seems to work for you, this is not supported.  
**Load Order and Compatibility**
  
  
Use LOOT to set your load order. Otherwise... More to Say goes somewhere in the middle, I suppose? Because More to Say is mostly adding new records, it should not matter much. However, for Arthmoor's [Falkreath](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21266)﻿, ensure it loads after More to Say (merged version or Falkreath module). I'm not sure LOOT will do this automatically, so you may have to create a rule for this. [Convenient Carriages](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12693), [Carriage Drivers Are Alive SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51260) and [Touring Carriages](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15948) also need to load after the Falkreath module, and possibly after the Riften and Whiterun modules as well. Same thing with Arthmoor's [Whistling Mine](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/367) and the Winterhold module. And for [Cities of the North - Dawnstar](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28952), Janquel has graciously created a small patch you can get [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30885).
  
  
This mod is compatible with most city overhauls. It should be compatible with just about everything, and incompatibilities I learn about will be catalogued here.
  
  
If you use a mod like [Unofficial High Definition Audio Project](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18115), you \*may\* notice the new lines from this mod are lower quality. I use both and can't tell, but your mileage may vary. 
  
  
[Opening Scene Overhaul SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/168) changes Hadvar's voice, so if you use it, Hadvar won't have the new lines I added for him. [Improved Follower Dialogue - Lydia](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38473) similarly changes Lydia's voice, so if you use that she won't have the new lines I added for her. [Shezzarine - The Fate of Tamriel - Prologue](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15866) revoices Onmund, so if you use that, he won't have the new lines I added for him. These are the mods I'm currently aware of that revoice vanilla characters. For other mods that do this, I may need to add conditions to ensure my dialogue using vanilla voicing doesn't surface.
  
  
[Carriage and Ferry Travel Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8379) is compatible as a special case. More to Say checks for its installation with GetFormFromFile to ensure Bjorlam and Gunjar get their dialogue, no patch required, as long as you don't merge or rename CFTO.
  
  
In a narrative sense, minor "incongruities", (where NPCs say something that doesn't make sense in the context of your game) might be expected if you are radically changing Whiterun, Falkreath, Riverwood, Rorikstead, Shor's Stone, the Main Quest, or the Civil War in your load order. 
  
  
If you use a mod to adjust bounty rewards, be aware that the quest rewards from this mod will be unaffected. I'm considering ways to potentially adjust for this in the future, but haven't settled on a direction yet.
  
  
More to Say is fully compatible with Guard Dialogue Overhaul. For SE, I'm aware of two different versions of GDO. This refers to either [Guard Dialogue Overhaul SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22075) or [Guard Dialogue Overhaul Redux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20791). Either should be compatible with More to Say.
  
  
Use of [Skyrim Reputation](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22374), [No NPC Greetings (Special Edition)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1044), [To Your Face](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24720)﻿ or a similar mod reducing the frequency of NPC greetings is highly encouraged.
  
  
My testing for 7.0 was done with:
  
  
[Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266)
  
[Immersive Citizens - AI Overhaul SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/173)
  
[Alternate Start - Live Another Life](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/272)
  
[Skyrim Reputation](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22374)
  
[Better Dialogue Controls](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1429)[Relationship Dialogue Overhaul - RDO SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1187)[Cutting Room Floor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/276)﻿
  
[Obscure's College of Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20514)
  
[Not So Fast Mage Guild](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5686)
  
[Improved College Entry - Questline Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22184)
  
  
All of these are highly recommended.
  
  
If you like this sort of mod, some other mods (by other mod authors) you might want to consider, that are, as far as I know, completely compatible:
  
  
[Misc Dialogue Edits](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28904) and [More Dialogue Options](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28905)
  
[Serana Dialogue Edit](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16222) and [Serana Dialogue Add-On](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32161)
  
[Teldryn Serious](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5541)
  
[Denizens of Morthal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33965)
  
  
If you use More to Say, you don't need [Priests Grant Blessings](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49926), as it is included in this mod.
  
  
**A Note About Repetitiveness**
  
  
While not strictly required, use of [Skyrim Reputation](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22374) or [No NPC Greetings (Special Edition)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1044) (or a similar mod that limits the frequency with which you hear greetings) is highly encouraged. I had to make a choice whether to remove the greetings I used from the NPC greetings loops. If I removed the greetings, there would be less chance you would hear the same line twice from the same NPC. But it would mean potentially having to supply patches for an unknown number of other mods that edited those greetings. I chose instead to allow for greater compatibility and leave the greetings alone. As a bonus, it makes working on this mod a bit easier as well.
  
  
Please keep in mind that, as I understand it, even the most aggressive version of No NPC Greetings will not prevent you from ever hearing the NPC's greetings: the NPCs can still offer them when you enter conversation, just not when you are 100 feet away. I prefer Skyrim Reputation myself.
  
  
So. When reporting bugs, please let me know about repetitive lines that bother you, but also let me know if you are using a mod to adjust the greetings or not. And please keep in mind that there are only so many recorded lines in Skyrim. Sometimes the only choices available are "meh", "mediocre" and the same thing I just used. So, while I may feel your pain, I may not change /fix every instance of repetitive dialogue. I hope you understand.
  
  
I found during testing that, for myself at least, using Skyrim Reputation or No NPC Greetings, repetitiveness of lines was within acceptable parameters. Your mileage may vary. This mod may not be for everyone. But I do hope you'll give it a chance. :)

**FAQ
  
  
Q:****Any plans to move on to other cities and towns?**
  
A: Yes! I'm currently taking a break to actually play the game. Next will likely be Ivarstead and/or Dragon Bridge. Riften is my great beast to be slain...
  
  
**Q:****Does this require a new game?**A: Prior to 9.0, installing a new major version of the mod for the first time required a new game. Starting with version 9.0, installing the mod for the first time no longer requires a new game. If you've already installed the major version, a minor version update *should* be safe to install on an existing game. Each version of the mod is of the form: [major].[minor] or [major].[minor].[patch]. Be sure to check the sticky post for version-specific details.
  
  
**Q: Is there an XB1 version?**
  
  
A: Yes! Thanks to Vagueraptor for the XBOX version, which can be found [here](https://mods.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/mod-detail/4289971). Currently the most up-to-date XBOX version is 9.0.1.
  
  
**Q: Is there a Skyrim LE version?**
  
  
A: Thanks to FetorMortum, there is now an LE version that can be found [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/106014)﻿. Currently the most up-to-date LE version is 9.0.
  
  
**Q: Will there be a version for [my preferred platform]?**
  
A: I do not plan to do any ports myself, but please see the permissions section of the mod. Permissions are open for some ports. Contact me please if the platform in question is not listed there.
  
  
**Q: Can I translate this mod to [my language]?**
  
A: Permissions are also open to anyone who wants to translate this mod into another language. Just credit me and notify me please. Also, please let me know what I can do to support you on this.

**Q: Is this compatible with [my favorite mod]?**
  
A: Almost certainly! I'm trying very hard to keep this compatible with other mods. It is at this point only new records, so there should not be any conflict resolution or patches required. The most likely compatibility issue you will encounter is with other mods that change the context in which the lines are given. For example, some mods might significantly changing the nature of Riverwood, the Main Quest or the Civil War. Some NPC lines in More to Say are conditioned on the player's progress in these quests, and they may no longer make sense. I hope this answer is clear enough.
  
  
**Q: Why do I keep hearing the line [X] over and over?**
  
A: Many of the NPC comments are taken from NPC greetings. To minimize conflicts with other mods, I have not edited or removed the greetings I used, or any other lines. Someone could do this, if they wanted, but conflict resolution would be required with other mods making changes to those greetings. And I prefer to keep the mod more compatible. This is why something like [No NPC Greetings](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1044) is highly encouraged as a companion to this mod.
  
  
**Q: Are you including voice files or just pointing at the existing voice files?**
  
A:  The Creation Kit requires the voice files to have particular filenames, including the associated form ids as part of the filename. I haven't found a way around this, so yes, I am including voice files in the bsa.
  
  
Some of the voice files are actually completely new, having been clipped together from existing lines of the same voice type. I sincerely hope this doesn't bother you because I've had tremendous fun making these new lines. But please let me know which lines are troubling in the comments. Feedback is very helpful.
  
  
**Q: Which version should I use?**
  
A: Most users should prefer the main version. In the main version (aka "the fomod version"), each module is an ESL-flagged ESPs. This means they does not count toward the 254 or so maximum number of plugins. As long as it's possible, advisable, and not too much of a hassle, I will prefer ESL-flagged ESPs. If you are a VR user, however, my understanding is that the ESL-flagged ESPs still end up counting toward the plugin limit, so you should prefer the optional merged version. You are, of course, welcome to use whichever you prefer.
  
  
**Q: How can I get to line X?**
  
A: Here's some general advice:
  

  
* Talking to people will unlock more dialogue for other people.
Talking to people at different stages of the early Main Quest and other local quests will unlock some dialogue that might only make sense at that point.
  
* Some dialogue depends on your factions.
Some dialogue in Riverwood in depends on whether you chose Hadvar or Ralof, or the Stormcloaks or the Empire.
  
* Some dialogue changes depending whether certain characters are alive or not.
Try not to worry too much about any particular bit. This is all pretty inconsequential dialogue. That's part of the point.
  

  
**Q: [Um, actually](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuKg-WhduhkmztJgPlUeD6c5RwnkqEjd1) Sven's ballad is a sonnet. [Don't you know the difference](https://wikidiff.com/sonnet/ballad)?**
  
A: Thanks for pointing this out. Sven describes himself as a prodigy and only spent a short time at the Bard's College. Maybe he is capable of writing great poetry, but is less aware of these sorts of distinctions.
  
  
**Q: How can I start the new quests in the Riverwood?**
  
A: Finish the Golden Claw and A Lovely Letter. Lucan will give you one. The other can come from Faendal or Sven, regardless of which one you sided with earlier.
  
  
**Q: How can I start the new quests in the Rorikstead?**
  
A: Finish Before the Storm and talk to everyone in Rorikstead at least once. Reldith can give you one quest. Sissel can give you another quest. Once you've discovered the secret of Rorikstead and decided what to do about it, either Jouane or Rorik can give you another (repeating) quest.
  
  
**Q: I'm utterly lost on discovering the secret of Rorikstead. Help?**
  
A: Start by talking to Erik the Slayer away from Rorikstead about why Rorikstead's fields are so fertile. ***[******If you don't want even minimal spoilers, stop reading now.]*** Then go back to Rorikstead, talk to people and poke around. Find the suspicious book in Rorik's Manor, then find its owner.
  
  
**Q: I really don't like those Obnoxious and Belligerent guards in Windhelm. Can you make them less obnoxious and belligerent?**
  
A: So... I like them for role-playing. For those of us who like to play white knight characters, but want to get sent to jail for doing the right thing, I put them in as an option. And yes, they are a bit racist. If you \*really\* don't like that idea, I've provided a few "outs". First, the only guards with these obnoxious dialogues are explicitly named "Obnoxious Windhelm Guard" or "Belligerent Windhelm Guard". So talk to other guards instead. Or, if you do find yourself talking to one, and leave the conversation immediately, there won't be any consequences. Or, if you are meek with them, there won't be any consequences. If you are pushy, let it go on for a while, or try a skill check and it fails, you might get in a fight with the guards, or sent to jail, or incur a bounty. And it's totally unfair. And that's the point. But also please note that it isn't \*every\* guard in Windhelm. There are just \*some\* racist guards there, and they are explicitly called out. As an extreme option, you can choose not to install the guards module, but I hope you'll give them a chance to be mean and ruin your character's day (but not yours), and role play around them. As of 9.0, you can also install the main version and choose not to install the guard encounters module.
  
  
**Q: I've found Angi. How can I get rid of the objective marker?**
  
A: Complete her archery tutorial, then thank her. Or you can kill her and tell Legate Skulnar.
  
  
**Q: How can I get Jarl Korir to summon me?**
  
A: Be the Archmage. Then talk to Tolfidr about whether he thinks you'll be a good Archmage. That should kickstart the Courier to come find you. Note that siding with the Imperials won't stop him from summoning you and he still styles himself Jarl of Winterhold, but you should get some different dialogue options in that event.
