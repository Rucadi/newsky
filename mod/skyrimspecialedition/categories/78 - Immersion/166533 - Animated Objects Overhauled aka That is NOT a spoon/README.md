Hi everyone!
  
  
As you know, I love camping in Skyrim. I love setting up a tent, a campfire, cooking my stew over the fire, with...WAIT! WHAT IS THAT? THAT IS NOT A SPOON! Yep, it's a small thing, but, wow, how it annoys me to see my character or a hunter stirring my stew with...a metal pole? A metal-coated stick? A...I've no idea what that's supposed to be. The same applies to the vanilla mortar and pestle. So, I've replaced them with something a bit better. Check out the gallery for a better idea of how the mod looks in-game. 
  
  
There is also an optional file to replace the blacksmith's hammer with one of my all-time favourite models.
