[font=Georgia]My Goal[/font]
  
  
[font=Georgia]I love The Elder Scrolls series dearly, and I want to make my favorite game feel better for everyone. 
  
There are many other modders who do amazing things, and I feel like as a group we can make Skyrim feel new in EVERY way. 
  
My goal is to update, tweak, or entirely change most of the game's exteriors of commonly visited locations and dungeons throughout Skyrim, marked as ESL when available.
  
The scope of this project is massive, as I plan to redesign the experience you will have playing Skyrim. Whether you're a longtime veteran, or a totally new player, you will have something new, exciting, and more enjoyable to explore.

[font=Georgia]Ryn's Skyrim
  
  
An ongoing project to overhaul the entirety of Skyrim's Worldspace. This will initially released in individual files, then as large AOI files, then finally in the end I will provide an all encompassing AOI file that will contain everything.
  
This will inherently make the game **more** **difficult**, as additional enemy spawns will be placed to match the increased size of most locations. And certain enemies will be changed to be a bit more difficult. As well as totally new boss enemies being introduced.
  
The largest and most well known mods in the community will always be taken into consideration as I attempt to create a product that is either easily patched, or does not require a patch. However, I will not limit my creativity to accommodate other mods. I will only try to make it as easily patched as I can while completing my vision.
  
  
I have full plans to create **open world bosses**, as well as bosses with their own **dungeons** or **worldspaces**. These bosses will massively range in difficulty, but know that open world bosses that you can easily wander into will never be on the most difficult side of the scale.
  
Bosses will potentially come with unique weapons, armors, or spells, as reward for defeating them.
  
These rewards will either be made by me, or be provided by other skilled Mod Authors.
  
  
Additional locations, are part of Ryn's Skyrim as well. New points of interest, new openworld dwellings, new dungeons and worldspaces.
  
The scope of this mod is***massive***, and will take time to be completed. 
  
  
While completing this project, I will be releasing individual locations as I finish them so that the community can enjoy them. I will try my best to provide patches for other mods that are not created by me, though only the most "important" ones will I patch. When this project is complete, I will focus heavily on patches like that, *as to work with my end product* "**Ryn's Skyrim**".
  
Until then, I will be releasing patches that allow my own individual files to work seamlessly.
  
This project aims to redesign most of Skyrim and change your entire experience. So creating patches for tons of mods as I go will only slow the process. 
  
  
**Ryn's Skyrim** individual locations are meant to work on their own, so you can choose which you like and would like to stay away from. But in the end, all locations are meant to work together. Some locations will need patches that are necessary because of this. I will provide these patches.
  
These patches will not only include fixes to allow these files to work together, but will sometimes include interactions between the two original files. Small things usually.

MOD AUTHORS
  
I am always looking for others to work with. If you would like to help with this project, please contact me on the Nexus or on Discord. I am available in both places very often. Though mostly Discord. You will almost always get a reply from me on Discord within minutes.
  
  
I'm searching for **creators** to contribute assets such as **armors** and **weapons**. This includes already created mods you may wish the be included in some way in this project. I will ALWAYS provide clear and upfront credits to those who contribute. 
  
**Level Designers** that may want to join, I am not so interested in. If you feel so compelled though, again, feel free to contact me on the Nexus or on Discord.
  
  
 Last Vigil
  
  
 The Ebony Warrior's Last Vigil ***was*** no more than a snowy mountainside, barren of any significance to his character. I felt no sense of excitement nor buildup to the fight with him, in terms of atmosphere. 
  
He held no unique items, and offered no further content after his death. 
  
The Ebony Warrior is a fantastic concept, but Bethesda did him dirty by not expanding on him, his story, and his presence in the world.
  
  
Armor and Weapon
  
  
***TLDR: Unique Armor and Weapon, as well as craftable versions.***
  
  
Now wielding a unique custom sword, and wearing a unique, powerful set of ebony armor, the Ebony Warrior has true purpose to the player, especially those who love to collect. 
  
His armor is based off of the vanilla ebony set, as to stay true to his title. But is retextured to have a glassy, near obsidian quality to its much darker hue. The set that he wears is slightly buffed in terms of vanilla enchantments that normally come with it. And both his unique set, and the armor type you may craft after defeating him and obtaining the Daedric Smithing skill, are slightly higher in armor rating than Daedric Armor, as well as weighing slightly less.
  
His sword, now a beautifully crafted scimitar to match his Redguard background, features a weapon speed of 1.2, as compared to most other swords with a speed of 1. As well as a slightly higher damage than Daedric.
  
These items were meant to be not only another option for high level players, but an option specifically for players who love the ebony armor set, but cannot continue using it into the late game, due to its lower stats.
  
  
Stat Changes
  
  
***TLDR: Slightly tankier, but hits much harder, and is more frost-focused.***
  
  
To match the Ebony Warrior's gear buffs, we've made some fairly significant changes to his NPC stats.
  
Firstly, a very minimal HP increase, and a small increase to stamina and Magicka. We don't want to turn him into a damage-sponge. That role is already filled by other bosses like Karstaag.
  
A flat 10% movement speed increase. This helps him in two ways with his slightly changed combat style. (NPC Combat style unchanged)
  
It will be considerably harder to run from him. And with his additional speed, it will be much harder to chase after him while he spams you with his Ice Storm spell. 
  
He also has a unique Frost Cloak spell that ignores resistances.
  
He has gained a multitude of additional perks. All contributing to his damage output, and additional defenses.
  
The Twin Souls perk is also added, allowing him two summons instead of only one.
  
  
 The Ebony Keep
  
  
***TLDR: A new player home***A unique player home, accompanied by an ebony mine, and tons of lore to go with it all.
  
Inside you will find the gathered riches of the Ebony Warrior, and his personal journals to read and learn more of this mysterious man.
  
You'll find letters written to him from people all across Skyrim, asking for his help, or offering him a place in their guild halls.
  
The Ebony Warrior is a man of legend, so we believed he should live like one.
  
  
Future Plans
  
  
A ton. I don't want to give away the surprises. But know that there's a lot we have spoken of in terms of further expanding this project.
  
A lot of effort went into this, and I hope you all enjoy it as much as we enjoyed making it.
  
Future plans are generally a reflection of the feedback we get from the community.
  
A short questline is very possible, furthering the high level content the player can experience.
  
  
[size=4]Compatibility
  
  
Compatible with CC The Cause and Umbra.  If you're experiencing CTD's it's most likely due to another mod in that area, like Hammet's Dungeon Pack.

FAQ
  
[/font]

[font=Georgia]
  
  
**Will you make a patch for \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?:**
  
Maybe. If you are going to ask, please ask nicely. I'm a human before I am a modder. :)
  
I focus heavily on creating new mods to add to this project, so creating patches for other mods is not on the top of my list, unless it is among the most important to have patched. If you would like niche mods to be patched, I'm sorry but you may have to seek other assistance. This project will take a very very long time as it is.
  
**If you put PATCH REQUESTS in the bug section, I will consider banning you from viewing any of my content.**
  
**I don't like this./This enemy is too hard. Can you change it for me?:**
  
Damn that's crazy.
  
  
**How do I contact you about \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?:**
  
You can message me here on the nexus, or message me on Discord. (At the bottom of this page)
  
  
**I'm having *insert bug* issue. Can you help?:**
  
Please put any issues in the bug section. They are far more likely to be taken care of that way. I see your comments. I read all of them. Seriously, I read every single comment. Adding your patch requests in the BUG section will make me considerably less likely to make the patch. 
  
**Please when reporting a bug, include images if you can. Chances are I will ask you for images regardless. Please either embed these images, or provide a link to Imgur. I will not go to any other site to view your images. If you provide a link to any other site, I will probably just delete or ignore the comment or bug report.** 
  
I **HIGHLY**suggest using a mod like [More Informative Console](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19250?tab=description) to help you pinpoint where bugs are coming from and provide that information to the correct author.
  
  
**Can you make an AIO version containing all of your mods?**
  
Not yet. 
  
That is planned for later on and will come when I have the final creation of Ryn's Skyrim. Until then, no.
  
**Can you overhaul *insert location*?**It's probably already on my list, but please feel free to request. Sometimes that's what pushes me to work on it.
  
  
**Why don't you make many patches for other mods to work with your mods?**
  
Because this project is very big. Making patches for other mods will take up an incredible amount of my time and drain me of any interest I have in completing this project. I am choosing to work on my own goal first, and then later I will pay much more attention to creating patches for other authors' work.
