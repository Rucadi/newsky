﻿**Warming Hands**

  
Now you can warm your hands like NPCs using a hotkey near a warming source.
  
  
**Features**
  

  
* Warming animations using a hotkey. Default key is B.
Warming animations holding the Activate button.
  
* Automatic warming on idle, similar to Frostall.
You can trigger the crouch warming animation while crouched.
  
* A new warmth buff when warming. Compatible with CC Survival Mode, Sunhelm and The Frozen North.

  
**Warming Animations**
  
There are multiples restrictions to activate the animations, most of them can be disabled using the MCM menu. Each time you use the hotkey, this mod will check if there is any warming source near, then it will check if the player character is facing the warming source, finally it will play the warming animation.
  
  
While your character is warming, you will get a buff that increases your warmth rating, this buff is compatible with CC Survival Mode and mods that use his features like **Sunhelm** and **The Frozen North**. For other survival mods, the buff doesn't have any effect. You can move, jump or use the hotkey to stop the warming animation of playing.
