This is a lighter version of my mod [Snores of Skyrim](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76574), based on feedback and partly inspired by a suggestion from [Jayserpa](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5201727) to make a 'lite' version.
  
  
You can read the full description on the original mod page but here's a list of what's different.
  
  

  
* Most voice types have had the volume reduced
Lip files have been removed so there is no eye or mouth movement at all
  
* Frequency of snores has been reduced slightly so you will hear snoring less often

  
That's it really. I've kept the ESP the same name so if you're using the original mod you should be fine swapping it out for this one.
  
  
**Note**: Use this one or the original one, you can't use both of them together.
