# The Dragonborn Dreams

This mod is composed of 150 distinct written dreams and nightmares your character can occasionally have, no more than one dream per day (and even then, not every time you sleep). All dreams correspond to light buffs or debuffs. The dreams are currently comprised of:
  
  

  
* 36 dreams that anyone can have relating to skills and providing light relevant buffs
\*10 nightmares that any non-vampire/werewolf can have
  

  
* \*10 nightmares unique to werewolves
\*10 nightmares unique to vampires
  
* \*14 dreams that anyone can have, which might slowly be replaced by...
\*14 nightmares corresponding to interaction with daedra and the completion of their quests
  
* 1 unique nightmare isolated to Dawnstar before Waking Nightmare is completed
31 guaranteed progression dreams that fire at certain stages of questline completion, for main quest, dlcs, factions, and a few tidbits
  
* \*10 dreams that vary by character race
\*6 dreams that vary by whether the dragonborn has completed major questlines
  
* \*8 nightmares that vary by whether you are playing as the dragonborn

  
\*Some of the dreams share 'slots' with one another. This means that while there are 150 dreams in the mod, your character will have a smaller number of potential random dreams at any given time.
  
  
For the purpose of this mod, "dragonborn" *as pertains to the above list* means The Way of the Voice is complete.
  
  
Chance of dreams firing can be toggled in an MCM menu if you have SkyUI. By default, the chance is 15% on any given sleep. Progression dreams can be turned off in the MCM.
  
  
**Warning:** Some of these dreams, particularly werewolf and vampire ones, may be unsettling for some in terms of depictions of violence or pestilence. I wouldn't say any are worse than the original Oblivion vampire nightmares.

**Patches:**There is a patch for Hand to Hand - an Adamant Addon that textually modifies the skill dreams and their buffs slightly to compensate. Patch for Requiem basically does the same, but less.
  
  
If you would prefer dreams in first person, there is a patch for that. If you use the Adamant patch, you only need one Adamant patch - the normal one or the first person one.If you use the patches, the ordering should be:
  
  
Main file
  
First person patch (if using)
  
Adamant/Requiem patch (only need one)
  
  
If you use [elmiraguth's](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/106675213)﻿ "no buffs" addon, use it as they advise, then patch as normal (except Requiem users, you don't need my Requiem patch if you're using the no-buffs addon).

**I'm not having dreams! Help!**
  
  
1 - Dreams will never fire on the *first day of a fresh save.*
  
2 - No dreams are guaranteed to fire on any given sleep.
  
3 - Only one dream may be had per day.
  
4 - As it is a base 15% chance of having most dreams/nightmares while sleeping, it could be possible that it will be multiple in game weeks before you have your first dream/nightmare.
  
  
**Adding to an ongoing save:**
  
  
I have personally experimented with this in a limited capacity. The only issue I experienced was that the magnitude of some of the effects was very slightly off.
  
  
**Compatibility:**
  
  
This mod has been tested and worked fine alongside CC Survival Mode's sleep to level up. However, one of the dream buffs (a health regen buff) does override Survival Mode's lack of health regen for the duration of the buff. YMMV as to whether that's undesirable.
