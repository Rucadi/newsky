**Underwear.dll**

  
DLL-ified version of wSkeever's [Equippable Underwear for NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45277) mod. No plugin dependencies, no hassle.
  
  
What does it do?
  

  
* If you strip an NPC's body slot and attempt to tarnish their modesty, this mod will swoop in and auto-equip a pair of undies onto the NPC.
Underwear is chosen randomly from those defined in Underwear.ini. You may add any number of underwear to choose from, as long as the forms point to body slot (slot 32) items.
  
* Does not require the original mod
Includes [Naked Dead NPC Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99024)
  
* Followers are purposefully excluded.
Blacklist option available in INI for further exclusion.
  
* Drop in replacement for [Equippable Underwear for NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45277). Can be installed as direct replacement; optionally clean with [FallrimTools Resaver](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5031/).
