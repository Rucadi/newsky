# Skypatcher Micromod - Start as Dovahkiin

Just a fun little mod. You can change the starting name to whatever you want in the Skypatcher ini file. Saves 0.1 seconds on the start of each playthrough (if you use the same name every time).
  
  
You are no Prisoner, you are Dovahkiin!!
  
  
Safe to add/remove whenever, but if it's not installed at game start there's no point really XD
  
  
Enjoy!
