Bethesda can call it a 'fine hat' all they want, its fugly. It's bad enough that you're in front of your favorite daedric prince in a clothing mesh that strongly resembles a bathrobe, the humiliation of also enduring a bald head after downloading all of dint999's SMP hair and watching your graphics card slowly implode in on itself as a result - is an injustice to harsh to bear.
  
  
**What does this mod do?**
  
Literally just removes the 'fine hat' reference from the script that force equips the other fugly clothes on to you. That's it. Consider this the least helpful and most immersive mod on Nexus. Now you can show Sheo your swishy hair while you discover that punching Dervenin will net you a bounty in Haafingar Hold.
  
  
Probably incompatible with any mods that alter the Mind of Madness quest. Compatible with everything else.
