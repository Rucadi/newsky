# Vanilla Eating Animation Fixes

Tiny mod to address a long-standing vanilla annoyance where NPCs don't move their mouths or chew while playing eating animations. Also fixes very low sounds and temporarily disables head tracking while eating, so NPCs don't turn their heads and stare at you like lunatics while chewing. Works with any mod that uses vanilla eating animations but doesn't require them. 
  
  
In the unlikely event Mod authors want to use it to make NPC's chew in their mods, set AnimVarInt "NPCC\_Chew" in your animation.
