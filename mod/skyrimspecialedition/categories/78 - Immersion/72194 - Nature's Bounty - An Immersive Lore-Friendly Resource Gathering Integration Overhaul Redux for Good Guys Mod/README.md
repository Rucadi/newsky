Unlike the mod's title, this mod's scope is relatively simple: quick, clean integration for items that vanilla or the Creation Club implements in a way that could be slightly better or more accessible.
  
  
This is a list of the available mods on this page:**Pheasant Encounters**
  

  
* Adds pheasants to the ambient creature list (the one that spawns rabbits and foxes).
Provides another way to get Pheasant Breast other than only from harvesting already dead ones hanging on racks that someone else went through the effort to track down and kill for their dinner.
  
* Pheasant meshes and textures are from [New Creatures by RoboBirdie](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/94833)﻿.
Patch for Mihail's Pheasant mods (combined, since it makes little sense to use one and not both) [Ring-necked Pheasants](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/95121)﻿ and [Hanging Dead Pheasants Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/94837)﻿.
  

  
**Dreugh Remains**
  

  
* Adds some washed up dreugh parts, presumably from either dead dreugh, or shed when changing from sea to land and/or back again.
Provides some Chitin Plate and a lootable source for Rare Curios' Dreugh Wax.
  
* Uses mesh parts from the [Staves](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Staves_(Creation)) ﻿creation, so that is *required* for this mod to not have missing textures. It should go without saying that Rare Curios is required, since it is the entire reason for this mod.

  
[color=#dd7e6b]**Don't Leave Me Hanging - Plants**[/color]
  
  

  
* Uses [Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805)﻿ (*required*)to swap a small proportion of Mountain Flowers into Garlic, Frost Mirriam or Elves Ear plants.
15% chance for a small Purple Mountain Flower plant to instead be Elves Ear plant
  
* 15% Chance for a small Blue Mountain Flower plant to instead be a Frost Mirriam plant
20% chance for a small Red Mountain Flower plant to instead be a Wild Garlic plant. Garlic Meshes and Textures derived from [Wild Garlic by LadylRayna on Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/wild-garlic-bulrush-borage-medicinal-plants-c060a8f5a2ba4c21a3d4fd99660d94fe)﻿
  

  
**Frostcrag Spire Mana Blooms**
  
  

  
* Adds 2 types of Mana Bloom plant to the garden in Frostcrag Spire in [Beyond Skyrim Bruma](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10917)﻿.
4 Purple Mana Blooms that give Ambrosia
  
* 4 Blue Mana Blooms that give Lichor
These plants cannot be planted elsewhere.
  
* The contents of the garden are initially considered stealing in Bruma, so this also applies to the new plants.
