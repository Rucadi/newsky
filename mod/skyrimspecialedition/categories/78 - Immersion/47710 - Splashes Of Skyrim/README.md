[/size]**Description**
  
  
 ﻿﻿Vanilla game already has water splashes for projectile hits but very limited (depends on the type of projectile and works only on
  
 ﻿some ﻿﻿water activators). This SKSE plugin extends it to all water surfaces, and adds dynamic water ripple displacement.
  
  
 ﻿Following projectile types are supported - missile, arrow, flame, cone, beam with their own unique impact effects for normal, fire
  
 ﻿and ﻿dragon ﻿fire projectiles.
  
  
 ﻿It also adds underwater explosions (unused in vanilla) for fire based explosions (for example, Fireball), or other explosions if
  
 ﻿configured.
  
  
 All effects can be changed/toggled in *po3\_SplashesOfSkyrim.ini.*
  
  
**Notes**
  
  

  
* **﻿**Flame and underwater explosions must have a surface to hit (eg. an underwater rock or surface) to cause impact effects/explosions.
Arrows will occasionally trigger splashes when floating on water.
  
* Splashes will not work in water flagged as dangerous.﻿ This can be toggled in the included config.

  

  
* Missing .ini settings will be automatically added once the game is started.
