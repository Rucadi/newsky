Did you know that the dragon word walls actually had lore and stories of their own? 
  
Dragon Wall Wisdom is a mod that allows you to go up to any word wall and read what is written on it. The text was taken from UESP wiki and teswiki as well as an ingame book called "Dragon Language: Myth no More". Every word wall in Skyrim and from Dawnguard/Dragonborn have been covered.
  
  
This mod is really lightweight and is 100% compatible with all other mods except for those who intentionally change the position of the word walls. This mod is also safe to install/uninstall at any point you wish.
