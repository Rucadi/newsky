**Requirements**
  
  
SKSE64
  
Visual C++ Redistributables 2019 
  
Address Library for SKSE Plugins
  
  
**Description**
  
  

  
* SKSE plugin that cleans blood off armor/weapons when swimming or when raining. Works on the player and NPCs.
While raining, screen blood is disabled and characters will not get bloody.
  

  
 ﻿All of these can be toggled in the included *po3\_WashThatBloodOff.ini.

>
>   
> * Address Library support
> Anniversary Edition support
>   
> * Blood gets washed away in rain
> Affects weapon blood
>   
> * No need for Skyrim.ini tweaks, blood decals are cleaned up properly
>
>   
> Q: Is it compatible with Dirt And Blood? Enhanced Blood?
>   
>   
> Answer: Yes
>   
>   
> Q: But Dirt And Blood does the same thing???
>   
>   
> Answer. No. [i]Dirt And Blood* uses effect shaders to show "fake" blood and dirt on characters. 
  
*Wash That Blood* *Away* deals with actual blood decals on weapons and armor, which the above mod can do nothing about.
  
  
Two different things. [/i]
