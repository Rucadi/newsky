[Immersive Equipment Displays](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62001) is an amazing mod that let's you customize how you can display your equipment.
  
  
With that in mind, I've decided to share some presets that I think are cool.
  
Check the Articles section and drop a comment if you have any doubts.
  
  
For the presets, use version 1.7.3 or above.
  
  
**Presets available:**
  

  
* **Separate nodes**: Presets to separate Greatswords from Battleaxes/Warhammers, Bows from Crossbows and Arrows from Bolts.
**Disable quiver**: Preset to disable the quiver when a bow or crossbow is not equipped/displayed.
  
* **Bard Preset**: Allows your character to showcase instruments (Lute, Flute and Drum). The instruments will not be displayed when performing a song. The displays are repositioned when using a backpack.
    
  To be used with [Bards Reborn Student of Song Become a Bard](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47994) or [Skyrim's Got Talent - Improve As a Bard](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50357).Spoiler![](https://media1.tenor.com/images/0d72a088c42e8ee13e36b64d18742c29/tenor.gif)﻿
**Witcher Preset:** Allows your character to display two greatswords on the back. Weapons will automatically be displayed filtering by the two last greatswords equipped, must be favorited.

**Scabbard for Weapons:** A somewhat band-aid solution that adds scabbards for weapons that don't actually have one. Check this [article](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/4586) on how to use this.

It was made with Campifre backpacks in mind, but should work with other backpack mods, some clippling is expected.If you want to use Bows and Crossbows at the same time, go to "Display manager > Equipment" and select the following nodes for bows and crossbows.Spoiler![](https://i.imgur.com/IqBqWMv.jpg)* **Potions Preset**: Preset for healing, magicka and stamina potions. The displays are disabled when not using armor or when consuming all potions.
