# Better Dynamic Snow 2.11 DE - Seasonal Patch

Adds summer swaps for [Better Dynamic Snow 2.11 - Definitive Edition](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/112386)
  
  
**DESCRIPTION**
  
  
Fantastic All-in-one Better Dynamic Snow 2.11 - Definitive Edition adds snow shaders to many objects in Skyrim. Unfortunately using BOS swaps destroys Unfrozen summer swaps and adds more snowy objects which ends up having snow in the summer. This mod fixes that.
  
  
  
**INSTALLATION**
  
  
**Requirements:**
  
  
- You need to have seasonal framework for this mod to work ([Seasons of Skyrim SKSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62861))  
  
- [Seasonal Landscapes - Unfrozen](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71967)
  
- [Better Dynamic Snow 2.11 - Definitive Edition](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/112386)
  
  
Install with your favourite mod manager. Load order of this patch does not matter.
  
  
**After instalation check if Seasons folder with inis inside had been generated, if not - create one and move inis inside** 
  
(mo2 ignores seasons folder that is in the archive)
  
  
**Windhelm fix was tested with FYX - Palace of The Kings meshes.**
  
  
**Q&A**
  
  
**ESP?**
  
No, just seasonal swap ini.
  
  
**I see some snowy object in the summer...**
  
Please click it with console enabled and send me it's ID. I will check it out. Maybe BDS mod was updated with more swaps and I did not manage to update my seasonal file. Maybe you are using some other mod that requires Unfrozen patch. Or maybe I borked sth ;)
  
  
**Current plans**
  
I am working on Windhelm seasonal overhaul. Unfrozen in the summer, Icy Windhelm in winter and mediocre snowy in the spring/autumn. Need to incorporate BDS shader changes to achieve the best effect.
