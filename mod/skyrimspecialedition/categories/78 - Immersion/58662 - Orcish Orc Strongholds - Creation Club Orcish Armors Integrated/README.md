[/b]This is a very simple mod that will give both the Orcish Plate and Orcish Scaled set from Creation Club to some members of the Orc Strongholds. Further details follow:
  
- Orcish Plate set will replace the lower tiers of Stronghold's leveled item. This means if you enter the Strongholds at early levels, Orcs will be equipped with Orcish Plate set instead of iron or steel, they would still be equipped with vanilla Orcish set if your level is high enough.
  
- Ghorbash and Ugor were given the Orcish Plate set without helmet.
  
- Garakh, Lob, Dushnamub were given the Orcish Scaled set without helmet and gauntlets, similar to how they dressed in vanilla.
  
- Chief Mauhulakh was given a full set of Orcish Scaled.
  
  
The reasoning behind giving the armors to these specific NPCs was simply based on their vanilla equipment: whoever equipped vanilla Scaled set will receive the equivalent Orcish Scaled parts, and Orcish Plate for Steel.
  
  
Currently, this integration only affects Orc Strongholds most, hence its name. I've no plan to integrate it to leveled list as it would be covered by mods like **[Creation Club Integration - Armours](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29020)** which I strongly recommend.
