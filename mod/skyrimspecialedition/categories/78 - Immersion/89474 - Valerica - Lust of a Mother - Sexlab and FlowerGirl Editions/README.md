**Description:**
  
  
This mod adds 714 voiced lines for Valerica. You can beg her for attention, or simply enjoy her campy-yet-immersive comments as you travel together using a follower mod of your choice. Have sex with her in front of Serana, and Serana will even comment her irritation at being passed up for her mother! Offer Valerica a sip of your blood from the goodness of your heart, or ask her to "show you her affection" for a variety of options! Valerica will make some idle comments that are not so...innocent... and she will have comments for when you bump into her. Often times she is derisive of your advances, but you may be fortunate to receive a kind word from her - if the mood strikes.
  
  
There are small prompts for the player when talking to Valerica that open up options that end in a sexual encounter. This is made for a male player in mind...particularly if you have always wanted to simp for this pretty vampire mommy. She may not be Lady Dimitrescu...but she's the next best thing. You will not be disappointed! There are plenty of generic lines that can make sense for a non-male character, but there are some that are clearly directed towards a male.
  
  
This mod is voiced using the amazing Elevenlabs program. The voice is 100% original now! I created all of the dialogue, which was then scripted and put together by the hard work of [shadowman2777](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/139369873). Check out his content if you like what you see here! Sexlab and Flower Girl editions require their respective mods to engage in sexual activity.
  
  
**INSTALLATION:** To be safe and avoid any wonky business, do not install until after you have completed Dawnguard and Valerica is back in her laboratory at the castle. When defeating Harkon, you can go back to the Soul Cairn and tell Valerica, and she will move back to her laboratory after a few hours.
  
  
**Disclaimer**: ***This mod does not add sex to the game*.** It only adds dialogue to enhance immersion, and is an homage to this glorious character and the talent that created her.
  
  
**Addendum:** Due to the actions of the reddit community, I have unfortunately had to take down the (original) voiced versions of this mod in order to allow it to remain on the nexus. I have found a generic voice which sounds surprisingly similar (after modulating) to the original VA for Valerica. This voice will not be controversial due to it being from a different generic voice, and modulated several times, making it unique and without any ties to a real person. The only downside is the accent is a little different, and it makes her sound a few years younger. However, with its similarity I think it will provide for a problem-free option for players to enjoy all of this content with a believable voice without danger of removal. If other mods of mine have a similar fate, then I will just replace them with other modulated risk-free voices as well (I may end up doing this anyway). Thanks for your support!
  
  
**Frequently Asked Questions:**
  
  
**Question:** Your mod is flagged as conflicting with such-and-such of your other mods
  
  
**Answer:** Yes, that is because my other mods still use the same scripts. They overwrite each other and work fine, nothing to worry about.
  
  
**Question:** Does your mod work with Serana Dialogue, Amorous Adventures, Etc.
  
  
**Answer:** Yes, my mod works with all dialogue mods to my knowledge. The only time my mod will conflict is if a mod changes the npc folder names of the vanilla characters.
  
  
**Question:** Ostim version?
  
  
**Answer:** SimonPhil was given permission and has created a compendium of patches for my mods: ( https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89727)
  
  
**Question:** I'm reporting a bug (animations not working, lines not triggering, etc.)
  
  
**Answer:** I am happy to troubleshoot, but I need to know what animation mod you are using (Slab, FG, Ostim, or if multiple), and what version you are using (make sure you have the latest version installed!), make sure you have the correct edition for the animation mod that you use (FG edition does not work with Slab framework).

If you want Valerica as a follower, you will need to use one of the many follower mods available. Personally, I really like Relationship Dialogue Overhaul by cloudedtruth (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1187)
  
  
**P.S.** if you want your Valerica to look like mine, I use the 3BA body, porcelain skin texture, KS hairdo wigs, and other mods mentioned under credits. I included my personal bodyslide of her in the optional files section.
  
  
**1.23 Update 10/23/2023:**Lots of new features including poses, asking Valerica (and Serana) for a kiss, offering your neck to Serana for a quick drink, and several new lines for both characters. This mod remains unvoiced, but soon I will be uploading a new, uncontroversial voiced version hopefully in the next few weeks.
  
  
**Update 2/17/24** - Had to take a break because of some unrelated stuff. I'm back on track now, currently at line 488 out of 755 voicelines. I will see if I can finish it and its versions sometime this week.
  
  
**Update 2/21/24** - Finally got the lines generated! I ran out of characters (A ton of voiced lines to generate!), so I plan to include any voicelines that I missed in this release to add in my next update which will also include a voice for Serana, as well as potentially replacing the original game lines for Valerica so the voice is more consistent. The voice isn't perfected to the quality I would like, so I will be working on trying to improve some of the scratchiness of it. If any of you are good at improving sound quality through a program like Audacity, you can PM me and I'd be happy to work together. This new voiced version is optional, and you can always stick with the silent version if you are not a fan of the replacement. The lip sync files were also not generated from scratch, so some of the mouth movement will be off. I will also be regenerating those in the next update as well.
