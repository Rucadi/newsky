Elda Early-Dawn will now decline to rent a room at Candlehearth Hall to you if you are playing as a Dark Elf. If you need a place to stay in Windhelm, Ambarys Rendar at the New Gnisis Cornerclub is willing to rent you the bed upstairs (where Malthyr Elenil usually sleeps).
  
  
Nils is not affected, so if something were to happen to Elda and Nils would take over, it will be available to Dark Elves as normal.
  
  
If Malthyr has to take over for Ambarys, he will continue to offer the bed rental service to Dark Elves.
