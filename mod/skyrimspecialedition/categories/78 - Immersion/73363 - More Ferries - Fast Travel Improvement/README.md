**More Ferries**﻿

  
﻿
  
A mod that expands the ferrymen dialogue options from the Dawnguard DLC, adding new destinations, ferrymen and changes on prices. This mod doesn't try to be realistic as CFTO, so you can travel to other destinations using any ferrymen. I wanted to add some options not shared with the carriage system, so it's more useful.
  
  
**Features**

  
* New Ferrymen in Morthal, Riften, Northwatch, Winterhold, Ilinalta Lake and ﻿Dayspring Canyon.
New Ferrymen in Raven Rock, Tel Mithryn and Skaal Village.
  
  
* New prices for ferry services (75 for cities or towns, 125 to extra places and 350 for dangerous places).
New order for dialogue options.
  
* Access to Dawnguard option without starting the Dawnguard questline.
Increased prices for sailing to Solstheim.
  
* Adds lanterns on all ferrymen's boats.﻿
Flagged as esl.
  

  
**Note**: The new prices require a new game to show up.
  
  
This mod is a complement for my other mod [More Carriages](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71135)﻿, that expand the carriage system.
  
  
The appearance and name of the ferrymen was based on Ferrymen from Carriage and Ferry Travel Overhaul and some unused NPCs.
