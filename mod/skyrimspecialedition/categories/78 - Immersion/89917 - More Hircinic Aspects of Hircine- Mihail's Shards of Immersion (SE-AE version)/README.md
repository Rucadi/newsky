By projecting himself in the form of the ghost of the recently killed White Stag, or in the spectral form of Sinding, in case you decide to kill him, Hircine represents his dominance over prey and predator, showing the player his absolute control over the Hunt. The spectral projections do not directly represent the soul of the White Stag or Sinding, but Hircine's power, control and influence over them and over everything that affects those connected to him. Therefore, I decided to give that extra touch, in an immersive and logical way, to these apparitions, maintaining the original meaning, being possible to clearly see that they are the projections of the White Stag and Sinding, but under the command of the consciousness and aura of Hircine .
  
  
I also recommend my Sinding's Werewolf Voice Overhaul ([LE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/115142)﻿-[SE/AE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/88230)﻿) for an even more immersive experience on the Hircine's questline.*

The mod is not compatible with other mods that modify the 2 vanilla Aspects of Hircine. If you have one installed, or think you might have one, put this mod below it/them in your load order. If you are asked about files overwriting those of other mods, press "Yes to all".
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Shards of Immersion saga brings small elements that add a touch of immersion and realism to the fantastic world of Skyrim, making it even more alive and dynamic, which seems to exist beyond the adventure of the Dragonborn.
