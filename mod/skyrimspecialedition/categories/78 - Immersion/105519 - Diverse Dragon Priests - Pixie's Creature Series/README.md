**OVERVIEW**
  
  
Diverse Dragon Priests **massively improves upon the visual quality and variety of Dragon Priests**, adding **35 new variants** all with **custom models & HQ 4K textures**, optimized in BC7 for best quality and performance. The main file is .esl-flagged and will not take up a slot in your load order.
  
  
The new models have a ton of visual variety, including **diverse body shapes**, **sexual dimorphism between male and female Dragon Priests and Priestesses** (Priestesses will have more of a slender frame, smaller shoulders, wider hip bones, smaller hands and feet, etc. and males will range between normal Dragon Priest size and larger-framed armored Priests), and **unique textures for each elemental specialization** (Fire, Frost, and Storm)
  
  
These new variants are added to the leveled lists and will appear alongside vanilla Dragon Priests, which means they are **compatible with and can be used alongside any other Dragon Priest retexture, replacer, etc.** and will not affect game balance or alter vanilla records.
  
  
  
**IN THE OPTIONAL FILES** there are also two options to replace vanilla Dragon Priests with the ones from Diverse Dragon Priests: **Vanilla Replacer LITE [color=#ffffff]- Texture-only replacer that allows vanilla Dragon Priests to use the high quality 4K base textures from DDP, no variation between vanilla elemental priests as the vanilla Dragon Priests all use the same texture path in the base game**Vanilla Replacer FULL[/color] **(Recommended) - Allows vanilla Dragon Priests to utilize all of the elemental textures from DDP, creating greater variety in appearance and synergy with their elemental focus.
  
  
COMPATIBILITY AND FAQ**
  
**[DIVERSE DRAGON PRIESTS PATCH HUB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/105584)﻿**

  

The main file doesn't touch \*any\* vanilla records other than adding the new variants to the Dragon Priest leveled lists, and is therefore compatible with anything other than mods that also alter those leveled lists, in which case a bashed patch will be required.
  
  
The Vanilla Replacer FULL version only alters the template Dragon Priests to allow them to use the various elemental textures from DDP, and may need patching for mods that directly edit those templates.
  
  
Unique named Dragon Priests WILL benefit from both Vanilla Replacer versions, but their masks are **NOT AFFECTED AT ALL** by any version to ensure that you can continue to use your favorite Dragon Priest mask replacers alongside Diverse Dragon Priests with no issue.
