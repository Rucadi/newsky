# Diverse Chicken Coops - Base Object Swapper

Chickens, they've got it pretty rough in Skyrim, huh? First, they have to lay eggs almost the size of themselves, and then they're just left outside for the foxes to eat. Well, not anymore. This mod adds seventeen different chicken coops throughout Skyrim. Some are based on real-world examples (check out the gallery for more).
  
  
The mod uses Base Object Swapper to place all the hen houses and so there are no world edits in the ESL flagged esp. This means it's easy to edit the SWAP file to remove any hen houses you don't like or that clash with other mods you may be using. The SWAP file already contains patch edits for JK's Riften Overhaul and Mihail's Haystacks, as I use both those mods. These edits won't affect your game if you don't use these mods.
  
  
The mod is compatible with any mod that retextures the nests. You can use Kanj's nests overhaul, but the meshes from that mod are slightly larger than vanilla, and so some clipping may occur. I've made my own nest overhaul, which I will upload soon.
  
  
Installation: 
  
  
1) Download and install [Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805). Endorse that mod! BOS handles the distribution and placement of the hen houses.
  
2b) Optional but highly recommended. Install [Rudy HQ - Hay SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25125).
  
3) Install [High Quality Ivy Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/113578) (it's required for the coops with ivy on them).
  
3) Install this mod. If you use some of my other mods, you may be asked to overwrite them. That's all good, as these are just repeat textures. 
  
4) Enjoy!

Some meshes for hay are from Rudy's [Rudy HQ - Hay SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25125). Thanks so much for allowing your assets to be used in mods like this. While [Rudy HQ - Hay SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25125) isn't a hard requirement for this mod, I highly recommend using it. 
  
  
The mod makes use of a texture from [Bucket Enrichment by gooball60](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81601). I highly recommend using Gooball60's mod. Thanks so much to [gooball60](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/10157062) for allowing their assets to be used in mods like this one. Please give them some kudos! 
  
  
The wicker was created using assets from [KG's Fences](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/79126). Thanks so much to [Kiddgimmick](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/6309911) for allowing their assets to be used in mods such as this one.
  
  
Compatibility
  
  
I'm looking at patching some of the farm and town overhauls available that move chicken nests around. It's unlikely that I'll patch Ryn's Farms as they add their own coops. 
  
  
Currently, JK's Riften Outskirts and Mihail's Haystacks are supported in the main file. The Great Town of Shor's Stone patch is available in the Optional Files section.
