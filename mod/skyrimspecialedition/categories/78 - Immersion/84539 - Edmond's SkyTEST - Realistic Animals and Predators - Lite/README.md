SkyTEST - Realistic Animals and Predators - Lite

  
  
  
  
Description
  
This mod is stand alone and does not require the original mod to work. The mod itself is only a .esp and a couple sound files so it can be installed and uninstalled at any time. This is a light weight alternative to SkyTEST and includes all of the benefits of sky test to include improved animal behavior and AI but nixes additional features like additionally placed animals, world edits, or new animals, etc. This is a highly compatible version of SkyTEST and only includes edits to vanilla animals. I have also gone through the entire bugs tab of the original SkyTEST mod and fixed all of the bugs as well to include the rag-doll CTD bug and wolf faction infighting bug +others.

Whats Included
  
This is a simple mod that does a simple thing. Animals in skryim will search for water during the day, will forage for food, and will hunt. They fear fire, and predators will hunt in a pack attempting to wear their pray down. Additionally due to the faction system predators will not attack in tandem so you wont get saber cats and wolves teaming up against you. They are as likely to attack each other as they are to attack you.
  
  
As of version 3.5 the mod now is offered in ESL in addition to ESP as well.
  
  
  
Compatibility
  
As stated previously this mod is highly compatible and is based on the original most recent version of SkyTEST. That said everything the original SkyTEST is compatible with this mod is compatible with as well, and it should honestly be more compatible then the original. I have open permissions to make patches to this mod if any are required no need to ask just make sure they require this mod to work because I will be updating/supporting this mod.
  
  
Note: Because this mod is now ESL you must remove all previous SkyTEST patches that you were using and only use the patches hosted on this mod page or patches that specifically state that they are for the .ESL version of this mod.
