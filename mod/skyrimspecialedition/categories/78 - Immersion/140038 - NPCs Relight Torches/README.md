**Description:**
  
After the release of skyrim, Bethesda Game Studios put out a video of the work they created during their Game Jam. One nifty inclusion was a bandit relighting a removable torch. This mod adds that in. I didn't want followers to be lighting torches when they should be paying attention so at present only bandits, forsworn, guards and soldiers will do the relight.
  
  
  
  
**Compatibility:**
  
The mod required some edits to RemovableTorchSconce01SCRIPT. All the USSEP fixes in the script have been carried forward without requiring USSEP as a master.
  
  
**Features:**
  
- ESP file flagged as ESL
  
- USSEP fixes carried forward, not required as a master.
  
- Plug and Play. Requires no additional setting up or mods
  
  
**Known Issues:**- None
