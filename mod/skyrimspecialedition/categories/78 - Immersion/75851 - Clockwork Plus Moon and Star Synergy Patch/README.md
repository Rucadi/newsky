In Moon and Star, the Ancient Dwemer Tome found in Kagrenar can be taken to [REDACTED] to be translated, however it's usually some time before I get up around that area, so it just felt odd for my Dragonborn to be selectively stupid, carrying the book around with him for that whole time until then, all the while living with the Dwemer and not once thinking to ask them to translate it.
  
  
So I made this. I carefully spliced Lamashtu's dialogue from Clockwork to make her responses.
  
  
I *think* if you pick the "bad ending" of Moon and Star, you can't translate the book at all, so this could also be a new option for all you villains.
  
  
Simply speak to Lamashtu with the book in your inventory any time after she's more "forthcoming" and ask her to translate it. After 24 hours, she'll be finished with it.
  
  
Flagged as ESL. Let me know if there's any issues.
