Adds seasonal swaps for Snowy Ships for Snowy Regions
  
  
**DESCRIPTION**
  
  
ToosTruus created great Snowy Ships for Snowy Regions mod. However when using Unfrozen seasonal setup we don't have snow in the summer even far north, but we have it everywhere in the winter, so default swaps don't fit how location looks.
  
  
I am working on Seasonal Project for Lexy's Guide and decided to add seasonal modifications that fits Unfrozen seasonal build:
  
- In Winter - EVERY ship/boat is covered in snow.
  
- In Spring/Autumn - default
  
- In the Summer - EVERY ship/boat is free of snow
  
  
If you don't use Unfrozen, just delete summer ini. 
  
  
  
**INSTALLATION**
  
  
**Requirements:**
  
  
- You need to have seasonal framework for this mod to work ([Seasons of Skyrim SKSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62861))  
  
- [Snowy Ships for Snowy Regions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/111827) with it's requirement
  
  
Install with your favourite mod manager. Load order of this patch does not matter.
  
  
**After instalation check if Seasons folder with inis inside had been generated, if not - create one and move inis inside** 
  
(mo2 ignores seasons folder that is in the archive)
  
**Q&A**
  
**ESP?**
  
No. Just seasonal swaps ini files (for main mod). ESL flagged esp for optional patches
  
  
**Snowy Ships for Snowy Regions mod had an update. Will seasonal patch work with new version?**
  
Usually yes it will. Toostruus adds more swaps with every update, but seasonal swaps are based on swapping static object so it would work with adding new locations as well. If new snowy statics are being added I would have to add them to seasonal patch as well for them to change with seasons.
