My Goal
  
  
I love The Elder Scrolls series dearly, and I want to make my favorite game feel better for everyone. 
  
There are many other modders who do amazing things, and I feel like as a group we can make Skyrim feel new in EVERY way. 
  
My goal is to update many of the game's exteriors and/or interiors of commonly visited dungeons throughout Skyrim, all marked as ESL to leave more room for more mods.
  
Please feel free to leave suggestions along the way! ﻿

Valtheim Towers
  
  
The Valtheim Towers are located in a key roadway between Eastern and Western Skyrim, taken over by bandits.
  
The location surely would need to be defendable to push off Whiterun guards and either warring factions that may try to take it for themselves, so why is it so empty and barren? How can these bandits keep a foothold in such a key location? 
  
I've decided to fix this. Valtheim Towers is far expanded and made much more a defensively advantageous location.
