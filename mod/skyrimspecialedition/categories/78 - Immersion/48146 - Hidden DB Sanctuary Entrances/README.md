***﻿Hidden DB Sanctuary Entrances***

  
First, credit goes to [KainRo](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/22464639) ﻿for the idea.
  
  
The Dark Brotherhood  was supposed to be a secret group of assassins, so why could everyone find their Sanctuary, while taking a walk at the beach from Dawnstar or in the forest of Falkreath?
  
  
This mod fixes this in an immersive way. Sadly [KainRo](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/22464639)'s mod has some issues, mainly because he makes it so that you have to walk through an additional cell (Mine). For this to work he moves the original door which leads to some issues, where u can no longer open the door in some occasions.
  
  
My mod don't move the doors but hides them in an immersive way, worthy of a secret society of assassins.

[font=Arial]Locations: Dawnstar Sanctuary
  
  
In Vanilla everyone can just see the door walking by while fishing? Very Suspicious...
  
With this mod the door is hidden in an old fishing shack. Nothing suspicious here, just don't look in the locked cabinet.
  
  
Spoiler Key is hidden inside a barrel. 
  
  
  
[/font][font=Arial]Locations: Falkreath Sanctuary
  
  
In Vanilla this location is much better hidden than Dawnstar, but still some random hunter could stumble upon the secret door[/font]**[b].**[/b]With this mod the door is hidden behind a stone door**[b],** [/b]just have to find the secret button**[b]**[/b]
  
[font=Arial]Spoiler That stone on the right looks suspicious (hidden activator). 
  
  
  
Bonus as of Version 1.0.2:
  
  
As an added Bonus this mod now disables NPCs commenting about the door, because it is hidden

Should be compatible with all mods, I made sure that all edits are only done in the two cells Dawnstar Sanctuary Exterior, and Sanctuary Exterior.
  
These cells normally get much change anyways, in my load order with a couple of hundred mods I didn't find anything conflicting.
