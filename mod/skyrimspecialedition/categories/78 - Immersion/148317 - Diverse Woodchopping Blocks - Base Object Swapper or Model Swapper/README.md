Hi everyone!
  
  
This mod is a continuation of the work I started doing with my last mod [Lumbermill Log Pile FIX](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/147305). I set out to make a bit more sense of how the larger logs are broken down into firewood: what the process would be, what the stages are. When I began looking at the chopping block, I noticed that there were some UV errors (see the gallery). And then I noticed something pretty odd: when someone chops a log in Skyrim, it splits in half only to land in a big pile of quarter logs! I understand why this was done (the quarter model is the final firewood model), but it's so jarring that I decided I had to fix it. You'll now see lots of half logs on the chopped wood piles. You'll also see aspen firewood in The Rift.
  
  
In total, there are thirty-one variants (including the aspen piles) distributed randomly around Skyrim. This includes four variant chopping blocks, each with four or five variants of the wood piles that surround them. All of the assets are sourced from Happy Little Trees, and so none of the blocks should seem out of place.
