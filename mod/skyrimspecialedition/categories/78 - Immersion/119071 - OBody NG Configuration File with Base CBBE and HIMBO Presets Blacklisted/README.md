OBody NG will use any presets you have installed including the ones that come with CBBE, HIMBO and TNG. This mod prevents those presets from being given to NPCs so that you have more control over what presets end up in game.
  
  
If you are trying to use this on an existing save, you must click the option in the MCM to reset all distributed presets in order for this to have any effect.
  
  
There is also an optional version which removes the race blacklists that prevent any presets from being distributed to ElderRace. This means that the elders will use the same presets as everyone else.
