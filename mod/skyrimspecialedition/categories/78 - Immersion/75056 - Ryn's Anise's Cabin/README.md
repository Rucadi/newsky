Ryn's Anise's Cabin
  
  
A very minor location in Skyrim, with an interesting short story to go along with it, Anise's Cabin is a fun experience for the first-time player.
  
While the story is barely fleshed-out, the location is somehow even less detailed. There is little to set it apart visually from the rest of the game's shacks spread across the region.
  
And that's just what Anise's *"cabin"* was- a shack with holes in the walls and roof, totally unkept. Don't you think if she is planning a coven to form in her quaint home, she would keep the place a bit more solid? And that she would actually have room for another person to join her here?
  
And again, if she is going to farm, shouldn't she be farming more than 3 potatoes, 3 cabbages, and a few leaks? That just isn't realistic or sustainable.
  
All of this has been improved upon, without touching her ***chamber of secrets.***
