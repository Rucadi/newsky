[left]**OStim Improved Camera Configuration**[/left]
  
This is a configuration file for *Improved Camera* that is optimized for *OStim* scenes.
  
[Open Animations Romance and Erotica](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98732)﻿ and [Open Animations 3P Plus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/116829)﻿ are the only animation sets that contain animations designed for first person with *Improved Camera*. Therefore, it is recommended that you use this configuration with them.
  
Notice: *OStim Standalone* comes with a configuration for *Improved Camera* by default. I set the values for the original file, but I can no longer update it. The values have changed with Improved Camera updates, so I recommend that you use this instead.
  
  
  
**Installation**
  

  
1. Install [Improved Camera](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93962)﻿﻿;
Install this file;
  
2. Load after *OStim Standalone*;
Depending on the *fomod* option that you choose, it may **overwrite** the default configuration file from *Improved Camera*. If you choose this option, make sure to load it after *Improved Camera*.
  
3. If you choose **not to overwrite**, in game you must press *Left Shift + Home > Profiles > select OStim*.

  
**How to use**
  

  
* During OStim scenes, press **Numpad /** or the equivalent to go into first person.
If that does not work, try using the **mouse scroll wheel**.
  

  
**Recommendations**
  

  
* The following are animation sets that feature animations designed for first person:
[Open Animations Romance and Erotica](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98732);
  
* [Open Animations 3P Plus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/116829)﻿.

  
**Troubleshooting**
  
  
If you run into **transparent body** issues with Improved Camera:  if you use *SSE Display Tweaks*, set both **DisableActorFade** and **DisablePlayerFade** to true in the SSE Display Tweaks .ini file. While this adjustment may occasionally distort your perspective—particularly if part of your character crosses the camera—it effectively prevents the transparency issue.
