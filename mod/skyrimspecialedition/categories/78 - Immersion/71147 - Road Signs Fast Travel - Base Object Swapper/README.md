**Road Signs Fast Travel - Base Object Swapper**This is a mod based on [Road Signs Fast Travel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/90843), it replaces all road signs using Base Object Swapper with activators that you can use to travel to the place that show up in the selected sign.
  
  
**Features**

  
* Travel to multiples places using road signs.
Configurable gold cost based on distance.
  
* Travel Kit requirement to travel.
Survival restrictions when Freezing, hungry, thirsty, tired and injured.
  
* New shortcuts for some places.
Persistent settings using [MCM Helper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53000)﻿.
  
* Everything can be disabled using the MCM.
Flagged as ESL.
  

  
The Travel Kit can be crafted at any cookpit with ale or alto wine, cooked beef or baked potatoes, bread and firewood and is required to travel if the feature is enabled.
  
  
**Combatibility**
  
Road Signs Fast Travel is compatible with any mod that add new vanilla signs. Mods that add new custom signs will need a patch. Native compatibility included for [Point The Way](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/352)﻿, [Lux Via](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63588)﻿ and ﻿[Weathered Roadsigns](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10180)﻿.
  
  
The survival restrictions will restrict only for the two worse states of any enabled need. This feature only works for [SunHelm](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39414) and Survival Mode. It can be used with mods that alter Survival Mode like [Survival Mode Improved](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78244) and [Starfrost](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97536). The injury restriction requires [Blade and Blunt](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34549).
  
  
It's recommended to use it with mods that adds more road signs like [Point the Way](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/352)﻿, [Lux Via](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63588) or [Waymark](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53333)﻿.
