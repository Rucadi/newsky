Littie Library adds additional flavor and recreational reading to Skyrim by introducing a selection of new books, written by me. Currently the mod adds **50** new books to Skyrim. They cover a range of genres and are by different fictional authors, with care taken to be consistent with TES lore. Most of the books are standalone, but some are series, and some extend existing series from the vanilla game.
  
  
I was inspired to create this mod after making [Little Lessons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/126582) and realizing Herbane's Bestiary had only three entries in it. A desire to expand on that sparked this idea. I'm already a real-life writer (you can find out more on my profile) and thought it would be fun to take up the challenge of writing lots of short stories in different voices.
  
  
[Leveled List Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/132765) is strongly recommended because it's used to distribute the books to leveled lists, but for those who can't/won't use it, there's a patch to add the books manually (see **Compatibility** below). Several other framework mods are used for distributing to NPCs and some containers, as well as integrating with other mods; these are optional, but encouraged for the best experience. (See the **Frameworks Used** section below.)
  
  
What you'll find in this collection includes:
  
  

  
* Fictional stories: drama, romance, comedy, adventure, slice of life
Personal accounts of real\* events
  
* Travelogues
History
  
* Religious and political writing\*
Instructional texts
  
* Stage plays†
Cookbooks†
  
* Poetry
Familiar faces and Easter eggs
  

\* In-game, obviously
  
† Only one so far
  
  
Some of the books have been marked as good gifts for children, and the rare books are integrated into the "Fetch Me That Book!" radiant quest.
  
  
[font=Fondamento,Georgia,serif]**New Series**[/font]
  
  

  
* **Robindric the Sailor**: The heroic adventures of a Breton sailor and the crew of his good ship the Larimarine, loosely inspired by Sinbad. The books are meant to appeal to all ages, in-game and hopefully out.
**Sagas of Malacath's Wizard**: Stories of Muraug, an itinerant Orc mage specializing in alteration, who practices his own interpretation of the Code of Malacath by helping others who show strength of their own. He's joined by his Nord companion Thuleif Sleet-Shield, who documents their travels in a Holmes/Watson dynamic.
  

  
  
[font=Fondamento,Georgia,serif]**Extended Series**[/font]
  
  

  
* **Herbane's Bestiary**: The braggadocious monster hunter's adventures continue in two new books, for a total of five.
**Walking the World**: Implied to be at least an 11-book series in vanilla but we see only one, Spatior Munius now travels to Markarth as well.
  

  
  
[font=Fondamento,Georgia,serif]**Where to Find New Books**[/font]
  
  
You'll find these books anywhere that books are distributed via leveled lists: looted from enemies who are known to carry books, in vendor inventories if they sell books, Apocrypha (obviously), etc. Some locations have "dummy" books populated at random, which can include anything in this collection of common rarity or below. [Solitude Weaver's Lane](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/119955) is a recommended mod for its added bookstore, and [Books of Skyrim SE - Reimagined](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46991) has a patch for this mod.
  
  
Some of the books have been distributed to NPCs, or occasionally containers that they own.
  
  
Using Base Object Swapper, some books replace way-too-common vanilla books, especially in locations where multiple copies of the same vanilla books exist. There are many locations to cover, so this is a slow process but I'm gradually increasing the distribution.

[font=Fondamento,Georgia,serif]**Compatibility**[/font]
  
  
Because Little Library relies on frameworks to do its heavy lifting, it should be compatible with basically everything. No cell edits were made. No objects are placed into the world in a way that would require patch plugins.
  
  
However, a no-LLOS patch file has now been included for users who don't use Leveled List Object Swapper. Since LLOS is fairly new, it hasn't yet been integrated into some big mod lists. Hopefully the big lists will see the value of it as more mods use it. The no-LLOS patch file forwards minor changes made by USSEP to some vanilla lists, but it doesn't require USSEP. Since this patch directly alters leveled lists in a plugin file, it will be incompatible with other book mods' plugins that touch those same lists. I don't have plans to post specific patches between Little Library and other book mods for this, since the point in using LLOS in the first place was to avoid the need for such patches, but users who wish to make their own patches and share them can do so.
  
  
[font=Fondamento,Georgia,serif]**Frameworks Used**[/font]
  
  
For the best experience, the following framework plugins are recommended:
  
  

  
* [Leveled List Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/132765) is required for distributing books via leveled lists so they show up in the world, unless you use the optional no-LLOS patch. If you use that patch, you'll have to manually patch any other book mods that also alter those leveled lists.
[FormList Manipulator](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74037) adds the books to several formlists in the game, and makes some of the books work as gifts for children.
  
* [Spell Perk Item Distributor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869) is used to distribute books to some NPCs.
[Keyword Item Distributor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55728) acts as a modder's resource and also helps with integration for some other mods.
  
* [Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805) handles regional variations on one of the books that has Talos and non-Talos versions.
[Container Distribution Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120152) distributes books to some containers.
  
* [SkyPatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106659) is currently used for integration with some other mods, and its use will undoubtedly be expanded in the future.

  
[font=Fondamento,Georgia,serif]**Integration with Other Mods**[/font]
  
  
Of course as a book lover you'll want these books to work in tandem with other mods that improve the book experience!
  
  

  
* [Little Lessons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/126582): The new entries in Herbane's Bestiary integrate with the mod.
[The Dragonborn's Bestiary](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/123521): Several books that mention creatures will trigger bestiary entries for those creatures to appear. Requires Keyword Item Distributor. (This also covers [Quest and Boss mod Patch Compendium AIO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/138248), [The Thrassian Scare](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/128893), and [The Dragonborn's Fishiary](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/134739).)
  
* [The Great Book Hunt](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/144339): Little Library books will appear in the Book of Books. Requires SkyPatcher.
[Missives - Voice and Quest Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/166094): The new book quest automatically includes Little Library books if you use LLOS, but there's a no-LLOS patch available in optional files if you don't.
  

  
Mods that have incorporated their own patches or support for Little Library:

[font=Fondamento,Georgia,serif]**Developer Features**[/font]
  
  
Several parts of the mod have been prepared as modder resources for people who want to patch it or expand the distribution of books in their own work. These include:
  
  

  
* Keywords for all books added by the mod, and for its new series
Formlists and leveled lists for new series
  
* Leveled lists by rarity for new books
File for distributing keywords via [KID](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55728)
  

  
If you're a mod author who wants to further integrate Little Library in your mod, and would find additional modder resources useful, let me know how I can help. If you create a patch yourself, please pass along the news so it can be listed!
  
  
[font=Fondamento,Georgia,serif]**FAQ**[/font]
  
  
**Q:** ESP-FE?
  
**A:** Naturally.
  
  
**Q:** Will more books be added in the future?
  
**A:** YES! And suggestions are encouraged.
  
  
**Q:** How do you feel about translations?
  
**A:** I leave permissions fairly open on my mods and encourage translations. I'm available to answer any questions as to the intended meanings of any words or phrases in the original works for better translation.
  
  
**Q:** Will there be a patch for [Scribes of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50008)?
  
**A:** Some work has been done on a patch, but it's incomplete and somewhat limited by the available fonts. I'd also prefer if it could be done via [Dynamic String Distributor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/107676) so it could be minimally invasive, but I'm waiting on future features.
  
  
**Q:** Will there be custom covers like in [Book Covers Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/901) / [SkyPatched](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/109254)?
  
**A:** That would be pretty awesome. I'm not a texture creator, though, so that will have to be the work of others.
  
  
**Q:** [Voiced Books of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/94436) addon?
  
**A:** Narrators, have at it!
  
  
**Q:** Why isn't SkyPatcher used for more parts of the mod?
  
**A:** I'm a huge Skypatcher fan, but it currently has a limitation impacting leveled list injection that causes it to skip the very important LItemBookClutter list. If this limitation is changed in the future, future versions of this mod will have a SkyPatcher alternative. I may, at some point, add a SkyPatcher alternative for the FLM file.
  
  
**Q:** Can we get a version that doesn't require those framework mods?
  
**A:** Possibly for some of them. I know I'll need to make one if an Xbox port is ever considered. (There won't be a PlayStation port because of Sony's stupid, stupid no-assets rule.) There is a patch for the leveled lists for users without LLOS. I may add separate patches for formlists and such in the future.
