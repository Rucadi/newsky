**Description**
  
  
Certain dialogue by NPCs in Vanilla wasn't consistent with actual gameplay.
  
  
The following cases were adressed:
  
  

  
* [Ingun Black-Briar](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ingun_Black-Briar): She mentions that Nirnroot does not grow back, while in fact, it does. I removed her mentioning it: *"Nirnroot is the easiest. It grows only by the water and makes a unique chiming noise. ~~The only drawback is it won't regrow after harvesting.~~"*
[Wuunferth the Unliving](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Wuunferth_the_Unliving):
  

  
1. He mentions being part of the College of Winterhold and that they do not allow necromancy, while several NPCs in the College contradict this: *Necromancy? ~~I am a member of the [College of Winterhold](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:College_of_Winterhold_(faction)), in good standing!~~  Come now. ~~They~~ We haven't allowed necromancy for hundreds of years!"*
He also says that the necromancers amulet once depicted a skull, while in fact, it still does: *I know it well. Or at least, I've heard of it. ~~I would wager that carving once depicted a skull.~~ That is the [Necromancer's Amulet](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Necromancer%27s_Amulet), of legend. It appears you were at least half-right. There is necromancy at the heart of this."*
  

  

  
* [Hadvar](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Hadvar) ﻿and [Ralof](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ralof) ﻿both mention: "It's probably best if we split up." Looking at what they say later, this line didn't make much sense, so I disabled the line.
During the intro scene in Helgen, the Imperial Captain will shout out: "Sentries, what do you see?" right after Alduin has landed front and center on the main tower. This didn't make sense, so I disabled the line. In addition, I disabled the line: "It's in the clouds!"
  
* During the Thieves' Guild questline, you will have an option to bribe, intimidate and persuade [Gulum-Ei](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Gulum-Ei)﻿. If you chose the bribe option, you'll be asked to steal Firebrand Wine. However, after the quest, Gulum-Ei will ask for more Firebrand Wine after the quest, even if the player never took the bribe option. As such, I added a condition so these lines will only appear if you took the bribe route.
[Brynjolf](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Brynjolf): During the [Pursuit](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Pursuit), when the Thieves Guild members investigate the Vault, he will use a religious saying, despite later on when becoming a Nightingale, Brynjolf says: "*I'm no priest and I'm certainly not religious.*" As such, I changed his line at the vault to: "*~~By the Eight!~~* *Damn it!* *It's gone, everything's gone! Get in here, all of you!*" 
  
* [Vex](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Vex): During the [Pursuit](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Pursuit), when the Thieves Guild members investigate the Vault, will say: "*~~That door has the best puzzle locks money can buy. There's no way it can be picked open.~~*" Given puzzle locks are a joke in Skyrim, I disabled that line.
[Karliah](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Karliah): During [Trinity Restored](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Trinity_Restored), when talking to her outside [Nighingale Hall](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Nightingale_Hall), the player will at some point has only one option for a dialogue line, namely: "*I have my skill, not powers or magic*." Given the player can be a mage or does use powers at this point, I changed the line to "*I have my own ways of working. Why would I need Nocturnal?*" In addition, I removed several of Karliah's lines that claim that Nocturnal isn't being actively worshipped. As mentioned in [Nystrom's Journal](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Nystrom%27s_Journal) in the Twilight Sepulcher, there are in fact priests of Nocturnal. Karliah should know this, as a Nightingale. Which she does in fact, when she later says: "*Even though Nocturnal doesn't desire worship in the traditional sense, the Twilight Sepulcher propagated a small group of priests. Of course, they'd never come into direct contact with Nocturnal but they insisted they had her favor. As part of their "duties," the priests created all sorts of baseless rituals and ceremonies all on Nocturnal's behalf.*"
  
* [Sibbi Black-Briar](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Sibbi_Black-Briar): When confronting him in Riften jail and asking him if he got arrested for murder, he'll mention that he has to be in jail for 8 months. Since a playthrough can last longer than 8 ingame months, with Sibbi still be in jail, I changed the line to: *"Exactly! And now I have to stare at these bars for ~~eight~~ months. Can you believe it?"* The player has a response on this, which I also changed: *You're serving only ~~eight~~ several months for murder?*
The [Old Orc](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Old_Orc): When he got close to death, he would say "I submit." and "I yield, I yield." I conditioned those out for him.
  
* [Kematu](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Kematu): When first meeting him, you can ask "*Why are you after Saadia?*" and he'll explain like normal. But when you choose the other prompt afterward he says "*What is it she's calling herself? Shazra? Saadia?*" even though you just said her name was Saadia. As such I changed the line: "*Why are you after ~~Saadia~~ this Redguard woman?*"
When the player is a vampire, several NPCs will comment: *"Your skin's a pale as the snow. Are you afraid of the sunlight or something?"* This makes no sense, especially if the player is a Redguard, or beast race, but also in general vampires in Skyrim aren't really that pale. As such I conditioned out this line.
  
* [Adril Arano](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Adril_Arano)﻿: When you first arrive in Solstheim, he'll say: *"Just remember, Raven Rock is sovereign territory of House Redoran. This is Morrowind~~, not Skyrim.~~ While you're here you will be expected to abide by our laws."* The part where he says "This is Morrowind, not Skyrim." felt too meta, so I left the "not Skyrim" part out.
[Lleril Morvayn](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Lleril_Morvayn): I changed a player dialogue: *"Council? ~~You mean there's no Jarl?~~ Whom do you mean by that?"* and his response *"~~This isn't Skyrim, outlander.~~ A group of powerful and influential Dunmer families have been ruling Morrowind for millennia."* Just as Adril Arano's edit, this seemed too meta.
  
* [Farkas](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Farkas) ﻿and [Vilkas](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Vilkas)﻿, during the [Dragon Seekers](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dragon_Seekers)﻿ quest: This quest is supposed to only start after the dragons have returned and the Companions questline is done, which means the dragons should have been back quite a while. However, Farkas and Vilkas will claim not to have seen any in this time. This felt out of place. As such, I changed the "dragons returned" requirement, to simply having finished [Unbound](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Unbound)﻿, for compatibility with alternate start mods. You would still need to have completed the Companions questline. If you start Dragon Seekers, AFTER the dragons have returned, I've included some alternate dialogue to make clear that Vilkas and Farkas did in fact know of their return.
[Aela](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Aela_the_Huntress), [Farkas](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Farkas) and [Ria](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ria) during the first encounter with Giant outside Whiterun: Aela will approach the player, forcegreeting them. Most often she'll say: "Well, that's taken care off. No thanks to you." However, if the player wants to lend a hit on the Giant, they'll have to rush over to it, before the fight is over. Regardless of that, Aela will stil suggest the player to become a Companion.
  
It's really weird to get such an offer after she has such scolded you for not helping out. This implies that she'd invite everyone she comes across to join them. [(Source for pointing this out: PatricianTV video)](https://youtu.be/dHP02JEC5H0?feature=shared&t=2258) Farkas and Ria will also say things in the lines of: "You look strong. Fight for us and be a companion." even when the player is a fresh level 1, without any combat experience. In order to adress this, I made the triggerbox for the event smaller, so it triggers later. In addition, I've added several lines to Aela for different roleplay options. The lines which has Farkas mention the player looks strong, are conditioned out, unless the player has a level in One-Handed, Two-handed, Block or Archery over 30\*, or has over 150\* in Health or Stamina.* [Saadia](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Saadia): She says "Now please, no more questions." even if her quest, [In My Time of Need](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:In_My_Time_Of_Need) hasn't even started. This makes her suspicious. For that reason, I added a condition so these lines only trigger if you're at stage 20 or more of the quest.
[Skjor](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Skjor), [Aela](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Aela_the_Huntress) and [Kodlak](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Kodlak_Whitemane) calling the player "whelp". I've added alternative lines where I removed this, if the player's level in One-Handed, Two-handed, Block or Archery over 30\*, or has over 150\* in Health or Stamina, or have completed the Main Quest, Dawnguard or Dragonborn DLC quest.
  
* [Angeline Morrard](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Angeline_Morrard) was sometimes refered to as "Angela" in dialogue. I replaced all instances of this with slightly altered lines.
[Niranye](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Niranye), when asked how long she's been in Windhelm, she'll respond: "Just got here from Summerset." I added a condition to have this dialogue no longer appear after a certain ingame days have passed.
  
* [Balgruuf](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Balgruuf_the_Greater)﻿: After you killed [Mirmulnir](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Mirmulnir) ﻿in [Dragon Rising](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dragon_Rising)﻿, you can inform him about [Whiterun's Western Watchtower](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Western_Watchtower)﻿: *"The watchtower was ~~destroyed~~ attacked, but we killed the dragon."* This is done because the watchtower was already in a poor state prior to the dragon attack.
[Urag gro-Shub](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Urag_gro-Shub): After you ask him about Elder Scrolls, he'll say: *"I'll bring everything we have on them, but it's not much. So don't get your hopes up. It's mostly lies, leavened with rumor and conjecture."* After he says this, you will exit dialogue automatically.
  
* [Tolfdir](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Tolfdir): After having met the first Psijic Monk in [Saarthal](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Saarthal), you can ask him about them. He'll say *"The Psijics have no connection to these ruins. And no one's seen any of their order in a long time. Perhaps we should take a look inside these coffins... Now please do be careful. Who knows what we're going to find."* After he says this, you will exit dialogue automatically.
[Markarth Guards](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Markarth_City_Guard): After having witnessed the murder at the market, the guards will ask you to stand back. You can ask them several questions. Each of them will now lead to exiting dilalogue automatically.
  
* [Idolaf Battle-Born](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Idolaf_Battle-Born): If you tell him you support the Gray-Manes, he'll say: "Then you're either a Stormcloak sympathizer or a fool. Either way, you're no friend of mine." After he says this, you will exit dialogue automatically.

  
  
\* You can change the required actor values and health/stam. (see customization)
  
  
**Distance checks
  
This is a seperate standalone file.**
  
These involve dialogue lines that another NPC shouldn't be hearing, as it's involving them.
  
  

  
* [Svana](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Svana_Far-Shield) and [Haelga](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Haelga): If you start the quest [Caught Red Handed](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Caught_Red_Handed), Svana will talk bad about Haelga, but in Vanilla there are no checks to see Haelga is near. It felt very jarring to me, that Svana talks bad about her while standing next to her. As such, I added a condition for Haelga to be outside the [bunkhouse](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Haelga%27s_Bunkhouse), for the dialogue to trigger on Svana.
[Sven](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Sven) and [Faendal](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Faendal) in Riverwood: They'll need to standing a certain distance from each other for the dialogue to trigger.
  
* [Mulush](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Mulush_gro-Shugurz)﻿, [Hathrasil](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Hathrasil) ﻿and [Omluag](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Omluag) ﻿in Markarth: Mulush will need to be a certain distance away for the scenes to trigger where Hathrasil and Omluag talk bad about Mulush. Also, to start the quest to tell Mulush to stop harassing them, Mulush will need to not be near Omluag, when talking to Omluag. This is the [A Few Words With You](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:A_Few_Words_with_You)﻿ quest. I also included a patch for [Favor Quests Separated](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73903)﻿.
[Nirya](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Nirya)﻿ and [Faralda](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Faralda)﻿: When Nirya is talking to you about Faralda, Faralda needs to be a certain distance away.
  
* [Romlyn Dreth](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Romlyn_Dreth)﻿ and [Indaryn](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Indaryn)﻿: Romlyn has [a quest](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Under_the_Table)﻿ which involves selling stolen mead "under the table". He even mentions to stay clear of Indaryn. Yet, for some reason, this dialogue was available when both of them are sitting next to each other in the Bee and Barb. As such, I've added a distance check.
[Mallus](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Mallus_Maccius) and [Sabjorn](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Sabjorn): During [Dampened Spirits](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dampened_Spirits), Mallus says: "I can't wait to see Sabjorn squirm." He now needs to be a certain distance away from Sabjorn to say this line.
  
* [Nirya](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Nirya), [Savos Aren](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Savos_Aren) and [Mirabelle](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Mirabelle_Ervine): Before the player has finished the College questline, Nirya says "I think the College is due for a change in leadership." She now needs to be a certain distance away from Savos and Mirabelle to say this line.
[Dremora](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dremora) often times call their enemy mortal, even if they were fighting Dwarven Automations, Daedra, Undead or Dragons, despite those not being "mortal" in TES lore. I corrected this, by merging my other mod, [Dremora Combat Dialogue Tweak](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93583).
  
* Guards will comment if you're wielding an Iron Sword, advising you to use a better weapon, even if they themselves use one. I'ev adressed that.
Imperial soldiers will complain that "This Imperial armor is damn heavy." even if they aren't wearing heavy armor. As such I added conditions for it.
  
* [Brynjolf](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Brynjolf), [Brand-Shei](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Brand-Shei) and [Madesi](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Madesi): Brynjolf will no longer forcegreet the player during A Chance Arrangement, to prevent him from explaining his scheme when too close to either Madesi or Brand-Shei.
The children at [Honorhall Orphanage](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Honorhall_Orphanage)﻿: If [Grelod](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Grelod_the_Kind) ﻿is killed, they will yell: "It's Grelod." I've added a distance check to this.
  

  
  
**Optional edits**
  
  
These edits are controversial and as such have been moved into seperate optional files.
  

  
* **Kodlak Does Lead The Companions**. Early during the Companions questline, it's often mentioned that the Harbinger does not lead the Companions, despite Kodlak actively making decissions and having the biggest bedroom. Later on, it is actually implied that Harbinger is a leader role, not merely an advisor. For this reason, I attempted to remove any mentions of the Harbinger not being a leader. As this is highly subjective, I decided to make it a standalone file.
[Heimskr](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Heimskr): During his speech he refers to Nirn as "earth", while this is done nowhere else in the TES universe. As such, I changed the following line: *"The very idea is inconceivable to our Elven overlords! Sharing the heavens with us? With man? Ha! ~~They can barely tolerate our presence on earth!~~ I don't think so."* (As of v1.9.5 this is now a seperate file, as there are different interpretations of "earth".)
  
* **Solstheim Dunmer Dialogue**: This optional plugin disables Morrowind related dialogue on Solstheim, if the player is a Dunmer.
**Windhelm Argonian Ban**: This optional plugin disables dialogue related to the Windhelm Argonian ban in the city.
  
* **Thieves Guild Five Year Time Gap**: This changes the timegap (between Gallus' death and the present day) mentioned in Karliah's and Mercer's dialogue from 25 years down to 5 years, to make it more believable. [(Source for pointing this out: PatricianTV video)](https://youtu.be/dHP02JEC5H0?feature=shared&t=9652)﻿
**Nurelion Edits**: [Nurelion](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Nurelion): He refers to himself as "an old man" on several occasions, while he is in fact an Altmer. I've edited out several of these: 1: *"You would do that? It's good to know there are some people out there who are willing to help ~~an old man.~~ me."*, 2: *"Of course, ~~leave an old man with a ruined dream.~~ Just like everyone else. Fool."* and 3: *"~~Just a man's life work, is all.~~ I've finally derived the location of the White Phial, but this doting busybody won't let me get it."* [Quintus Navale](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Quintus_Navale): He also refers to the player as one of the human races, while they can be mer or beastraces as well: *"Good to hear. ~~You can be a difficult man/woman to find.~~ Thankfully those couriers are tenacious."*
  

  
  
**Customization**
  
  
In addition to using console commands to set those values, you can also edit the globals in xEdit.
  
  
**Distance Checks**
  
  
You can customize the distance checks using the following console commands:
  
  

  
* set ANDR\_DialogueDistanceCheck\_SvenFaendal to X (default value: 1024)
set ANDR\_DialogueDistanceCheck\_MulushSmelterWorkers to X (default value: 2048)
  
* set ANDR\_DialogueDistanceCheck\_FaraldaNirya to X (default value: 2048)
set ANDR\_DialogueDistanceCheck\_RomlynIndaryn to X (default value: 2048)

set ANDR\_DialogueDistanceCheck\_SabjornMallus to X (default value: 1024)
  
* set ANDR\_DialogueDistanceCheck\_ChildGrelod to X (default value: 512)

  
X is the minimum distance check that needs to be between the two NPCs, in [Skyrim units](https://www.creationkit.com/index.php?title=Unit).
  
  
**Required Actor Values for Aela's dialogue**
  
  
You can customize required actor values (one-handed, two-handed, block, archery) and health/stamina, for Aela's dialogue using the following console commands:
  
  

  
* set NGCDT\_GLOB\_Aela\_AVMin to X (This determines minimum required level in one-handed, two-handed, block or archery. Default value: 30)
set NGCDT\_GLOB\_Aela\_HMSMin to X (This determines minimum required value in health or stamina. Default value: 150)
  

  
X is the minimum requiremed amount.
  
  
**FAQ**
  
  
Q: What's the point of this?
  
A: "Fer uhmershun!" In all seriousness, I made this mod as a request. If it's not your cup of tea, that's okay. This mod isn't for everyone. #YourGameYourWay
  
  
Q: "Isn't this part of the unreliable narrator?"
  
A: "There's part for that in certain parts of the game, however, in my opinion, the cases adressed in this mod do not feel under this, since the NPCs should know these things."
  
  
Q: "Isn't Nirnroot supposed the not grow back? It was like that in Oblivion."
  
A: "I found it easier to fix it the other way around. If you feel inclined to actually make it not grow back, feel free to do so."
  
  
Q: "There's already a mod that's adressing that dialogue from Wuunferth, namely [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56378?). What's the difference between that one and yours? Will you make a patch?"
  
A: Yes, I am aware of that mod and I consider it a great alternative to mine. The difference is that that one uses synthed dialogue and mine uses spliced dialogue. I have no plans to make a patch."
  
  
Q: ESPFE?
  
A: Yes.
  
  
Q: Does installing/updating/uninstalling on an existing save work?
  
A: As far as I know, it should. However, it's good practice to keep a backup save prior to doing this, just in case.
  
  
Q: Is this compatible with <insert mod>?
  
A: I don't know by heart. You might need to check yourself.
  
  
Q: Will you make a patch for <insert mod>?
  
A: Only if it's a mod I use myself or plan on using, I have enough time and I actually like the idea. Otherwise, feel free to do it yourself. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: I have a suggestion to improve the mod. Can you do it?
  
A: Maybe, if I have time and I like the idea, I'll consider it.
  
  
Q: Will you port this to <insert platform>?
  
A: No, I myself only support the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If someone else wants to port it, feel free. (see permission) If you decide to port it, you yourself take full responsibility to offer support to said port. I will not provide no support for any ports by third parties.
  
  
Q: I use a ported version of this mod on <insert platform> and I have a problem. Can you help?
  
A: I don't provide any support for third party ports on other platforms than the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If you have issues, you should adress the person that ported it.
  
  
Q: Does this work on Skyrim 1.6+, aka "Anniversary Edition"?
  
A: Yes, it should.
  
  
Q: Why don't your mods use MCMs and instead use this janky console command system to set globals?
  
A: I am not a fan of MCMs. You can set the globals by making a patch in xEdit. I have no plans of changing this. If you want to add an MCM, feel free. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: Why don't you use FOMODs?
  
A: That would require reuploading the entire mod, in question, even if I only make a small change. My internet is limited and reuploading the files each time will take a huge chunk of my monthly volume.
