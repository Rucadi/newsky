Hi everyone!
  
  
This is a small mod I made while taking a break from a bigger project. Have you ever noticed how the pile of tree trunks in Riverwood is seriously wonky? They're half in the dirt, half melted into each other. Using BOS, this mod fixes that wooden weirdness. It's just a small fix, but it's bugged me for ages. 
  
  
Update 1.1. The log pile in Falkreath is now fixed and included too.
  
  
Installation:
  
  
1) Install Base Object Swapper. Make sure you have the latest version.
  
2) Endorse that mod.
  
3) Make sure you have Happly Little Trees or Ulvenwald installed if choosing those versions. Endorse those mods!
  
4) Install this mod, and overwrite if prompted. Enjoy!
  
  
Small-ish print... I don't use any of the Riverwood overhauls on the Nexus, so I don't know if this is fixed by other mods. You may or may not need this if you use JK's or another Riverwood overhaul.
