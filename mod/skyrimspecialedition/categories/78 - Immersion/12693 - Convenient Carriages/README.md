# Convenient Carriages
- Author: tarlazo
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12693


Adds carriages in **Morthal**, **Dawnstar**, **Falkreath**, **Winterhold**, **Rorikstead**, **Ivarstead**.
  
The "Beyond Skyrim - Bruma" version also adds carriages near the **Cyrodiil border** and **Bruma**.
  
The "Helgen Reborn" version adds another carriage in **Helgen**.
  
  
The drivers have a daily schedule and a campsite where they rest and sleep. The Hearthfire drivers take advantage of the house (this can be disabled in the installer).
  
  
If you can't find the driver (he could be loitering around, sheltering from bad weather, sleeping, or whatever), sit on the cart and he'll get to work (disabled in Winterhold).
  
If the driver is sleeping or indoors, his clever horse gives him a holler (disabled in Winterhold).
  
When you hire a driver, he goes to the cart and waits for you.
  
The drivers are not in a hurry and wait a while before starting to complain about your tardiness. The Hearthfire drivers never hurry you up.
  
  
If a driver tells you "*Look out, I think we have company*", you can't travel because you are considered 'in combat', even if you don't know who or what is pissed off with you.
  
I added this extravagant feature because missing dialogue options, although a vanilla behavior, seem to have made someone think that something was wrong with the mod.
  
  
In Winterhold the weather is harsh and the outskirts dangerous, so Loddvar waits at the inn.
  
Blow his horn and he will quickly come (no pun intended, the horn is on the hay bale), or hire him inside the inn and go to the carriage.
  
He swaps his indoor light outfit with a warmer one when outdoors, but this behavior can be disabled in the MCM.
  
  
**Installation**
  
Install, re-install, or switch to a different CC version (Vanilla, Bruma, Helgen) while **away from carriage camps**, even better on a save made in an interior location or a capital city. This obviously doesn't matter in case of a new game start.
  
**You can travel to** Darkwater Crossing, Dawnstar, Dragon Bridge, Falkreath, Heljarchen Hall, Ivarstead, Karthwasten, Lakeview Manor, Markarth, Morthal, Nightgate Inn, Old Hroldan, Riften, Riverwood, Rorikstead, Shor's Stone, Solitude, the Whiterun/Rorikstead/Markarth/Falkreath crossroad (named 'near Fort Sungard' for brevity), the NW Coast, Whiterun, Windhelm, Windstad Manor, Winterhold.
  
Also, to the border with Cyrodiil (Pale Pass), Bruma and/or Helgen if you install the dedicated versions.
  
The Hearthfire destinations are available when you buy the properties.
  
  
**With the Beyond Skyrim - Bruma version** you can travel to the border, but only after having started the "Welcome to Cyrodiil" quest; going to Pale pass by carriage could cause the quest to glitch and don't start properly.
  
From Pale Pass you can also travel to Bruma after having completed the quest, and from Bruma back to Skyrim.
  
Being the border closed and guarded, only the authorized driver is allowed to travel to Bruma.
  
**With the Helgen Reborn version** you can travel to Helgen after the "Desperate Times" quest.
  
A new driver moves in later when the rebuilding is almost completed.
  
  
**Carriage travel when encumbered** is allowed, but it costs 50 extra septims by default.
  
The installer has a few options to customize the baggage fees, weight-based or scot-free.Spoiler
  
Default - A 50-Gold surcharge when traveling overloaded.
  
 ﻿ ﻿ Quite unrealistic since it depends on your own carry weight limit.
  
  
Realistic - Up to 500 Weight Units in inventory: Free;
  
 ﻿ ﻿   501 WU to 1,000 WU: 50 Gold;
  
 ﻿ ﻿   1,001 WU to 2,000 WU: 100 Gold;
  
 ﻿ ﻿   More than 2,000 WU: The poor horse refuses to move.
  
           
  
Lenient - Up to 1,000 Weight Units in inventory: Free;
  
 ﻿ ﻿ 1,001 WU to 2,000 WU: 50 Gold;
  
  ﻿ ﻿2,001 WU to 4,000 WU: 100 Gold;
  
 ﻿ ﻿ More than 4,000 WU: The poor horse refuses to move.
  
          
  
Scot-free - No weight checks, no extra fees.
  
**Travel fares**
  
The prices can be customized in the MCM from nil to ludicrous.
  
If you have mods that allow to change the same prices via MCM, this should be perfectly compatible.
  
If you have mods that change the same prices via esp, load this after them.
  
  
**Ferry add-on**
  
Cross the ~~Styx~~ river by boat in Solitude and Windhelm for one coin and keep your feet dry.
  
Row from Castle Volkihar to Dawnstar, Solitude, Windhelm; strong back required, but free of charge.
  
The boatmen don't sit all the time, they walk around a little to stretch their legs and butts.
  
**Gorgeous, high-poly, covered carriage**, courtesy of mathy79.
  
2K textures are included in the .bsa; 4K textures are available as installer option.
  
  
**Convenient Storage and Delivery**
  
The Storage and Delivery service works like a more lore-friendly, less OP 'bag of holding'; you might appreciate it if you have mods that punish the player for high inventory weight.
  
If you managed to drag yourself and your loot to a carriage station without slipping on your own sweat, you can ask the driver to send for your personal container that's stored at the Drivers Guild warehouse.
  
When you leave the area the crate is sent back into storage.
  
If you're also planning a travel, you can ask for the retrieved crate to be shipped to your destination, including ones without a carriage.
  
The service costs 50 gold for retrieving (100 at the Cyrodiil border and Bruma), and 50 (100) for shipping.
  
Your employed drivers (the Hearthfire ones) won't ask for gold.
  
 For technical reasons, the option is available only when the driver is outdoors.
  
Enabled by default; with SkyUI a menu allows to toggle the service on/off.
  
  
**Convenient Passengers**
  
When approaching a carriage station you might sometimes see a random passenger...
  
Nothing fancy, it just tries to convey the impression that you're not the only one using a carriage in Skyrim.
  
For better compatibility with other mods and patches, this is only enabled in Whiterun, Riften, Markarth, Windhelm, Solitude, Falkreath, Ivarstead, Morthal.
  
The passengers only spawn when you're far enough from the carriage. For example, in Riften you need to arrive from the countryside; getting out of the main gate doesn't allow for a spawn chance. For the same reason, arriving after a carriage travel doesn't trigger a spawn.
  
The spawn chance is set to 65%.
  
Enabled by default; with SkyUI a menu allows to toggle the passengers on/off and customize the chance for spawns.
  
 Thanks to novastark for the idea.
  
  
**Convenient Guards**
  
Not much to explain; they hang around and keep an eye out.
  
It might look like they don't do much, but it's a false impression; they have a rich repertoire of amazingly witty and novel comments to delight you with.
  
Enabled by default; with SkyUI a menu allows to toggle them on/off.
  
If you have "Helgen Reborn", the Helgen guard is disabled by default and can be enabled only by the config menu.
  
 Thanks to ColossusX13 for the idea.
  
  
**Not-so-convenient Accidents**
  
Five random, carriage-related road encounters ('road encounters' are those like the old orc, the roadside thief, the skooma peddler, and so on). To be clear, you can see them when walking or riding along a road, they don't happen when traveling by carriage.

  
* Carriage with dead horse and disgruntled driver.
Carriage attacked by bloodthirsty bandits. Passenger and horse succumbed but the driver is a tough one. You may help him and he'll even thank you (just gratitude, no reward, greedy players are welcome to loot the passenger) -- non-Reach only.
  
* Roadside carnage with driver, horse, and passenger dead and burning -- only happens after having enabled the dragons.
Overturned carriage with squashed driver and passenger; the likely culprit managed to run away.
  
* Forsworn attack with customary slaughter and angry Forsworn -- Reach only.

Coming soon:SpoilerEnabled by default with a 50% chance of being skipped. With SkyUI a menu allows to set the chance for spawns or disable the encounters.
  
Thanks to milankovalcik and Ringo Kid for the idea.
  
The installer has an optional patch which flattens the terrain at the spawn points (where it's possible and sensible), allowing a better placement of the carts.
  
The patch might conflict with other landscape-editing mods, but you could load it before them and take advantage only of the non-conflicting locations.
  
  
**Horse Change add-on**
  
Every eight hours (more or less, it also depends on your activity) the carriage horses are replaced with fresh, random ones.
  
This will most likely conflict with horse overhauls unless they have only meshes and/or textures (no esp).
  
If you get invisible horses or other horrific outcomes, you'll need to either remove the add-on or patch it.
  
  
**Follower Sits**
  
After choosing a destination, your followers walk to the carriage and one of them sits upon it... très immersif :)
  
To start the travel you sit on the carriage as usual.
  
Before sitting, you *could* wait a little and bask in the glory of this groundbreaking and awe-inspiring feature, but of course you don't have to.
  
Supports up to five followers.
  
NOTE: Some custom followers seem to be incompatible, in that case they will just go on with their business.
  
Enabled by default; with SkyUI the menu allows to toggle the feature on/off.
  
Thanks to Terenzz for the idea and the beta testing.
  
  
**Carriage Travel Speed tweak**
  
Available in the installer, **requires SKSE**, doesn't add plugins.
  
Sets the fast travel speed multiplier during carriage travels to 2.2, halfway between walking (when you fast travel the vanilla game assumes you're walking to destination, the default Skyrim value is 1.0) and running (something like 3.4), then resets it to default (1.0) when the journey ends.
  
For example, carriage travel from Winterhold to Whiterun takes normally about 6.5 hours; with the tweak it would be around 3 hours.
  
The idea is giving better immersion if you agree that a horse pulling a cart can travel long distances somewhat quicker than a man on foot, as opposed to the usual fast travel 'fixes' assuming that a dude can run no-stop from Winterhold to Markarth and still be as fresh as a daisy.
  
If you don't agree, never mind, it's optional.
  
  
Better don't enable this if you wish to keep your own modded fast travel setting (e.g., "Fast Travel Speed Fix" or "Accurate and Realistic [?] Fast Travel Time"), it might get a little confusing otherwise.*(\*)*
  
There are mods whose apparent purpose isn't editing travel settings, but for some reason they do it anyway (e.g., "Obsidian Weathers").
  
Other mods might edit more settings besides fast travel.
  
In those cases you can enable the tweak and simply place this mod lower in the load order.
  
With mods that only edit the fast travel speed the load order method still works, but then they would be quite useless; better remove them if you decide to enable this.
  
*(\*)SpoilerFor example, you might load a game with the multiplier set to 3.4 by a mod, a carriage travel would run at 2.2 and the value would be reset to 1.0 at the end of the journey.
  
You would fast-travel via map with the default 1.0 value till you exit the game, then it would be back to 3.4 when you launch it again, and so on -- crazy.
  
True, I might store the current modded value and re-apply it at the end of the journey, but then carriage travels would be slower than map travel -- ridiculous.
  
Or I might store the current modded value, increase it for the carriage travel, and then re-apply it, but then the poor horse would have to fly like a Pegasus -- silly.
  
All this hoo-ha because edits to game settings made by scripts are not saved. While they'll persist across consecutive save loads during the same game session, they'll be wiped when the game closes and will revert to their hardcoded or modded values the next time the game reloads the plugins.
  
So, my default is 1.0 like the vanilla one -- take it or leave it.*

Something wrong in the landscape around the carriages means that there's a conflict with some other mod -- tree or grass mods and town overhauls are the most likely culprits.
  
If you can't use SSEEdit to detect conflicts (which is always the safest, quickest, and better option), try to guess which mod could edit the terrain.
  
Try to change the load order.
  
If the change doesn't fix the errors or creates new ones, the mods are not compatible without a patch.
