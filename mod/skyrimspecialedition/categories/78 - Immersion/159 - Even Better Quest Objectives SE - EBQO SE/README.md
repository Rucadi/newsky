**Even Better Quest Objectives SE**

**This Mod is Now and** [Forever Free](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/65163/).
  
**|** [Skyrim LE version](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32695)﻿ **|**

  
  
**Description**
  
  
This mod enhances the quest descriptions in the vanilla game so that you have a clear sense of where you are supposed to go and what you are supposed to do besides looking at the quest markers. Let's face it - the quest descriptions were quite bad, not specifying where you are supposed to go by themselves, and forcing you to play with the quest markers on all the time. This affects nearly 250 quest objectives/descriptions, spanning over 160 quests, editing descriptions that were either really vague or didn't exist at all.
  
  
This mod directly succeeds whickus's Better Quest Objectives for the original, vanilla Skyrim.
  
  
A few things to consider: Some quests with ambiguous descriptions are left alone because they are meant to be riddles. They will not be modified - it's as likely as me cutting myself on a sharply observed portrait. Also, quests with journals that give information about the locations have the journals themselves edited instead of the descriptions.
  
  
Also, this mod does modify some of the vanilla scripts relating to some of the radiant quests. This is done so that the location would be properly displayed in the quest objectives. For now, only the scripts relating to DA09, DA10, MGR20, MGR20b, MGR21, MGRArniel04, and MGRitual05 are modified - more might come soon.

**Installation**
  

  
1. Download with your mod manager
Install using the provided FOMOD, paying attention to the option descriptions
  
*Manual installation is possible, but is not recommended; file format is BAIN, for these savvy users.*
  

  
[LOOT](https://loot.github.io/) is highly recommended! All patches were created with a default LOOT-sorted load order. The patches can be merged using [Merge Plugins Standalone](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/69905/?), for those still using that tool. However, it's not recommended to merge the main plugin.
  
  
  
**Uninstallation**
  
Remove with your mod manager, or remove any files starting with *"BetterQuestObjectives"* from the data folder.
  
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
Anything that modifies the vanilla quests or quest books can overwrite the better descriptions from this mod. If your mod does so, I would recommend making a compatibility patch between both mods, or integrating the changes from this mod into yours.
  

  
* [House of Horrors - Quest Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57285)﻿ - this mod's scripts should overwrite EBQO's

  
  
**Recommended Mods**
  

  
* [Finding Derkeethus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19550) - further improves the overlooked Derkeethus rescue quest. The Argonian bro deserves special treatment.
[Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266/?) - fixes a \***lot**\* of the bugs that Bethesda didn't get to.
