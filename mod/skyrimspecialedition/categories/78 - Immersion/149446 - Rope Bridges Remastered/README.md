Hi everyone!
  
  
Wow, this mod was a lot of work! Like most of us, I've been playing Oblivion Remastered. I love the rope bridges in the remastered game and decided that I'd like to try to make something like that for Skyrim. Obviously, great minds think alike because wSkeever released [Logical Rope Bridges](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/148652?tab=description) and addressed some of the issues with Skyrim's rather sorry rope bridges. This mod builds on wSkeever's and adds more SMIM-style touches to the bridges. It also fixes a few vanilla issues that I couldn't let go. Now, it doesn't cover all the rope bridges yet, and it requires wSkeever's mod to be installed first. There are two versions of the mod with more or less ropes. The full version may make the most sense as each board is fastened to the bridge, but if you're on a lower-end PC and you're trying to conserve your draw calls, I'm pretty sure the 'some ropes' version will suffice (it's what I'll be using). Both versions have an option to use either the SMIM textures or [Better Ropes for Skyrim SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/290?tab=description)(which I use). 
  
  
Installation:
  
  
Check out the gallery for the version you want to use.
  
  
1) Install ﻿[Logical Rope Bridges](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/148652?tab=description)2) Endorse that mod.
  
3) Install this mod and overwrite when prompted. 
  
  
As I said, this was a fiddly mod, with a lot of branches in nifs in play, and I may have made a texture path error. Let me know if you get any purple ropes when you're playing and I'll get a fix uploaded.
  
  
Future plans:
  
  
I need a break to work up to this again ?, but I plan to finish work on the rest of the bridges and further optimise the meshes.
  
  
A big thank you to wSkeever for allowing their mod to be used as a modder's resource. This mod is offered with the same CCA4 licence. Please see the permissions tab for more information.
