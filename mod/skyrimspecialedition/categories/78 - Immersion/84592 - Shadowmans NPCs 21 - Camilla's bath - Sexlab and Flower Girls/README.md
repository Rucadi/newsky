========================
  
  
Description:
  
Every morning at 5 o'clock when it's dark and everyone is sleeping, Camilla Valerius will bathe in the river next to the bridge.
  
In the end of her bath at 6 she will drop her bottle of soap.
  
Take the bottle and talk to her to give it back like a true gentleman.

It was a very complicated mod for me to make. I spent an incredible amount of time testing and retesting, solving all kinds of problems. I hope nothing escaped me.
  
  
A long time ago when I posted a picture of Camilla bathing in my mod sidequests of skyrim for flower girls, someone asked if there is a mod that makes Camilla bathe.
  
Well, there is now.

> ﻿﻿I mean...OF COURSE Camilla bathes in the river. She and Gerdur probably have bubble bath fights on Thursdays.

> ﻿I wasn't peeking, I swear. I just saw the soap and wanted to return it to its rightful owner.

> ﻿I just happened to come upon the soap and thought it would be a gentlemanly gesture to return it.

> ﻿I may have stumbled upon the soap, but I assure you I did not witness anything inappropriate.

> ﻿I may have picked up the soap, but I swear I did not see anything.

> ﻿I assure you, I was simply trying to do a good deed by returning the soap.

> ﻿I may have picked up the soap, but I was too busy keeping my eyes to myself to see anything.
