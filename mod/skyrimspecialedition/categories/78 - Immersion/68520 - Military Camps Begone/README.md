# Military Camps Begone

**Backstory**
  
I dutifully cleared, as suggested by the bosses, one of the Stormcloak military camps after the war.
  
When I happened to have a look at it later, to my surprise the soldiers were all alive and kicking, bar the commander, the quartermaster, and the wounded ones... odd.
  
  
**What this does**
  
If you kill a commander, after 7/10 days his camp is taken down (looted by scavengers?)
  
If a commander is already dead when you install the mod, his camp is removed as soon as you get near it (more specifically, when its cell gets attached).
  
  
**Note**
  
Unfortunately, you need to have USSEP installed for this to work properly.
  
I don't have civil war mods and this has been made for vanilla.
  
I don't know how it would work with the countless civil war mods available, and I'm most certainly not going to download them all and check for compatibility :)
  
If someone reports incompatibilities and requests a specific patch, I will consider making it.
