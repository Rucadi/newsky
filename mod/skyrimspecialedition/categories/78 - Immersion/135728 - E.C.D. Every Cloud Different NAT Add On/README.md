E.C.D. Every Cloud Different is an addon for NAT weather

  

This mod will change and diversify all clouds in all different meteo situation ( from sunny to cloudy to storm ect) 
  
every single "weather" has been modify and retouched
  
mixing my best clouds from my mods and the unique clouds of NAT
  
  
It also add some visual effects:
  
 - distant rain 
  
- far lightning on clouds
  
- mist effect 
  
  
You need to have NAT3 weather installed ( NAT-ENB.esp  as master )
  
Patched Esp if you want to use it together  with my other add on for NAT [From Dusk till Dawn NAT ADDON](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/127059)
