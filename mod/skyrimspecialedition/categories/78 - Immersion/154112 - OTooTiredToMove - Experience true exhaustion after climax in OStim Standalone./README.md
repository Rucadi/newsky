# OTooTiredToMove - Experience true exhaustion after climax in OStim Standalone.

Have you ever felt that something was off when, after an intense scene full of poses and climax, the character just casually walks away as if nothing happened? Like… really? No reaction at all? It breaks immersion.
  
  
This mod fixes that. Now, there’s a moment of exhaustion, as there should be.

Safe to install mid game.
  
  
**Make sure to rerun FNIS (or Nemesis/Pandora, depending on your setup).**
  
  
  
  
Upgrading
  
  
Okay, for those who are using version 1 and are preparing to update to version 1.1:
  
  
You will need to update on a clean save (meaning a save that hasn’t had this mod installed before) or start the new game. You can also clean an existing save to update without causing errors. You can do this just like how you updated OStim. If you’re not sure how to clean a save file, the method is mentioned in the description of the Ostim Standalone mod under the 'Upgrading' section; just follow the same procedure for this mod.
  
  
  
  
  
For Modders
  
  
I highly encourage other modders to create animations for this mod! xD
  
  
If you just want to replace the existing poses, simply overwrite them with your own.
  
However, if you want to add more animations or create male animations, you'll need to register them in the script file: *OTTTMCoreData*
  
If you're not sure how to do that or you're not familiar with Papyrus scripting, feel free to reach out to me. I’ll be happy to help you get it working! xD

FAQ
  
  
ESP-FE?
  
Of course.
  
  
  
Why does the mod support male characters but still isn't usable yet?
  
While this mod technically supports male characters, there are currently no animations available for them. That means even if you enable the male option or try to apply it to a male player character, it simply won’t work.
  
  
Before creating this mod, I had zero experience with making animations or poses. Even creating the female poses alone was extremely difficult for me — it took a lot of time and effort to learn how to do it properly, and to adjust each position until they looked right.
  
That’s why I’ve been hesitant to work on male poses. As someone with no background in animation, I know it would take just as much (if not more) time and energy to get them working.
  
  
I truly hope skilled animators in the modding community can help contribute male animations  and maybe even expand the female animation set as well. Your help would make this mod more complete for everyone.
  
  
  
I'm having issues with the tongue when using the ahegao feature (missing tongue, distorted tongue, tongue misaligned with the mouth, etc.).
  
It’s not an issue caused by this mod. This mod doesn’t interfere with how the tongue functions. Technically, all this mod does is take the tongue from the HALOS mod and attach it to the character - just like equipping a piece of armor.
  
So if your tongue isn’t working properly, the issue likely lies with the HALOS mod itself. Even if the tongue appears misaligned, that’s still up to the HALOS mod, because it controls where and how the tongue is positioned.
  
  
**For those experiencing a tongue that’s misaligned from the mouth (like I did in the past):**
  
One solution is to install the *HALOS Human HDT Tongueslide* mod. Then, open *BodySlide*, go to the *Outfit/Body* section, and select the tongue you want, for example: [AtomicSkull]HALOS Tongue linga1
  
  
After that, use the sliders below to adjust the position to your liking. For example, if the tongue is too low, use the *Tongue Up* slider to move it up. Once you’re satisfied, click *Build*, and you’re done.
  
  
This is how I personally fixed it**.**If you run into other problems, I recommend asking on the original mod pages. I probably won’t be much help since I don’t fully understand how all of it works either xD
