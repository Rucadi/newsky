Hi everyone!
  
  
Have you ever stood under one of those rock arches in Skyrim and wondered, "How the hell is this thing standing?" In the vanilla game, these arches seem to be made of a mix of stacked and levitating rocks.

The mesh is called norextwallbghenge01, and so I ran with that henge idea and made something that I thought fitted the laws of gravity a bit better. So far, I've made three henges. Using the magic that is Base Object Swapper, they'll be swapped for the original henges without any landscape edits. The esl flagged esp is just to add the records for the three variants. For these versions I've changed the textures to use the game's rock textures, because they're great big rocks :)
  
  
I've also made two optional vanilla-esque versions that fix the original mesh without making any dramatic changes. They're replacers without any variants (and so don't require BOS), in case you just want to fix the original and move on. The first version just fixes those floating rocks. The second breaks the pillars into stacked rocks as well as fixing the floaties. Check out the gallery for more on an idea of how they look.
  
  
As always, thanks for checking out the mod!
