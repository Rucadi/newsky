Instructions:
  
It only works on NPC's with Sultry voice. Use any mod followers you have. You can change follower voices with xedit/CK if needed.
  
I envisioned a latina maid and the sultry voice seemed the best choice for me.
  
A mod like [My home is your home](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20227) to assign her a location and sleeping space is recommended.
  
Some of the dialogue choices are only available inside your house.
  
  
To hire her, have more than 500 coins and wear any ring. 
  
Console command to be a millionaire: player.AddItem 0000000F 999999
  
To fire her, talk to her wearing the dark brotherhood outfit.
  
  
I'm using a [follower](https://arca.live/b/tullius/62361144?p=1) maid from a Korean site in the pics and she includes the outfit. She is in whiterun jorvarsk.
