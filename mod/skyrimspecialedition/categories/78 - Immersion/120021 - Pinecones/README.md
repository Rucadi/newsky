# Pinecones

Hey everyone!
  
  
Here's a mod you didn't think you needed (you may still not!): Pinecones in Skyrim! Like some crazy pinecone fairy, I've hand-placed over two hundred pinecones throughout Falkreath, Riverwood, and the surrounding forests. You can collect them, stack them (I managed two), you can sell them for one gold each, you can use them in alchemy (since update 1.1), but, most likely, you'll come across them in forests and think they're a nice bit of immersion. I dig pinecones so I thought they'd make a cool addition. I hope you enjoy their addition, too.
  
  
Where you'll see them: Falkreath, Riverwood, the pine forests, at the base of trees, you may see one or two bobbing in streams.
  
Where you won't find them: Generally, I've tried to place them on flat surfaces to avoid them rolling away or gathering in too large groups. 
  
  
Installation: Download and install. The mod includes a mesh, textures and an esl flagged plugin to add the cones. For the latest version, Base Object Swapper is required.
  
  
The original pinecone model used in this mod was created by 3DHDScan and is used in accordance with a Creative Commons Attribution License. In creating the mod, I decimated the original (using Blender) to reduce the poly count and made the mesh compatible with Skyrim SE's format. I also edited and adjusted the textures.
  
  
Enjoy!
