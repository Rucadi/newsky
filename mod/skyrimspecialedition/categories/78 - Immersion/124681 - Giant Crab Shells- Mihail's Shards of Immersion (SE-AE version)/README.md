![](https://i.imgur.com/PwJxVUw.png)[/font][/left][left][font=Times New Roman]*Now you can find along the windswept coasts, or in the icy depths of the Sea of ​​Ghosts, the long-abandoned shells of ancient, legendary giant crabs that sank the ships of the Nords of old, and were defeated in combat by the most formidable warriors, bringing peace to the seas of Skyrim in times gone by.
  
  
Giant shells of various sizes can be found, ranging from the same size as the unique giant mudcrab shell found in the vanilla game in the Whiterun tundra, to even colossal tower-sized ones. There's no doubt that your trips to the coast will have an extra epic feel.
  
  
The vanilla giant shell found in the Whiterun tundra and mentioned above has been textured in 4k, to keep it on par with my new additions in quality. However, the textures of the living vanilla mudcrabs are not affected by this mod.
  
  
Loot or enemies, sometimes both, can be found in some cases using the giant shells as hideouts.
  
  
One last addendum, these are giant crabs from the past, a past of greater heroes and greater challenges to overcome in the form of larger than life beasts, but they are not Emperor Crabs, which have a very different appearance, although some were even more colossal than the crabs in this mod.*

(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Shards of Immersion saga brings small elements that add a touch of immersion and realism to the fantastic world of Skyrim, making it even more alive and dynamic, which seems to exist beyond the adventure of the Dragonborn.

Author: Mihail- The models used in this mod are the same as the Whiterun tundra's vanilla dead mudcrab carapace, that can be found next to a small pond, and made from an edited living Mudcrab, but modified to have the shape of a dead one, with pieces missing. Textures initially at 1024x1024 resolution are now at 4k. Game implementation of the new giant crab shells.
