**For those who play without fast travel enabled. Hope you all enjoy it![size=3]**All wayshrines are built using vanilla assets, so hopefully there won't be any conflicts arising.[/size]
  
Inspired by the wayshrines introduced in Elder Scrolls Online (but function differently due to lore reasons).
  
They won't activate at first, so you'll need to figure out how to get them to work (hint: look at the picture!)

**Installation Requirements**
