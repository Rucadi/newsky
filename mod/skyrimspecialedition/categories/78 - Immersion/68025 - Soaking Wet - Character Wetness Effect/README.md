# Soaking Wet - Character Wetness Effect
- Author: SlavicPotato

**Overview**
  
  
A SKSE64 plugin that makes characters appear wet when in water and optionally in the rain or snow by dynamically applying glossiness/specularity to their skin, hair, armor and weapons. Works on the player and NPCs. Once out of the water, the character begins drying. Soak/dry times can be changed, transitions are seamless.
  
  
Works with ENB wet surfaces and mods which use shaders for wet effects (water drip for example) or change body specular map textures to give a more detailed wet look to actors. If you feel the specular effect is too high you can lower it in the config (MaxSpecularStrength).
