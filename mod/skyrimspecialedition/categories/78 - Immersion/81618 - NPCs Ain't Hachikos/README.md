[size=3]**Description**
  
  
This mod fixes some NPCs just standing in the same place 24/7 under certain conditions (it's not really a bug fix because all of this was intended that way):
  
[/size]

  
* When you take a radiant quest from one of the Companions, he/she stands beside the Jorrvaskr main doors 24/7 waiting for you to return.With this mod they do their usual stuff, nothing changes when you take a quest.
[Louis Letrush](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Louis_Letrush)﻿ just stands in the same place in The Bee and Barb inn 24/7 until you take his quest. With this mod he also randomly sits on the nearby bench, and doesn't stand at night.
  
* [Shadr](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Shadr)﻿ sits on the bridge in the Riften 24/7 [size=2]after the scene with Saphire ends until you take his quest. With this mod he will only sit there for an hour (in game time) and then go do his usual stuff.[/size]

For fixing Faralda i recommend my [Open College](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/79707).
  
For carriage drivers i recommend [Carriage Drivers Are Alive](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51260).
  
  
Tell me if you know more NPCs like that (if they aren't already fixed by AI Overhaul or Immersive Citizens).
  
[size=3]**Compatibility**
  
  
[/size]

  
* Compatible with [USSEP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266)﻿.
Doesn't edit any NPC records.
  
* [Immersive Citizens - AI Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/173) ﻿seems to include similar changes except Shadr. I recommend to place this mod before Immersive Citizens.
[AI Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21654)﻿ doesn't conflict with this mod.
  
* [size=2]There are multiple mods that include the same tweak for the Companions, for these mods the load order shouldn't matter. [/size]
[At Your Own Pace: Misc](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52704)﻿ includes a similar tweak for Shadr. If you agree with me that it's better for him to stay for a while instead of immediately walking away once the scene ends, then place my mod after At Your Own Pace.
