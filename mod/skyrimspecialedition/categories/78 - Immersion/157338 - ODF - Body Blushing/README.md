# ODF - Body Blushing

This Overlay Distribution framework configuration for Body Blushing is set up to apply a randomized natural flush effect to a small percentage of female NPCs across all standard female races. Beast races and vampires are excluded.
  
  
Each body region—front, back, arms, inside/outside limbs, and more—has been organized into logical overlay groups so NPCs receive natural-looking blushing in a consistent manner.
  
  
Colors have been hand-adjusted to reflect the underlying skin tones of different races. For example, Nords and Bretons receive lighter rosy pinks, while Redguards use deeper warm tones, and Dark Elves gain subtle purplish highlights to match their ashen skin.

By default the limit for body overlays is 6. Bump this up to around 12. Some of the sets in this mod distribute several overlays.
