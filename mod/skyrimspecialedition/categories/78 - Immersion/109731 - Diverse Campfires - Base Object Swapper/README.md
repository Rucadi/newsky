Hi everyone!
  
  
First things first, a huge thank you to [mindflux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3211380) for permission to create this mod using assets from the awesome  [Embers XD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37085) and [Nordic Stonewalls](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57686) . Please give them some kudos!
  
  
ABOUT THE MOD:
  
  
Have you ever noticed that every single campfire in Skyrim is the same? Which poor bandit is traveling the whole of Skyrim building every single fire? Or is there a Nordic University course that taught everyone to make the same campfire? I mean, where are the tee-pees? Or the log cabins? The lean-tos or the stars? I had no idea that was what all the different types of campfires were called until I began making this mod, BTW. Anyway, using assets from the awesome [Embers XD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37085), I've built over thirty campfires you'll now see on your travels around Skyrim. There are different constructions of campfire (varied logs and styles) and different rock placements; in forested areas, you're more likely to find mossy rocks (featuring textures from [Nordic Stonewalls](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57686)) around campfires; some have big rocks, and others are smaller. Campfires re-roll on save load, so if you revisit an area later in your playthrough, the campfire will likely have changed, as it would in real life.
  
  
This mod wouldn't be possible without the magic of [Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805) by [powerofthree](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/2148728). Please make sure you have the latest version installed, you've endorsed the mod, and you've given [powerofthree](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/2148728) some well-deserved kudos.
  
  
  
INSTALLATION:
  
  
1).  [Embers XD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37085) is a requirement to use this mod. Without installing the Embers XD first, you won't have any textures for your campfires. My mod only contains meshes, textures for the mossy rocks, and the files required by BOS. Install  [Embers XD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37085) first. Endorse that mod (it's fantastic!) and give [mindflux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3211380) some kudos.
  
  
2). Install my mod. It contains an esl flagged esp for the campfire records, a BOS SWAP file to initiate the swaps and the meshes required for the different campfires.
  
  
3). Enjoy!
  
  
4) While [Nordic Stonewalls](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57686) isn't a requirement, as Mindflux kindly allowed me to include textures from the mod, I HIGHLY recommend installing it. In my opinion, it's the most realistic stonewall mod on the Nexus. 
  
  
  
Q and As
  
  
Q) Is this compatible with X or Y mod?
  
  
A) As this mod replaces the campfire meshes, it's incompatible with any mod that does the same. Overwrite any other mods when you install this one to have the campfire variants. 
  
  
COMPATIBILITY.
  
The mod is compatible with: [Campfire - Complete Camping System (Supports Skyrim VR)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/667) and [Usable Unlit Campfires - A Campfire Addon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/108712) as they don't use the campfire01burning.nif for their fires. Compatible with  [FYX - Campfire Reacts to the Wind - EmbersXD Edition](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/103807), and [Inferno - Fire Effects Redux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29316).
  
  
It's NOT currently compatible with Embers HD. 
  
  
Q) How about Rain Extinguishes Fires?
  
  
A) I don't use Rain Extinguishes Fires, but I'd love to know if this works with it. Please let me know in the comments.
