**Did you know that horse carriages can ride through walls and fly?**
  
I know, because i saw it directly infront of me! Its magic, crafted in the deepest corners of the College of Winterhold and its sooooo beautiful...
  
  
**I know, i know, why remove it when you can look at something so beautiful?**
  
BECAUSE I HATE HORSES AND THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO FLY WHEN I CAN'T. HORSES CAN'T STAND ABOVE ME, BE IT ABILITY WISE OR LOOK WISE >:(
  
  
  
Here are the patches that bring the Horses back to the place where they belong.
  
On the streets where peasants belong!
  
  
HAVE FUN :D
