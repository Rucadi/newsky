﻿**Boats - Operational Animated Travel**

For when you want to take ✨The Scenic Route✨

Vanilla rowboats are a little boring. Most of them do nothing at all, and all the interactive ones simply teleport you directly to your destinations. Boring. 
  
Now, (\*some\*) rowboats actually move. Immersion!
  
  
If you dislike waiting, this mod is not for you. BE WARNED
