# Fires Hurt - OIF
- Author: kuroishitam
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/157720


This mod is a remake of a mod with the same name, Fires Hurt SE, using OIF to make this mod works both on SE and latest AE. As far as i know, the latest Fires Hurt NG doesn't support the latest Skyrim AE 1.61170 yet, so i made this mod. The feature is the same as the original mod:
  

  
* You get burnt and damaged while walking near fire sources like campfire, giant campfire, etc.
You get damaged and get magicka regen if you walk into magic pillar in winterhold. 
  
* You get scalded and damaged if you go near steam in eastmarch area.

The difference from other mod is you can add compatibility with other mod that add fire source using FLM. Check EmberXD FLM file for example. This only works for fire source with collision. For fire sources without collision, you need to create a dummy mesh and add that to the place. This is the downside of this mod.

**Installation:**1. Install the requirement OIF minimum v.1.6.7 and Formlist manipulator
  
2. Install this mod and put this mod esp early on your load order
  
  
Limitation: Due to how OIF works, i need to do some workaround to make this mod works. Here is the detail if you are interested:
  
Spoiler
  
OIF works by detecting collision of an object. This mod works flawlessly with fire sources with collision such as campfire, fireplaces, fire on the sconces. I don't need to make a workaround in this case. The only exception is with giantcampfire, although it has a collision, somehow the event can't work, so i need to make a workaround by adding a dummy object in everyplace where there is a giantcampfire. This is a bug or maybe engine limitation, i have asked OIF author about this and there isn't solution for this issue yet. It is also the same case for steam and magic pillar, i also put a dummy object to every places that has the steam. Consider this as a cheap price to make this mod possible.
