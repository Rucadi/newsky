"Goldenglow is a large estate and apiary outside Riften-"
  
I found *four whole bees* while working on this. 
  
The entire location feels half-finished and frankly, lazily done at that. For being a protected business, there are no meaningful walls. There are few true vantage points to watch over the *four bees* with. There really isn't anything notable.
  
No longer are there four bees. No longer are the islands unwalled.
  
And no longer can you enter from pretty much anywhere once the invisible walls are disabled. New ways are introduced while some old ways are removed.
  
The location feels more alive, and allows for more areas to hide while sneaking around the islands in search of those bees and their homes.[/font]

  
  
  

[font=Georgia]A Special Thank you﻿
  
A very special friend of mine who encouraged me to start modding.
  
Those who have helped encourage me, helped with feedback, and supported my work, thank you.
  
Without you, I do not think this project would continue.
  
As always, I love you, and happy modding.
