[Notes]
  
- Dialog is appear only while NPC is hired as follower.
  
- To prevent unintentional death, if the target health is less than 60 the dialog will not be appear.
  
- If you married with the target, the content of the conversation will change to a special one.
  
- Whoever will not get infected with Vampirism by feeding.
  
- F﻿eeding animation seems not play when there is major height difference between player and follower.
  
  (Details about the issue are explained [here](https://sites.google.com/site/bettervampires/faq/feeding-animation-issues)﻿)
  
  
[Troubleshooting]
  
Q. What should I do after biting an NPC the animation just plays and nothing happens?
  
A. First of all, please use a method other than this mod to feed.
  
  
 Similarly nothing happens: 
  
 If you are using or have used Better Vampires, You probably need to reset the scripts of vampire system.
  
 Try to reinstall/uninstall it using the proper procedure [here](https://sites.google.com/site/bettervampires/troubleshooting).
  
  
 It works fine:
  
 You may have selected not suitable esp when installing this mod. Please check again.
  
  
 I know this is technical, but the function of player side relies on PlayerVampireScript, so it's all about getting the script to work correctly for solve (= This mod itself is almost never the cause of the issue).
  
  
[Compatibility]
  
Scripts only work during conversations, so the system is conflict-free!
  
This mod is compatible with the following:
