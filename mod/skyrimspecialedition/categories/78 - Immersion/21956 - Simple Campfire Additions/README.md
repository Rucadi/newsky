This mod adds a variety of new items under the Create Item power to add to the camping experience.
  
  
Current Additions:
  
- Common Chair
  
- Common Table
  
- Archery Target
  
- Grindstone
  
- Workbench
  
- Anvil
  
- Practice Dummy
  
  
Will consider adding more based on personal preference and suggestions.
  
  
Known issues:
  
When first placing certain items you may become stuck in the center of an invisible outline of the placeable object and must jump to free yourself. Only really noticeable when placing large objects such as the table and workbench. If anyone knows how to fix this let me know, but it appears that even default Campfire placeables have this invisible collison however due to their small size its not really noticeable. 
  
  
Future plans:
  
- Traps
  
- Barricades
