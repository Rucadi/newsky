[font=Georgia]**Description**
  
[Honed Metal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61015)﻿ is a wonderfully immersive mod that allows the player to commission gear, upgrades, and enchanting services from Skyrim's craftsmen without having to invest in those skills yourself. But of course, all craftsmen need materials to complete their work. The player can bring the required materials along to their order, or pay additional fees for the craftsman to find everything themselves.
  
  
The materials that Honed Metal's blacksmiths and enchanters have access to (that the player need not supply) are determined by two FormLists in its plugin. One list contains items typical to each craft (such as ore, ingots, and filled soul gems), while the other has any more peculiar or illicit items which the craftsmen would probably have to go out of their way to acquire.
  
  
Any items not on the lists at all, however, must be brought by the player for the order to be completed.
  
  
The latest update to Honed Metal on the SE Nexus (v1.26+) finally includes **most** of the items originally added to these lists by [Grimolfr's patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35204)﻿ and the updated versions I've provided on this page! This includes common & rare materials from the Dawnguard and Dragonborn DLCs, as well as items such as creature ingredients and gemstones that are not used for crafting armor/weapons in the vanilla game but would make sense for an NPC to be able to obtain. Many mods require such irregular items in order to craft special gear or weapons.
  
  
As such, the updated patch provided here has been significantly downsized, but it still adds a handful of items to Honed Metal's materials lists that I felt were at least somewhat worthwhile, particularly some items from the Hearthfire DLC. 
  
  
Once/if these get added to Honed Metal as well, I may change this patch page into one supporting [SkyPatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106659)﻿ or **[FormList Manipulator](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74037)﻿**configs for non-vanilla materials added by mods that it would make sense for Honed Metal craftsmen to have access to, but that's still just a consideration for now.
  
  
  
**Installation**
  
It's just an ESL-flagged ESP (ESPFE). Install it like any other.
  
If installing on an existing game that already has Honed Metal installed,
  
it may be necessary to go in the MCM and refresh the material lists.
  
  
  
**That's it! Stay safe and have fun.**
