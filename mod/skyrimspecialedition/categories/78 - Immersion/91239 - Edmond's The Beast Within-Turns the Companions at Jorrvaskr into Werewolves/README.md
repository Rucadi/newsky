Doesn't it seem odd that the Companions are all known to be werewolves but you only see them in their werewolf form  twice? This mod aims to immersively fix this issue by seamlessly integrating with the main game. Once one of the companions (Aela, Farkas, or Vilkas) are near death and bleeding out, they will turn into a werewolf and unleash the beast on your enemies. After they have spent their energy they will naturally turn back into humans and equip their armor themselves. They will not be able to turn into a werewolf again until they have recovered their strength.
  
  
**Some Questions People May Ask**

  
* Is it ESL? Yup
What about compatibility I want to have a custom Aela etc? Got you covered with SPID making this mod compatible with everything
  
* But what if I don't want to use SPID? Got you covered with a non-SPID version just load it after any mod altering the Companions
Can I install mid save? Yes
  
* Risk? None and its AE, SE, and VR compatible
Bugs? None.

All companions specifically Farkas, Vilkas, and Aela can transform into werewolves. You can select in the installer to have a 2 in game day, 1 in game day, or no cooldown for their transformations. Transformations will last 3 minutes. Aela, Farkas, and Vilkas will not transform until the quest Proving Honor is complete which is the quest you see Farkas transform for the first time. This is for lore friendly consistency. Once Farkas and Vilkas are cured of lycanthropy Farkas and Vilkas will no longer transform. The mod is AE, SE, and VR compatible. You can select from a version that requires SPID and a version that doesn't and includes new faces for the Companions see screenshots for details.
  
  
Additionally, the Companions will not transform in any major hold. Additionally a spell was added to the game in a lore friendly way hidden in Klodaks room. You will get the spell yourself when the time comes in the main quest (unless you steal it) and a journal entry about it can be found. It will turn Aela back into a human on command when she is a werewolf via calming her inner spirit.

-Only Skyrim is Required (Any Version)
  
-Install on a Existing Game or a New Game
  
-If you use the Main file that integrates with the mod [Diverse Werewolf Collection](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7009) then you need that mod too
  
  
**NOTE:** Mods that change Aela's name for any reason will prevent SPID from working. All you have to do is go into the SPID file of this mod and update Aela's name to match the name you use in your game that's all. This most likely will affect people with a translation mod that changes her name.
