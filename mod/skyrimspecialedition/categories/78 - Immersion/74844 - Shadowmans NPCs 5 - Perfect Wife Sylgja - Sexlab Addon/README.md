New voice.
  
My immense gratitude goes to "mortified anonymous helper" who generated the audio.
  
=====================================
  
  
This mod has two parts. One romantic and one extra, optional, kinky part.
  
It requires you to be married to Sylgja (Duh!). For a male character.
  
  
Features:
  
-You can tell Sylgja you love her, random replies (42 lines).
  
-You can ask Sylgja to cook for you.
  
-You can give her flowers.
  
-Random idle greetings with romantic lines from Sylgja (125 lines).
  
-Very mild lines leading to intimate scenes (37 random lines) (doggy/missionary/cowgirl, anal, bj, Cun, tj, fj, kissing)
  
-Random idle greetings from Annekke, telling you what a great son-in-law you are. Only active if she is NOT your follower. (50 lines)
  
  
Now the kinky stuff (Optional)
  
-Ask Sylgja about her favorite fantasy. You can reject it or accept moving forward with it. If you accept:
  
-Bring a female follower to your house when your wife Sylgja is present. 
  
-Just for the hell of it, i added some random comments from Sylgja if the follower you bring is:
  
Lydia, Uthgerd, Serana, Annekke. Generic comments for anyone else. 47 comments total.
  
-You can ask Sylgja to join you for a threesome or ask her to watch you do your follower. About 70 random comments from Sylgja.
  
-Intro Scene for Annekke leading to sex with her.
  
-Lines to initiate sex scenes with Annekke (15 lines)
  
  
Sylgja is my favorite Skyrim wife but i understand other people have their favorites and this mod is not for everyone.
  
Fellow Sylgja fans, i hope you like it.
