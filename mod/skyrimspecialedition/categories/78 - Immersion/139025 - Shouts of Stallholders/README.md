Have you ever noticed that the Skyrim market stall sellers say the same two or three lines over and over again, all day and every day? Well not any more! This mod adds new lines for all vanilla market traders plus support for mod-added NPCs that are set up as market traders with vanilla voice types.
  
  
**Overview of the features;**
  
  

  
* Each unique marketplace NPC has unique lines appropriate to their location and type of goods they sell
More generic comments both for unique NPCs and any outdoor trader with a vanilla voice type
  
* Adds lines for the three market sellers in Raven Rock on Solstheim (they don't have any in vanilla)
Highly compatible
  
* Lightweight, script free and ESL flagged
Feature to block any NPC from the mod via SPID
  

  
**Installation**
  
Simply install like you would any other mod using your favourite mod manager. Safe to install mid-game and*probably* safe to uninstall.
  
  
**Configuration**
  
If there's an NPC you want to block from saying the lines for some reason, you can assign them a keyword using SPID.
  
  
Simply open the file called **Shouts of Stallholders\_DISTR.ini** and add the NPC's name to the list. 
  
  
Just edit the line Keyword = JB1DoNotShout| and add the NPC(s) to the list, using a comma to separate them. For example if you want Anoriath and Carlotta to stop saying the lines from the mod, add their names using a comma to separate them, like this Keyword =JB1DoNotShout|Carlotta,Anoriath. Note this will not block them from saying their vanilla lines, just the lines added by this mod.
  
  
**FAQs / Notes**
  
**Does it work with AE?**
  
The mod was made with the older version of the Creation Kit so it's compatible with all versions of Skyrim SE/AE.
  
  
**LE version?**
  
[Markus79](http://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Markus179?gameId=110) backported some of my mods.
  
**Is it compatible with....?**
  
Most likely, yes. If you're using a mod that suppresses idle comments then it may affect this mod. Other than that, all this mod does is add a few new voice lines.
  
  
**Can I translate it and release it?**
  
Yes translations are fine as long as they require the original mod.
  
  
**Does it work with town mods or other mods that add new NPCs?**
  
It will work with any mod that adds NPCs with vanilla voice types that are supported as merchants and that are in the JobMerchantFaction. Their comments will only trigger when they are outdoors between 9am and 6pm. It will not work with any NPC that has a custom voice type.
  
  
**Can you add my (no doubt hilarious) line?**
  
No.
  
  
**How frequent are the comments?**
  
Most comments are set to repeat every hour. For comparison, the vanilla comments are set to repeat around every 30 minutes.
  
  
**Note -** Due to the way his dialogue is handled, Brynjolf is not included in the mod.
  
  
**I don't like 'AI' generated voices!**That's your choice, don't use the mod
  

  
  

Polite notice - if you ask a question that is already covered in the description or the FAQ section, it will most likely be ignored and/or removed. But let's face it, you won't have read this bit anyway.
