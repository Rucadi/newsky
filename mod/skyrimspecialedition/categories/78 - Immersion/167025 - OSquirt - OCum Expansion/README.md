This mod adds 2 new squirt effects and overhauls all the squirt sounds as well.
  
  
Thanks to [ff7legend](https://forums.nexusmods.com/profile/3743885-ff7legend/) for helping me fix the ESL flag issue and other things. Without him I probably would not have figured the issue out.
  
  
I am not adding audio samples, if you want to hear the sounds, manually download the mod and open it up and listen to the .wavs.
  
  
2 new squirt events
  
 ﻿Original - Flow
  
 ﻿Original - Spurt
  
 ﻿New - Gush
  
 ﻿New - Stream
  
All sounds have been overhauled and added new sounds.
  
They all are real sounds; I had to go and get them myself.
  
  
Future Plans:
  
 ﻿Add more events, Creating my own new effects. (Need to learn how to first).
  
 ﻿Add a puddle system or decals
  
If anyone has more ideas or suggestions, let me know!
  
  
All credit goes to the Creator of the mod OCum Ascended as I did not create the script, I only added the events.
  
  
I did make the new sounds and add the 2 new effects. Credit for the effects go to the maker of the Zaz Animation pack.
  
  
Make sure this mod Overrides OCum or loads after, and a New Game or New Save is REQUIRED!  Otherwise, the script and quest that runs the mod will not update and work properly. Make sure and have all the requirements.
  
  
If any bugs or issues please report them, so I can fix if possible!
