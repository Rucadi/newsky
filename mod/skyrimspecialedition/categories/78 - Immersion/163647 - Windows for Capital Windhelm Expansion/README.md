I like Capital Windhelm Expansion, now it has another layer of cosiness
  
  
some few black holes remain because windows would need to be to added to the building meshes, and also, apart from that, those meshes are curved, so..
  
  
  
Similar mod but for Markarth
  
[Markarth has Windows](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/145699/)
  
And. Similar mod for [High Hrothgar](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/165280/) 
  
And... [Windows for Whiterun and Solitude](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/165492/)
  
  
I recommend you use well known Capital of Windhelm mod fixes out there
