[font=bebas\_neuebook]Following a deity[/font]
  
  
Whenever you use a shrine, a dialog box appears, allowing you to become a *Follower*of that deity. Followers receive a subtle gift, the **Pray**power, and a list of religious tenets. Some deities can only be worshipped by certain races or after completing a quest.
  
  
Adhering to the tenets, praying, and worshipping at their shrine will raise your favor with your deity. Upon reaching **100**%, you become a *Devotee*and receive a second gift that is a dramatic manifestation of the deity's power on Tamriel. Ignoring your religious duties or violating their taboos will cause your favor with the deity to gradually diminish. If favor drops to **0**%, the deity will abandon you.
  
  
You can only worship one deity at a time.
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Prayer and worship[/font]
  
  
Use the **Pray**power to kneel and enter a meditative state, raising your favor and displaying your current favor. While you can pray as often as you wish, praying at least once a day is sufficient to raise your favor as fast as possible; there is no additional benefit to repeatedly praying in quick succession or praying for long amounts of time. Some deities may restrict prayer to specific times or locations.
  
  
You can also worship at the shrine of your deity. Worship is equivalent to prayer, but raises favor by a larger amount.
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Your starting religion[/font]
  
  
At the start of your playthrough (after the intro sequence or when you reach level 2, same as Survival Mode), a dialog box appears, allowing you to choose a deity based on your race. This represents the religion your character followed before they arrived in Skyrim.
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Temptations[/font]
  
  
Although visiting their shrine is the most common way to become a follower of a deity, there are other ways. In particular, when you interact with a Daedric Prince during a quest or read about their deeds of might and glory, the Daedric Prince may offer you to immediately become their follower, regardless of your race or other requirements.
  
  
Should you decline the Temptation, the Daedric Prince will not ask again, so choose wisely. *(If you decline, you can still become a follower of the Daedric Prince by visiting their shrine.)*
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Holy relics[/font]
  
  
Rare lost artifacts of holy or unholy power exist that will improve your relationship with your deity...
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]The Nine Divines[/font]
  
  
The Divines welcome any who would worship them into the fold, no matter their race or previous deities. Divine favor is slow to build, but the Divines are merciful and their faithful are unlikely to fall out of favor, unless they overtly commit crimes or ignore their religious duties for a long period of time.

[font=bebas\_neuebook]The Daedric princes[/font]
  
  
Most Daedric Princes only accept the worship of those they deem worthy of their attention. Gaining favor is not too challenging, as long as one is willing to commit unsavoury acts, but favor also diminishes faster. As a result, prayer alone is not enough to reach devotee status and Daedra worshippers must actively follow their tenets to build up favor. There is no such thing as paying lip service to a Daedric Prince!

[/color][/size]

[font=bebas\_neuebook]The Khajiiti pantheon[/font]
  
  
The Khajiit worship many deities, most of which are different aspects of the Divines and Daedric Princes, but they also have several deities that represent their own challenges and unique role in the world.

[font=bebas\_neuebook]Anniversary Edition[/font]
  
  
To integrate the new shrines added by the Creation Club content in the Skyrim Anniversary Edition (specifically the Ghosts of the Tribunal and Gallow's Hall Creations), use [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58988) (thanks to NovaCoru).
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Compatibility[/font]
  
  
See [here](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/962/?) for a list of (in)compatible mods.
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Installation[/font]
  
  
This mod can be installed during a playthrough. Add the mod to your load order and activate it. Note that if you are next to a vanilla non-functional shrine that is turned into a functional shrine by this mod (Azura, Hircine, Peryite) when you install the mod, you may experience graphical glitches because loaded objects can't be moved or disabled. This will fix itself after a cell reset.
  
  
This mod can be removed during a playthrough. Make sure you are not worshipping Arkay or Kynareth and don't have a shrine blessing active, then remove the mod.
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]FAQ[/font]
  
  

  
* **The dialog to follow a Divine does not show up when I activate their shrine** You have another mod that modifies shrine blessings and is loaded after Wintersun.[/\*]
**My favor keeps going down:** Make sure you are praying at least once every 24 hours. A reminder notification appears 24 hours after your last prayer session. Note that favor depletes much faster in versions of Wintersun before 3.0.0, especially for Daedric Princes.[/\*]
  
* **I spam pray but my favor barely increases:** Praying at least once every 24 hours is sufficient to gain the maximum amount of favor from praying. Praying more often than that does not yield more favor.[/\*]
**I heard you can only worship a deity once / I got abandoned, did I lose the deity forever:** Incorrect. You can follow a deity at their shrine an unlimited number of times, even if the deity abandons you. Some Daedric Princes will offer you to follow them immediately when you read about them, and this can only occur once, but if you decline, you can always follow them at their shrine at a later time.[/\*]
  
* **Abilities are excessively strong / I do far too much damage / this mod is OP:**  This mod uses the "VoicePoints" and "VoiceRate" unused actor values to implement favor scaling, and having another mod that uses these actor values in your load order will result in a conflict. The outcome of such a conflict is that follower abilities and/or shrine blessings are much more powerful than the ability description claims.[/\*]
**How do I use "during prayer" abilities such as Stendarr's Channel Divinity:**  While praying, a luminous glow appears in front of you. Activate it with the Activate button, like opening a chest.[/\*]
  
* **How do I use "activate a target in combat" abilities such as Meridia's Supreme Light:**  In melee range, activate the target with the Activate button, like opening a chest.[/\*]
**Can I worship multiple deities:**  No. Implementing this would require removing most forms of favor scaling, and if you can worship several deities, each of them would need a major nerf, making it pointless to worship just one (or any less than 50). Lore wise, while commoners may worship "the nine", clergy are typically dedicated to one deity only.[/\*]
  
* **My favor is stuck at 0%:** If you use the MCM to disable abandonment, your favor can become negative, which is displayed as 0% because many worshipper abilities scale with favor and would become drawbacks at negative favor. Either gain enough favor to get back above 0%, or disable the MCM option to get abandoned and return to their shrine to follow them again with a fresh 15% favor.[/\*]
