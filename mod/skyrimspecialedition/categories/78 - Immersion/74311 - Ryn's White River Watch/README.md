Ryn's White River Watch
  
  
[/font][font=Georgia]Home to an aspiring bandit-king, Hajvarr Iron-Hand, White River Watch is already a unique location.
  
The named bandit chief has fun lore with a decent dungeon, but is dreadfully similar to other generic bandit chiefs. He has nothing setting him apart in terms of being more difficult, despite having unique loot and a name.
  
On top of that, he keeps a bow in his inventory that seems to override his intended AI combat patterns. So the fight is incredibly easy since he refuses to use his greatsword as he's intended to unless you walk backwards with him while staying in his face, forcing him to take a sword out. Even then, he will attempt to run from you to use the bow.
  
No longer is that the case.
  
Having removed the low-level bow from his inventory, he will no longer suffer from his AI choosing the vastly lower damage option.
  
His base stats have all been increased to give him a boost, and he's gained multiple two-handed and heavy armor perks to improve his damage and survivability. Though it's his damage you'll need to be wary of.
  
The walkway up to the cave has been extended, as to enhance the vertical fight Bethesda aimed to design. And the peak at which Hajvarr Iron-Hand watches over Whiterun, taunting the guards, an ancient Nord tower now stands and is used as a home to the newly-buffed bandit chief.[/font]
