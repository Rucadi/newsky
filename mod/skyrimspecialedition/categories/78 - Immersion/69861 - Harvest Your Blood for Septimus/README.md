> ﻿"The sealing structure interlocks in the tiniest fractals. Dwemer blood can loose the hooks, but none alive remain to bear it. A panoply of their brethren could gather to form a facsimile. A trick. Something they didn't anticipate, no, not even them. The blood of Altmer, Bosmer, Dunmer, Falmer, and Orsimer. The elves still living provide the key."

I don't often play elves in Skyrim, so I have always assumed that you were able to harvest your own blood for Septimus Signus during [Discerning the Transmundane](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Discerning_the_Transmundane). Imagine my surprise when I found out that wasn't the case, you can only harvest blood from dead elves. Why is this the case if I just happen to have some relevant blood coursing through my veins?
  
  
This small mod allows you to use your own blood for the quest, simply activate the Essence Extractor in your inventory and you will fulfill the quest objective to collect the relevant blood type!

* Allows for you to harvest your own blood for Septimus Signus if you are a Dark Elf, High Elf, Orc, or Wood Elf.
Built-in support for the Dwemer and Falmer races from [Lost Races of Nirn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69467)﻿﻿ (yes, [Dwemer works the way you think it does](https://youtu.be/aI0GywTy1hY)﻿).
  
* Includes an optional addon that allows you to ask NPCs if you can have a sample of their blood. They will reject you unless you are at least RelationshipRank 3 with them.
Very unintrusive, the quest is entirely unedited and only a single vanilla record is affected.
