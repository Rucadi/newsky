 Ryn's Azura's Shrine
  
  
[/font][font=Georgia]As an important location in the Elder Scrolls universe, Azura's shrine should be more notable. It should be enjoyable to walk to. It should support the idea that hundreds of Dunmer traveled here, lived here, and soon enough abandoned it, leaving behind only one.
  
Instead, there is a bed, some boxes, and a lady who would surely freeze sleeping at the peak of a mountain.
  
Now with an undercroft beneath the statue to act as housing for Azura's patrons, Aranea Ienith, this is no longer an issue.
  
Along with a new, short but semi difficult dungeon to go along with it all.[/font]

[/font][font=Georgia]A Special Thank you﻿
  
A very special friend of mine who encouraged me to start modding.
  
Those who have helped encourage me, helped with feedback, and supported my work, thank you.
  
Without you, I do not think this project would continue.
  
As always, I love you, and happy modding.
