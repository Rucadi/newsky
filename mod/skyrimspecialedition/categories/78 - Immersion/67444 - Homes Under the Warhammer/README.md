This mod isn't complex, and was mainly made for my own game so I won't be accepting any requests related to it, I also do not plan to make a FOMOD, so please don't ask. Details of the changes are as follows:
  
  
**Bloodchill Manor**
  
- Quest initiates after completing Awakening, the quest plays out as normal.
  
  
**Gallows Hall**
  
- Quest initiates after completing Conjuration Ritual Spell, the quest plays out as normal.
  
  
**Hendraheim**
  
- Quest initiates after completing Glory of the Dead, the quest plays out as normal.
  
**Myrwatch**
  
- The house must be unsealed by acquiring an enchanted note from a specific fisherman (***Requires Fishing***)
  
  
**Shadowfoot Sanctum**
  
- Puchase requires being Guildmaster of the Thieves Guild.
  
  
**Tundra Homestead**
  
- Purchase requires completion of Dragon Rising
  
  
**Not Included**
  
  
**Nchuanthumz**
  
- I had no thoughts on how I would want to limit this, and its location and implementation means that it is easy to just ignore unless you want it.
  
  
**Dead Man's Dread**
  
- The quest for this one is fairly substantial, I didn't see the need to edit it to add other requirements.
  
  
**Farming**
  
- I was going to make something to do with buying after the first quest, but [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69029) by AndrealphusVIII is a much better version of that, so I would recommend you use that instead
