**This is a  resource pack for modders,  containing**   meshes of Toussaint rhododendrons, Toussaint roses, grapevines, sunflowers, and Novigrad hedges.
  
  
Plants are animated like vanilla flora and should be configured in the  "Tree" category of  Creation Kit.
  
  
Sunflowers have the harvest functionality as well. The ingredient model is included in the pack.
  
  
The rose color variants are exactly matched to the  roses from The Witcher 2, providing compatibility with the **"Plantable Roses of Remembrance"** mod.
