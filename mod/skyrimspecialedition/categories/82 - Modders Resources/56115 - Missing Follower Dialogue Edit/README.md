**Description**
  
  
The following voice types did not have proper follower dialogue. As such, I made dialogue for them.
  
  
[Here's an overview of all Vanilla voice types in an Excel sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K-urWne35UmdxW1jK8nRMOoUSvZpCEGP-yJOuNeNKYk/edit?usp=sharing).
  
  
This mod also includes lines for Female Khajiit marriage, from [the LE version of RDO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/74568). (thanks to cloudedtruth)
  
  
Lastly, I included an optional BAT file which can make any NPC into a follower. Put this file in your main Skyrim Special Folder, NOT the data folder. If this is done, open the console and target the NPC. Then use the console command:
  
  

```
bat makefollower
```

  
This will put the NPC in the correct faction and sets the correct relationshiprank to become a follower.

**FAQ**
  
  
Q: <insert question about anything related to RDO or one of its many versions>
  
A: I'm no longer updating or maintaining them. I have to draw the line somewhere to keep my sanity.
  
  
Q: Do the unique voice followers no longer get made into followers when their questlines are done?
  
A: I'm including the scripts to make them into followers in [BUVARP SE RE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56120). (adding the Potential follower faction and setting the relationshiprank) Optionally I also included a BAT file, which allows you to make them into followers. I did this as I want Missing Follower Dialogue Edit remain a resource for missing voice lines, as an addition to my other mods.
  
  
Q: ESPFE?
  
A: Yes.
  
  
Q: Does installing/updating/uninstalling on an existing save work?
  
A: As far as I know, it should. However, it's good practice to keep a backup save prior to doing this, just in case.
  
  
Q: Is this compatible with <insert mod>?
  
A: I don't know by heart. You might need to check yourself.
  
  
Q: Will you make a patch for <insert mod>?
  
A: Only if it's a mod I use myself or plan on using, I have enough time and I actually like the idea. Otherwise, feel free to do it yourself. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: I have a suggestion to improve the mod. Can you do it?
  
A: Maybe, if I have time and I like the idea, I'll consider it.
  
  
Q: Will you port this to <insert platform>?
  
A: No, I myself only support the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If someone else wants to port it, feel free. (see permission) If you decide to port it, you yourself take full responsibility to offer support to said port. I will not provide no support for any ports by third parties.
  
  
Q: I use a ported version of this mod on <insert platform> and I have a problem. Can you help?
  
A: I don't provide any support for third party ports on other platforms than the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If you have issues, you should adress the person that ported it.
  
  
Q: Does this work on Skyrim 1.6+, aka "Anniversary Edition"?
  
A: Yes, it should.
  
  
Q: Why don't your mods use MCMs and instead use this janky console command system to set globals?
  
A: I am not a fan of MCMs. You can set the globals by making a patch in xEdit. I have no plans of changing this. If you want to add an MCM, feel free. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: Why don't you use FOMODs?
  
A: That would require reuploading the entire mod, in question, even if I only make a small change. My internet is limited and reuploading the files each time will take a huge chunk of my monthly volume.
