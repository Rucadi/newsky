When it comes to triggering the feed effect on vampires many overhauls are giving the mod author a hard time.
  
So I created this proxy script with a consistent API to be able to trigger the feeding without having to bother with checking for vampire overhauls.
  
  
**Supported Overhauls**Better Vampires, Sacrosanct and Sacrilege have their own option in the fomod installer.
  
Scion and Vampire Configuration Menu are compatible with the vanilla version.
