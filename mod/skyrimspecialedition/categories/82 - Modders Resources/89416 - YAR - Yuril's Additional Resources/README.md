> **Also I changed the modality of use of my resources**These resources are of course free for everyone, I offer my few skills so I would like that if you use these resources in your mods, put the "mandatory file" when uploading your mod. Like you already do with other mods when you have dependencies.

* Yuril's Extra Resources is a big pack of new 3D models (mainly Architectural) that you can freely use in your mods. it will be updated regularly. (every time I work on something there is always a way to make it a resource for everyone) For the moment you will find meshes like Solitude, Riften, Whiterun, Markarth, Windhelm, Stockade and Statue

  

* You can find in the Misc Files an ESP (YAR - ESP) with all the new mesh entries and a new world space to directly see the resources in game. To get there, in the main menu open the Console Commands and type **COC** **YARORIGIN.** (*Simply used to observe new meshes quickly in game*)

  

* Modders, If you want to save time with these resources and start modding quickly without spending hours entering references for new meshes, use the ESP (YAR - ESP - Base For Modding) in the Misc' files. Rename it with the name of your future mod.

  
  
  
If you see any bugs or anything, let me know so I can fix it. :)
  
  
  
Enjoy !
