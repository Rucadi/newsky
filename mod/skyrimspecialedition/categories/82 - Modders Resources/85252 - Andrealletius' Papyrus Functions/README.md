**Description**
  
  
As MrowrPurr started doing a [YouTube tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTN9bAB2S9A&list=PLektTyeQhBZeDIRp2g15SsK1GX2Ig8YVW) on SKSE DLL development, I decided to dip my toes into it.
  
  
This resource is a collection of new native papyrus functions, achieved through the power of SKSE and CommonLibSSE NG.
  
For users: it doesn't actually do anything on its own, but it may be required for some mods that use any of its functions.
  
  
**The functions**
  
  
If you wish to use any of the following functions in a script, you'll need to use the line:
  
  

```
Import ANDR_PapyrusFunctions
```

  
You can find a list of the functions [here](https://ck.uesp.net/wiki/ANDR_PapyrusFunctions_Script).

A: Maybe eventually, but not right now.
  
  
Q: I have a suggestion to improve the mod. Can you do it?
  
A: Maybe, if I have time and I like the idea, I'll consider it.
  
  
Q: Will you port this to <insert other version of Skyrim>?
  
A: It requires SKSE and won't work on any platform that doesn't support SKSE.
  
  
Q: I have this cool idea. <insert idea> Will you add this?
  
A: Maybe. If I like it and doesn't take too much time/effort.
  
  
Q: Does this work on Skyrim 1.6+, aka "Anniversary Edition"?
  
A: ~~As far as I know, it *should*. I'm still on SE 1.5.97 myself so I don't know for sure.~~ ~~Apparently it still doesn't work with AE. I don't know why. If anyone could help me solve this, please do, as I'm baffled as to why.~~ It should work for AE now.
