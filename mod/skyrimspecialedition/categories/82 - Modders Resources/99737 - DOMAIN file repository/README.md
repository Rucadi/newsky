i dont really feel like making this description look cool or adding awesome pictures or anything lol
  
heres the collection: <https://next.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/collections/gnfjwh>
  
this page specifically contains outputs, lods, meshes, and whatever else. every single file within strictly requires all of the original mods and is thus completely worthless if you are not using my collection. other smaller files may be bundled with the collection in vortex, such as small inis and stuffs. i double checked within the nexus discord servers as well, all these files should be in the clear. 
  
  
i love you. all links to discord, patreon, kofi, whatever else are on the collection page above.
  
  
i would also like to briefly mention that my collection includes all of the bodyslide and face presets i've posted on my user page.
  
  
and the last thing i'd like to say is that i appreciate every single mod author that has made skyrim modding possible, the skyrim community is one of the best things i've ever been apart of and i wouldnt enjoy making collections nearly as much if i didnt have all of you creators and users.
  
  
bye!!!!!!!!!!
