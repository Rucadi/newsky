This is a collection of mostly repurposed Skyrim's UI elements to serve various functions. If you've been redirected here by another mod, simply install it like any other mod.
  
I had made some of these while making other stuff, and needed certain UI things for some others, so decided to bundle them all together, for easy updating and skinning.
  
  
  
**Load Order**
  
**Important**: Make sure to load this mod very early in your load order (at the top), let everything else override.
  
  
  
**What's in it**
  

  
* **QuantitySlider**: Opens a little window where you can select a number using slider. Example mods:
    
  [Poisoned Arrows](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/123585)﻿
**SelectList**: Copies the looks of vanilla Skyrim's Favorites menu, it displays a list of options and you can select one, which will close the menu. Example mods:
  
[Follower Inventory Quick Access](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/122419)﻿[Quick Item Transfer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/125160)﻿.* **ItemSelect**: Opens the inevntory menu, but activating an item will close the menu, and returns the formID of the selected item. Useful when you want to player to choose an item from their inventory. Can optionally filter by itemType as well so only items of specific type are displayed in the menu. Example:
    
  [Alchemical Appraisal Services](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/107344)﻿[Temper and Recharge Services](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/129279)﻿
**SpellSelect**: Similar to ItemSelect, but for spells. Opens the Magic menu, you select your desired spell and the menu closes, returning the formID of selected spell.
  
* **TrainingMenu**: Similar to vanilla's training menu but it can be used for training anything (like from Custom Skills Framework, or others). Examples:
    
  [Animunculi Override - Dwemer Automaton Hacking Minigame](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/114546)﻿ where the player can train a custom skill from CSF,[Skills Of The Wild Trainers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/128127/) ﻿where player can train skills from Campfire mod.
**Announcement**: Similar to notification messages, but with an accompanying icon. Example:
  
[Feeding Perk Notification](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/128242)﻿* **NotificationManager**: Can be used to supress specific notification messages, or optionally get an event callback when that notification shows up.
**Spinicon**: shows a spinning icon along with a customizable text in the bottom right corner of the screen. Example:
  
[Workbench Containers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/130090)* **Traits Menu**: Creates a menu similar to FO3/New Vegas's Traits menu.﻿

  
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
Should be compatible with everything, no changes to any vanilla records.
