# More Craftable Equipment - Unenchanted Clothing and Specialty Gear

Overview
  
  
Something I've found bothersome ever since I first played vanilla Skyrim is how limited you are in choosing the right clothing and armor for your character. Merchants might not always have the items you want in stock, so you have to keep waiting for their inventory to reset, until they get them. Some items have to be acquired by stealing or using exploits, and others are simply impossible to get. Some items only exist with enchantments already on them, which makes it impossible to customize them with your own Enchanting abilities.
  
  
This mod aims to remedy these problems by greatly expanding the selection of items that can be crafted. This includes the more "mundane" clothing, like farm clothes and chef clothes, but rarer and more specialized items will also become available as you progress in quests related to them.
  
  
The Weaving Loom
  
  
Since we are making clothing items craftable, we need a crafting station, which is where the **Weaving Loom** comes in. You can find these placed in a few select locations across Skyrim. See also the [Compatibility Guide for Mod Authors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/2750) for information on placing your own looms.
  
  
Weaving Loom locations:
  
**Radiant Raiment, Solitude** - At the back of the shop
  
**The Blue Palace, Solitude** - In the servants' quarters
  
**Dragonsreach, Whiterun** - In the room underneath the kitchen
  
**Palace of the Kings, Windhelm** - In the kitchen
  
**Understone Keep, Markarth** - At the top of the stairs between the kitchen and the Jarl's throne
  
**Raven Rock** - Fethis's shop at Alor House
  
  
New Equipment
  
  
Thieves Guild
  
Not only can you craft an unenchanted version of the standard **Thieves Guild Armor** set, you will also gain access to the alternative **Thieves Guild Cowl** and the **Thieves Guild Gray Sleeveless Armor** set once you become a member of the Thieves Guild. After completion of the quest Speaking With Silence, you will also be able to craft **Karliah's Armor** set. Once you become the leader of the Thieves Guild, you will be able to craft the **Thieves Guild Leader Armor** set.
  
  
Dark Brotherhood
  
In order to correct the inconsistency between the male and female versions of the **Shrouded Cowl** and **Ancient Shrouded Cowl**, these items will no longer have a mask regardless of your race or gender. You can now find a **Shrouded Masked Cowl** in the Falkreath Sanctuary, which is enchanted, or you can craft an unenchanted one at a forge. This special masked cowl *does* have a mask regardless of your race or gender (however, mind that it may clip with some beards and whiskers). You can now also craft the **Shrouded Short-Sleeved Armor**, the same armor that Arnbjorn wears. After completion of the quest The Cure for Madness, you will be able to craft the unenchanted **Jester's Clothes** set. All of the Dark Brotherhood equipment can be crafted whether you choose to join the Dark Brotherhood or destroy it.
  
  
Recommended mod: [RUSTIC ARMOR and WEAPONS](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19666) by Gamwich (Strongly recommended for the shoulder texture fix.)
  
  
Executioner
  
If you complete a favor for Ahtar, the executioner in Solitude, you will be able to craft the **Executioner's Robes** set as well as the **Headsman's Axe**. The Executioner set counts as Light Armor. The Headsman's Axe has longer range than a typical battleaxe. (Originally, this axe could only be acquired by taking it from Ahtar.)
  
  
Recommended mod: [RUSTIC CLOTHING](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4703) by Gamwich
  
  
Giant Clothes
  
If you defeat any Giants who are wearing clothes, you can now loot their equipment! You won't be able to wear it right away, but you can take it to a forge to refit it to human size. The items will count as Light Armor. This equipment set only has 3 pieces, but you can still get the Matching Set bonus as long as you are not wearing a helmet. The set does not offer especially good protection, but wearing all 3 pieces grants the **Giant's Strength** ability, which increases your attack damage by **25**%!
  
  
Recommended mod: [GIANT](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6179) by Kajuan (The UV maps have been tailored to ensure compatibility with this retexture.)
  
  
Tsun's Armor
  
After completion of the quest Dragonslayer, you can craft **Tsun's Armor** set at the **Skyforge**. The items will count as Heavy Armor. This equipment set only has 3 pieces, but you can still get the Matching Set bonus as long as you are not wearing a helmet. The set does not offer especially good protection, but wearing all 3 pieces grants the **Might of the Bear** ability, which increases your attack damage by **25**%!
  
  
Recommended mod: [aMidianBorn Tsun](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36336) by CaBaL (Only for the 4K version; the 2K version has already been included.)
  
  
Dragonbone Crown
  
After completion of the quest The Jagged Crown, you can craft a replica of the crown, called the **Dragonbone Crown** at the forge. It has to be made out of Dragon Bones, so you also need the Dragon Armor perk to make it!
  
  
Recommended mod: [Frankly HD Dragonbone and Dragonscale - Armor and Weapons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25110)
  
  
Recipe Tweaks
  
  
Armor formulas local to Solstheim (i.e. **Bonemold** and **Chitin**) will not appear until you have visited Solstheim. A few other "easter egg" items, such as the **Shellbug Helmet**, will also be hidden until you have acquired the appropriate items.
  
  
Clothing Tweaks
  
  
A few clothing items that were originally considered armor have been changed to function as clothing for the sake of convenience and consistency. This includes the **Fine Armguards** worn by Jarl Korir, the **Gilded Wristguards** that belong to the Emperor, **Ulfric's Armguards**, and the **Cultist**'s clothing from Solstheim. Some essential bugfixes on clothing items were also included in order to ensure that crafted items would function correctly (no surprises for Unofficial Patch users).
