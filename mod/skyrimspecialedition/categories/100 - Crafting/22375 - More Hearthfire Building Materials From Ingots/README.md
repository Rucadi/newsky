# More Hearthfire Building Materials From Ingots

This mod allows you to build more iron fittings, hinges, nails, and locks per iron and corundum ingot.
  
  
The Hearthfire homes are very nice, but take an excessive amount of iron ingots to build. This aims to fix that.
  
  
The main file is x2. So now 1 iron ingot will make 2 iron fittings instead of just 1, and so on.
  
  
There are optional files for x3 and x4, as well as ESPFE versions of each file that do not count towards the load order limit. Choose ONLY ONE file.
