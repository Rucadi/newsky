**Adds balanced experience gain to smelting and leatherworking in a compatible and lightweight way.**
  
  
  
**Features:**
  
  
*- Smelting now grants experience (with a 50% experience penalty)
  
- Leatherworking now grants experience (with a 30% experience penalty)*
  
  
  
**Compatibility:**
  
Fully compatible with all mods, including those like [Ars Metallica](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/321) that already add experience gain.
  
This mod will then apply an experience penalty to smelting/leatherworking and ensure compatibility with mods introducing new crafting stations.
  
  
Patches are available for mods that add additional crafting stations. (Requires [FormList Manipulator - FLM](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74037)﻿)
