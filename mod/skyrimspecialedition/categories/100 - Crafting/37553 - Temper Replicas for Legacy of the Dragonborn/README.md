Hey, I have a **[Discord](https://discord.gg/Vvcnv5kA2F)﻿**now! 
  
  
This add on:
  

  
* Resets the values of the weapon and armor replicas in Legacy of the Dragonborn to the base values of their material keyword\*. So if a sword has the steel keyword, it will have the stats/value of a steel sword.
Adds tempering recipes so you can improve the weapons and armor which take advantage of your smithing perks.
  
* Corrected some issues found with Legacy replicas.

  
With the proper smithing buffs you should be able to make any of these replicas viable for end game play (doubly so if you're using a decent perk overhaul).
  
  

  
* Optional patch now available if you're using the [The Curator's Companion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38529)﻿ mod by [Ic0nic0de](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/45243387)﻿.
Optional patch now available if you're using the [Volkihar Knight - Vampire Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4806)﻿ mod and the patch by [SpaceDroner](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38546)﻿.
  

  
  
\*(I didn't go back and double check that the recipes to make the replicas corresponded with the keyword, so if you notice a discrepancy please let me know!)
