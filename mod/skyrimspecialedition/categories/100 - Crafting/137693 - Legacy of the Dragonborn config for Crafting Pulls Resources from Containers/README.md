Crafting Pulls Resources from Containers is a phenomenal way to marry the convenience of both Craftloot and The Curator's Companion without nasty script issues. They have been tested together and work great! However they do require a bit of mucking with the ini and finding the correct references to get up and running.
  
  
This ini file contains the following containers (if I've missed any, please drop a comment!):
  
  

  
* Archaeology Fragments
Building Materials
  
* Clutter
Cooked Food
  
* Firewood
Fossil Storage
  
* Gems
Heartstones
  
* Ingots
Ingredients
  
* Leathercraft
Poisons
  
* Potions
Raw Food
  
* Scrolls
Soul Gems
  
* Spider Pods
Treasury
  
  
Installation
  
  
Install with your favorite mod manager (MO2) and make sure it overrides Crafting Pulls Resources from Containers.
  
~~Double check the index of the Legacy ESM in your load order. This file assumes that Legacy is loading at position 0E. If that's not the case for your load order, you'll need to change the first two characters of each entry on the "PermaLinks" line to the correct index, or this will not function properly.
  
  
If you're not sure how to find the index in your mod manager, you can always go into the console in game and type "help auryen" and take a look at the first two characters of his ID, these will be the correct starting characters for the ID's in the ini.~~
  
  
**As of v1.0.9 of Crafting Pulls Resources from Containers, the above editing is no longer necessary. The file should just work as downloaded.**

Limitations
  
Crafting Pulls Resources from Containers will not activate any recipes that require an ingredient to be in your inventory. The easiest example of this is the vanilla recipes for Leather. This is something the main mod would have to address if possible, but is worth noting here.
