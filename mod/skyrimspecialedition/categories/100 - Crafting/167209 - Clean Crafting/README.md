All crafting recipes at Forges and Tanning Racks will be hidden unless you have at least one of the required ingredients for that specific item in your inventory. This means you will not see recipes for items like Dwarven gear unless your inventory contains at least one Dwarven Ingot (or any other of the necessary ingredients). In specific, if a Dwarven Armor is crafted from Dwarven Ingots, Steel Ingots, Iron Ingots, and Leather Strips, you would see the crafting recipe only if you have at least one Dwarven Ingot, or at least one Steel Ingot, or at least one Iron Ingot, or at least one Leather Strip in your inventory.
  
  
Using either [SKSE Menu Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120352) or the included ini file you can specify a keybind to toggle the. Additionally the mod functionality can be extended to recipes for the skyforge, smelter, sharpening wheel, armor table, and cooking pot. 
  
  
The plugin is expected to be compatible with any mod-added crafting recipes.
  
  
The plugin patches crafting recipes at start-up; it does nothing else. Other than the intended changes it should have no impact on your game.
  
The plugin should be safe to uninstall at any time; recipes should automatically revert to their default vanilla behavior upon removal.
  
  
Compatible with 1.5.97, 1.6.1170, and likely most other versions.
