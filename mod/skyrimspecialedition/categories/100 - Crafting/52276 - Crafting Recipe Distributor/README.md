**CRAFTING RECIPE DISTRIBUTOR**

**Requirements**
  
SKSE64
  
Skyrim SE 1.5.39 +
  
meh's Address Library for SKSE Plugins
  
  
**Description**
  
SKSE plugin and framework that automatically creates smelting and tempering recipes for weapons/armor/clutter. Every single mod is supported\*. No need to run xEdit or similar patchers again whenever you adjust your load order.
  
  
\*Recipes are generated using weap/armor material keywords, or by checking their name/model path (ie. clutter/GoldBar.nif). New recipes can be added for items not detected by this process, or if you want to override default behavior (make iron weapons always give out 100 iron ingots).
  
  
***Smelting***
  

  
* [size=3]Playable armor/weapons/clutter can be smelted into ingots, or other materials, at the smelter. Light armor can be broken down into leather strips at the tanning rack.
  
Amount of materials received is calculated by checking for the appropriate crafting recipe. If that doesn't exist, amount is dynamically derived using weight ratio or cost ratio of item and material. For instance, expensive weapons that have the WeaponMaterialIron keyword will give out more iron ingots than base iron weapons. 
  
- Recipes (generated and vanilla) are hidden unless the player has enough materials. You won't be able to smelt equipped armor/weapons unless you have multiples of those in your inventory.
Maximum amount of materials received (when amount is dynamically derived) can be customized in po3\_CraftingRecipeDistributor.ini.
  
  
***Tempering***
  

  
* Tempering recipes are generated for armor and weapons that don't have existing tempering recipes (based on material keywords).

**Adding New Recipes/Blacklisting items**
  
  
Recipes/blacklist should be written to an ini file containing the suffix "\_CRD", in the Data folder (for example, MyMod\_CRD.ini).
  
  
***Recipes***
  

```
[SMELT/TEMPER]
