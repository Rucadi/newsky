Fishing CC brought us a lot of new fish food items, but there aren't a ton of foods you can make with them. If I'm going to spend time catching fish, I should be able to make soup with it. This mod mostly focuses on the food fish rather than the ingredient fish since those can be used to make potions.
  
  
Featuring:
  

  
* 119 new recipes you can make such as bisques, stews, dumplings, and cakes (like crab cakes but with different fish).
Survival hunger values for all foods
  
* Conditional recipes so that you must have the fish in your inventory for the recipe to appear. (Character in screenshots has all the fish.)
Some fishy foods with quirky effects for roleplay/fun.
  

  
The recipes all involve fish and then usually a couple other vanilla ingredients typically found in similar recipes (garlic, elves ear, carrots, potatoes, etc.) The dumplings, pies, and cakes will need typical baked good ingredients like flour. Some of the foods require more than one kind of fish. A list of all the available new recipes:
