This is an updated .dll file for [Console Commands Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28210) for Skyrim SE 1.6.629+ (Anniversary Edition).
  
It has all of the same features, except for the updated Help command, which I have a standalone improved version of [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74376).
  
A 1.5.97.0 .dll is also available in the fomod for people who would like to use HelpExtender's improved Help command on 1.5.97.0.
