This simple mod replaces the intro video with a blank file. 
  
It might create some flickering when starting the game.
  
   
Install with a mod manager or replace the file manually in *\**Skyrim Special Edition\Data\Video*   
When replacing be sure to make a backup of the *BGS\_Logo.bik* file.
  
   
To remove, just uninstall with your mod manager or replace the modded file with your backed up bik file.
  
   
   
**INI edit**As gentl3typhoon pointed out in the comments, the INI tweak to disable the intro movie also works in the SE.
  
Backup and open the *Skyrim.ini* file in *C:\Users\\*username\*\Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition\*Under the [General] part add: "*sIntroSequence=*" (without quotes) and save the file.
  
If *sIntroSequence=BGS\_Logo.bik* already exists, just remove the "*BGS\_Logo.bik*" and save
