So I know there are other mods that do this - Proteus does this. But I wanted a standalone mod that did it and did it quickly. And allowed me to save my favorite weathers as well.
  
  
**HSF Weather Control** is a lightweight, intuitive system that lets players explore and apply Skyrim's weather types directly from an in-game menu. Whether you're staging a scene, testing visual setups, or simply prefer a specific atmospheric mood, this mod gives you reliable control without console commands.
  
  
? **Core Features**
  

  
* **Category-Based Selection:** Browse weather types across categories — Clear, Cloudy, Rainy, Snowy, and Special.
**Real-Time Preview System:** Apply weather instantly and evaluate it in-game before locking it in.
  
* **Favorites Integration:** Save your most-used weathers for quick access.
**Override Options:** Choose temporary or persistent changes. Setting the weather to Temporary will allow the weather to change when you enter a new region. Setting it to permanent will override the weather until you either remove the override or choose a new weather.
  
* **Revert Functionality:** Return to the previously active weather.
**Spell:** The weathers are controlled through a Lesser Power - automatically added to the player.
