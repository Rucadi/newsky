# Unequip Quiver NG
- Author: imnotfamous
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

This is a brand new Unequip Quiver mod for the latest version of Skyrim.
  
It will unequip the quiver when switching to a non-ranged weapon, nothing more, nothing less.
  
  
Only for main character currently (not for followers and others NPCs). 
  
Vanilla behaviour (no memory of last quiver).
  
  
  
  
  
  
**Installation**
  

  
* Install it with your mod manager.
It should be safe to install/uninstall mid-game. There's no scripts and no data saved in your save files.
  
* It should work with any version of Skyrim (SE, AE) since CommonLibSSE NG supports both and is built with SE and AE flags enabled. VR is not supported unless requested. Tested on AE 1.6.1170.

  
  
**Requirement**
  

  
* [SKSE](https://skse.silverlock.org/)

**Incompatibilities**
  
There are reports of issues with mods that do almost the same thing, so don’t use them with this mod. Also, beware when uninstalling those mods; be sure it is safe:

The code is simple, but should be robust and easy to maintain: [Source code](https://github.com/obewan/UnequipQuiverNG)﻿.
