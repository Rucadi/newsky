This is a modder's utility, this does nothing on it's own without a supporting mod. This SKSE plugin enables a mod author to overwrite the XEMI (Emittence or region-based light) records found on a static object or a movable static utilizing a file formatted in json. Just needs to be enabled somewhere in your load order. JSON files will load in alphabetical order, lookups will be done in reverse alphabetical order of the loaded jsons.
