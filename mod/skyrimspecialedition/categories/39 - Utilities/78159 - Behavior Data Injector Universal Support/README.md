OVERVIEW
  
[/size][/b]
  
**The latest Behavior Data Injector SKSE plugin with added AE and VR support with a PDB for debugging.**
  
This offers no benefit to SSE users over the original.
  
Report any issues with this version of the SKSE plugin on this mod page. Do not harass the original author about supporting AE.
  
This version of the SKSE plugin may diverge from the original in the future, in order to keep compatibility if Skyrim is updated again.
  
  
This is mainly useful for providing optional data that animation and ESP mods (conditions, papyrus) can use. For example, a "warmth" value could be stored on an actor and used by DAR animations. As well as being a simple way to add serialiseable primitive values to actors. For example a "poise" mod could add a "poise health" variable to any actor in the game without tons of behaviour patches.
