*As you might know, Skyrim has radiant quests. Radiant quests search for a fitting location to send you, based on many aspects. When you conquered a Skyrim Realistic Conquering location, you don't want to be send to these locations afterwards. The SRC\_ERS plugin makes sure that doesn't happen. Due to the earlier mentioned many aspects, many mods change the same radiant quests. This plugin will help you solve these conflicts as best as possible, by forward the changes to a single plugin.*
  
  
*Creating a plugin specific to each and every load order takes too much time for me to do, so it might not solve every mod conflict you have. If you know how to solve mod conflicts using xEdit; make sure you check if any conflicts are still present and solve them manually.***Alternatively, you can also use the ERS Synthesis Patcher: [click here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/129334)**

**Installation**
  
All versions created by me now come with a handy fomod that will search for the one that best fits your load order.
  
Unfortunately this does not include every possibility in the universe, so you might have to resolve some conflicts yourself (or not).
  
If you want to manually install from scratch, all files are included in the .zip file.
  
  
Make sure this mod overwrites the files of the SRC locations you installed (in MO2 load it after SRC mods in the left panel). 
  
  
**Further manual conflict resolving (requires xEdit)**
  
After the fomod has chosen the optimal plugin for your load order, you might want to resolve any lingering mod conflicts. This is not required, but suggested (as is with all mod conflicts).
  
  

  
1. Load the SRC\_ERS.esp last in your loadorder
Open xEdit and load every plugin you have.
  
2. Go to the SRC\_ERS.esp and open the Quest dropdown.
Resolve any conflict by dragging entries into the SRC\_ERS.esp
  
3. If xEdit asks a plugin to become the master of the SRC\_ERS.esp accept.
Once you're done, save SRC\_ERS.esp and give it a nice spot in your load order.
