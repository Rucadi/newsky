This mod began as an attempt to create an **AddItemMenu** alternative for the Anniversary Update, but is growing to become a suite of UI tools, tweaks, and fixes. It is still in development an things are subject to change during the beta period. Everything in this was made by me for my own use, and as such I treat any suggestions or feature requests with caution.

Don't like the Creation Club banner nagging you? Want to remove buttons from the list? All can be yours for the low price of free!

What does QUI mean?
  

  
* Nothing, or perhaps Qudix's User Interface, you decide.

  
How do I configure settings?
  

  
* The default settings file is in `Data/SKSE/Plugins/QUI.toml` and can be opened with any text editor.
You can also create a `QUI\_Custom.toml` file in the same location to save settings across updates.
  

  
Why do I get a "did not have a view due to missing dependencies" error?
  

  
* You didn't install SkyUI correctly (or at all)

  
Can you add a search function?
  

  
* I've been asked this question since day one, and the answer is still the same. *Maybe*.

  
Can you add (x) feature?
  

  
* Maybe, if the stars align and I have the knowledge and free time.

  
Is it compatible with (x) mod?
  

  
* This mod does not replace any files, vanilla or modded. It should work with everything. I think.

  
Sauce?
