The Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE) is a tool used by many Skyrim mods that expands scripting capabilities and adds additional functionality to the game.
  
  
Once installed, no additional steps are needed to launch Skyrim with SKSE's added functionality. You can start the game using SKSE from skse64\_loader.exe.
  
  
**Compatibility: SKSE64 supports the releases of Skyrim on Steam and GOG. Other stores (EGS, Windows Store, Game Pass) are not supported.**
  
  
Installation (Manual)
  

  
* Download the SKSE Build for your game version from the Files tab.
Extract all files inside the top-level folder in the ZIP to your game folder (where Skyrim.exe is located).
  
* Run the game using skse64\_loader.exe.
To confirm it is working, open the console with the tilde (`) key and type *getskseversion*. This will display the version number of the current SKSE build.
