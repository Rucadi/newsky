![](https://i.imgur.com/tgYaECE.png)﻿Container Distribution Framework is an SKSE plugin that allows mod authors to dynamically add items to container references without the need to replace the entire container. In addition, thanks to a robust rule system, it can also dynamically distribute to non-specific containers based on location, type of container, while leaving merchant containers untouched.

**Requirements and runtimes:**
  
1. Skyrim SE version 1.6.1130+
  
2. [Skyrim Script Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30379)﻿
  
3. [Address Library for SKSE Plugins](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444)﻿
  
  
**A note on the Address Library:** 
  
This mod needs the 
  
  
*All in one Address Library (Anniversary Edition) version,* regardless of whether or not you have purchased the AE DLC.
  
  
**A note on runtime:** 
  
As stated above, this requires Skyrim SE version 1.6.1130+, sometimes called Skyrim AE. Please do not ask me to support older versions, I don't want to have multiple Skyrim installations.
