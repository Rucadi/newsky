**Description**
  
  
**Disclaimer:** **This mod is no longer supported. While I like the idea, the execution is bad. Too many people were having issues, which I was unable to fix or provide support for. I'm tired of telling people I don't know what's wrong with their setup[b] and being unable to help them.**
  
  
 [/b]**I am keeping this mod up for reference's sake. If you have issues, I will be unable to assist. Please do not message me about this. If you use this mod, you do so at your own risk. Thank you for your understanding.**
  
  
As I do a lot of testing for my mods, I often needed to add perk points. As such, I have made this small utility tweak to easily add perk points through console commands.
  
  
When having this tweak installed, you can use the following console commands:
  
  

```
set PerkPointsToAdd to <amount>
  

  
set PerkPointsToRemove to <amount>
```

  
  
So, for instance, if you want to add 7 perk points, you can use the command:
  
  

```
set PerkPointsToAdd to 7
```

  
  
And if you want to remove 3 perk points, you can use:
  
  

```
set PerkPointsToRemove to 3
```

  
  
This mod is an ESLified ESP, which mean it won't take up a space in your load order.
  
  
Warning: Adding more than 255 perk points at once might crash the game, so be careful with that. This is unfortunately a limit of the engine, which I can do little about.
  
  
**FAQ**
  
  
Q: If I type the console command, it says it's an unknown variable. What can I do?
  
A: A lot of people have reported this, but I cannot replicate this in my game. I have no idea why this would occur. I would assume it's a conflict, but even then I don't know. You're on your own in this case. If you do find a solution, let me know.
  
  
Q: After typing the console command, I don't get perk points. How I can fix this?
  
A: A lot of people have reported this, but I cannot replicate this in my game. I have no idea why this would occur. I would assume it's a conflict, but even then I don't know. You're on your own in this case. If you do find a solution, let me know.
  
  
Q: This mod doesn't work.
  
A: This comment doesn't work.
  
  
Q: ESPFE?
  
A: Yes.
  
  
Q: Does installing/updating/uninstalling on an existing save work?
  
A: As far as I know, it should. However, it's good practice to keep a backup save prior to doing this, just in case.
  
  
Q: Is this compatible with <insert mod>?
  
A: I don't know by heart. You might need to check yourself.
  
  
Q: Will you make a patch for <insert mod>?
  
A: Only if it's a mod I use myself or plan on using, I have enough time and I actually like the idea. Otherwise, feel free to do it yourself. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: I have a suggestion to improve the mod. Can you do it?
  
A: Maybe, if I have time and I like the idea, I'll consider it.
  
  
Q: Will you port this to <insert platform>?
  
A: No, I myself only support the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If someone else wants to port it, feel free. (see permission) If you decide to port it, you yourself take full responsibility to offer support to said port. I will not provide no support for any ports by third parties.
  
  
Q: I use a ported version of this mod on <insert platform> and I have a problem. Can you help?
  
A: I don't provide any support for third party ports on other platforms than the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If you have issues, you should adress the person that ported it.
  
  
Q: Does this work on Skyrim 1.6+, aka "Anniversary Edition"?
  
A: Yes, it should.
  
  
Q: Why don't your mods use MCMs and instead use this janky console command system to set globals?
  
A: I am not a fan of MCMs. You can set the globals by making a patch in xEdit. I have no plans of changing this. If you want to add an MCM, feel free. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: Why don't you use FOMODs?
  
A: That would require reuploading the entire mod, in question, even if I only make a small change. My internet is limited and reuploading the files each time will take a huge chunk of my monthly volume.
