**-Dynamic Activation Key-**

  
Pressing SHIFT (or whatever key you configure) enables an alternate behavior in mods that support it. DAK can let other mods know when the shift key is being pressed, basically.
  
  
The mechanic is inspired by "**[Read or Take](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69588)**" by legendary PO3:
  

  
* *"Activate" a book*= Default vanilla activation (read)
*"SHIFT + Activate" a book* = Take the book without reading
  

  
I really like this approach as it's intuitive and it allows you to declutter the ability menu. Less time in menus = more focus on the gameplay.
  
  
***How to use:***Step 1: Install this mod if it's required by another mod. 
  
Step 2: ???
  
Step 3: Enjoy!

**-CHANGING SHIFT INTO ANOTHER HOTKEY -**Spoiler
  
  
PAPYRUS EDITION:
  
  
**Step 1:** Check the list of [DXScanCodes](https://ck.uesp.net/wiki/Input_Script#DXScanCodes)﻿. You want the second and third column. Let's say for example you want to change the hotkey to the letter "G", we check the column in the middle and we see it's the number 34.
  
  
**Step 2:** Open the console and type "Set DAK\_Hotkey to 34" (34 because of the example, you should choose whatever number you want).
  
  
**Step 3:** Save the game. Load the save. A message will let you know that the hotkey has changed. Enjoy!
  
  
Does it support controllers/mouse? Yes, everything in the list of DXS codes.
  
  
DLL EDITION:
  
**Step 1:** Change the ini inside the mod.
  
  
  
  
  
**-HOW IT WORKS / HOW TO ADD SUPPORT FOR YOUR MOD -**
  
Spoiler
  
  
While SHIFT is pressed, my mod changes a global (DynamicActivationKey) into a 1. Lifting the key turns the global into a 0. This, together with Papyrus Extender allows us to update the activation prompt and the crosshair dynamically by pressing the shift key.
  
  
You can then use an activation perk + text replacer perk to create a custom action, which can then trigger your script, ability or spell when the global reference is at 1. If you need guidance, I recommend checking one of the easy examples (Like the "Take a Peek" patch), but you can also reach out to me and I can guide you step by step :)
  
  
  
  
**-MOD IDEAS-**Spoiler
  
  
Some quick ideas if you want to make a new mod supporting DAK. All relatively easy to implement.
  
  
**Follower:**"Activate" Follower = Talk (Default vanilla)
  
"Shift + Activate" = Open Inventory
  
  
**Bed:**"Activate" Bed = Use (default)
  
"Shift + Activate" = Sit down / Lie Down
  
  
**Chairs:**"Activate" Chairs = Use (default)
  
"Shift + Activate" = Salvage for firewood (in abandoned places)
  
  
**Enemies while sneaking:**"Activate" enemy while out of sight and sneaking  = pickpocket (vanilla)
  
"Shift + Activate on the above = Knock out
  
  
**Traps:**"Activate" Trap = Use (default)
  
"Activate + Shift Trap = Pick up trap
  
  
**Door to your home or inn room doors:**"Activate" = Open (default)
  
"Activate + Shift" = Lock Door

**ESL flagged?**ESL flagged.
  
  
**Is this really necessary?**You can replicate the same thing in each individual mod easily, but then I'd have 4 or 5 identical functions running, when I can have just one. Making this mod a master also means I can ensure compatibility between all my mods using the SHIFT key for their interactions (and if anyone wants to, they can also use the global variable for their custom SHIFT interactions)
  
  
**Is this a DLL?**No,  but the function is so simple (If player presses a key = change global) that it won't really matter.
  
  
**The mod is not working!!111**Make sure you've got powerofthree's Papyrus Extender installed. Make sure that the mod you intend to use this on is also updated. Immersive Interactions, Take a Peek, Vampire Feeding Tweaks all got updated just now.
  
  
**JaySerpa and hotkeys? What's going on???**Well, it's not really a hotkey. This mod is a way to *remove* hotkeys and powers. I think it's great, I can never remember hotkeys or powers and I forget to use them. But yeah! I've got a lot going on actually! Expect several mods and surprises from me soon.
