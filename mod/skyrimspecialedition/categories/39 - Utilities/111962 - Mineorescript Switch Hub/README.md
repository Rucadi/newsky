Launching this mod will install the MCM version if SkyUI is enabled, or the Creations version if it is disabled.In the first step, the corresponding mod is checked for enable/disable and the best Mineorescript is automatically selected.
  
  
Some mods, such as Go to Bed, can be enabled or disabled in the MCM. See Supported Mods for more information.![](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/111962/111962-1713803910-1591498516.jpeg)
  
**In the case of Ore falls on the ground when mined, the original mod spawns the ore in a slightly higher location, but my mod spawns it on the ground.**

**【How to Install】**
  
  
New game is recommended. If introduced in the middle of the game, the previously introduced Mineorescript will be enabled and will not work properly.
  
For Creations, SKSE is not available in the environment; if SKYUI is not installed, a mod selection message will appear only the first time.
