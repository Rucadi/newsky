FAQ:
  
  
Q: I have the following errors with one of my plugins what do I do?

A: Occurs with plugins made with the ReProccer, NPC Editor or other 3rd party tools. These
  
cannot be corrected with xEdit. You can try using the official Bethesda
  
Editor but the official tool may not be able to correct the errors with
  
loss of data.
  
  
Q: The Font is too small, I have a 4K or Hi-Res monitor. I can't read the text how do I increase the size?
  
  
A: There is some support for font scaling for Large Size, Hi-Res, or 4K
  
monitors. This will help readability but in some situations there is no
  
control for popup boxes that expect input from the user.
