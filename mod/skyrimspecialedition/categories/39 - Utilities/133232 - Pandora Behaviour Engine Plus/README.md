A modular and lightweight behavior engine for TES Skyrim SE, for creatures and humanoids. Built with backwards compatibility in mind for [Nemesis Unlimited Behavior Engine](https://github.com/ShikyoKira/Project-New-Reign---Nemesis-Main) and FNIS, Pandora Behaviour Engine+ is an alternative engine streamlines both the author and user experience through a simplified UI, robust logging, intuitive formats, and fast patching times.
  
  
Pandora runs on Windows, Linux\*, and MacOS\*\*
  
\* Use Wine or Proton
  
\*\* MacOS support is untested

 **Core:**
  

  
* Faster patching times (will depend on end user hardware specs).
Simpler usage.
  
* Various startup arguments to customize output paths and operation.
Verbose and precise logging via the output "Engine.log"
  
* Modular back-end design; capable of supporting multiple animation/behavior patching configurations.
Long-term support.
  
* Full creature support.
Support for code-based custom behavior plugins.
  
* Support for both FNIS and Nemesis mod formats.
Strong error tolerance; illegal edits by mods are isolated and reverted to vanilla, without tripping up the rest of the patching process.
  
* Descriptive, clear and copy-able program messages.
Finds Skyrim SE/AE automatically via Windows Registry; works out of the box in proper mod list environments.
  

  
 ﻿**Quality of Life:**

  
* Search box for behaviour patches.
Light/dark theme.
  
* Select and unselect all checkboxes.
Grippers for drag and drop priority. 
  
* Task bar flasher to indicate patching complete.
QoL command lines (e.g "--auto\_close" to close Pandora after patching)
  
* Keyboard based sorting ('-' and '+')
Automatic output tracking and old output deletion.
  
* Button to view output folder.
