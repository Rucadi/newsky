Here's a [video tutorial by Gopher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wkwtgp3x25s) on how to install body mods and BodySlide with the Nexus Mod Manager.
  
Made for Fallout 4, but works for Skyrim as well.
  
  
Manual
  

  
1. Download and open the archive with 7Zip, and extract the 'CalienteTools' folder to Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim Special Edition/Data.
After you're done, the executable "BodySlide x64.exe" for you to launch can be found in: "Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim Special Edition/Data/CalienteTools/BodySlide"
  

  
Vortex
  

  
1. Download and install the archive to Vortex like you would do with any other mod and enable it.
Make sure your Vortex deploys correctly by clicking the "Deploy Mods" toolbar button in the "Mods" section.
  
2. In the dashboard go to "Add Tool".
In the "Target" field, choose the "BodySlide x64.exe" file from your game installation's real data folder, NOT the Vortex mods folder: "Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim Special Edition/Data/CalienteTools/BodySlide".
  
3. Install any BodySlide addons such as body mods and outfits to Vortex as well.

Mod Organizer
  

  
1. Download and install the archive to MO like you would do with any other mod and enable it.
In MO2, go to the Data tab on the right, locate the BodySlide x64.exe in the CalienteTools/BodySlide folder, right click it, and add it as an executable. You can then launch it through MO2.
  
2. When BodySlide is open, click on the Settings button and ensure the Game Data Path points to your actual game data folder, e.g. "C:/Games/Steam/SteamApps/Common/Skyrim Special Edition/Data/".
Install any BodySlide addons such as body mods and outfits to MO as well.
  
3. After BatchBuilding, the files will appear in your Overwrites folder. [You will need to create a new mod folder, for example 'BodySlide Output', move the files from Overwrites into this folder, and then enable it.](https://www.afkmods.com/index.php?/topic/8960-slessefo4-bodyslide-and-mo2-what-to-do-with-bodyslide-output-files/)﻿
We do not troubleshoot MO installation issues, please ask for help in Mod Organizer communities.
  

  
Troubleshooting
  

  
* Make sure you've installed the body mod for the matching game (download CBBE SE for Skyrim SE/AE, not CBBE LE).
If using mod managers such as Vortex and MO, first confirm that other mods are generally working in-game.
  
* If using mod managers such as Vortex and MO, set up your BodySlide shortcut to point to the real game folder (Steam folder) instead of the Vortex/MO specific mods folders.

  
Updating
  
You can uninstall old/install new, or just install the new files and overwrite if prompted. Just be sure to back up your personal presets/groups/bodies/outfits in the SliderSets/SliderPresets/ShapeData/SliderGroups folders so they don't get deleted, whether by accident or buggy mod manager.

Q: If I have an issue, what would you suggest I do before anything (including posting questions)?
  
A: Read the mod description, especially the FAQ. Read the stickies. Launch SSE with the Steam launcher if you usually only use SKSE64.  Reinstall BodySlide. Install BodySlide manually if your mod manager of choice fails to do its main purpose.
  
  
Q1: Does this work with [insert body type here] or is it just CBBE?
  
A: It works with any body or outfit. However, conversion between body types require conversion slider sets (see below).
  
  
Q2: I created a nude body, but when I batch-built the outfits, everyone suddenly has underwear! How do I fix it?
  
A: When you batch-build, only select what you actually want. If you don't want an underwear body to overwrite your nude one, don't have it selected. You can use the group filter of BodySlide by clicking on the magnifying glass at the top.
  
  
Q3: BodySlide fails to create the bodies I make. How can I get the meshes installed?
  
A: Make your changes to the sliders, and then CTRL+Click the 'Build' button. The femalebody\_0.nif and femalebody\_1.nif will then appear in the BodySlide folder. You will need to copy these to your Skyrim/Data/meshes/actors/character/character assets/ directory, and allow any overwrites. You also may need to copy these elsewhere if you use a standalone race/follower mod, so consult that mod's description/readme. Note that if you use MO2, BodySlide will generally place the built meshes into your overwrites folder. You need to turn that into its own mod in MO2 each time you do a Build/BatchBuild.
  
  
Q4: Is there a Conversion Set for [Body A] to [Body B]?
  
A: Since each body is different, each pair of body types requires its own conversion slider. Several conversion sets have been made already, but since we have limited time, not all possible body types have been addressed. Creating a conversion set is fairly easy, and in many cases doesn't require mesh editing. Look for tutorials on this topic for more information.
  
  
Q5: Why is CBBE used in all the bundled conversion sets?
  
A: There are a few reasons for this. Primarily, the flexibility of the CBBE body with the large number of customization sliders makes it possible to match most body shapes without mesh editing. Small adjustments can be made swiftly within Outfit Studio.
  
  
Additionally, we use CBBE as a bridge. Creating a "Body->CBBE" conversion automatically allows us to then use a "CBBE->Other Body" slider that has already been created, saving lots of time. Due to these reasons, we recommend that others creating their own conversion sets also use CBBE as a bridge, but there is no technical reason why any body mesh can't be used in the conversion set.
  
  
Q6: NifSkope does not show my exported meshes! How to fix?
  
A: Sometimes, Outfit Studio does not apply any weights to some vertices because they are too far off from the reference shape. It should tell you about it in a warning when attempting to save a project or export a mesh.
  
  
To fix, use the "Mask Weighted Vertices" feature and the weight brush to paint weights on the unmasked parts. After that, NifSkope shows the .nif again and the unweighted vertices show up in-game.
  
  
Q7: I set the wrong build path in Outfit Studio when saving a slider set. How do I change it now?
  
A: Open up the "SliderSets/\*.xml" file you saved with your conversion in a text editor and adjust the output path to be the correct one, then save.
  
  
Q8: The meshes in my preview windows have a black/grey mask all over them saying "no image". How do I make the right textures appear?
  
A: Make sure you have installed a compatible body mod, and have set up BodySlide according to the installation instructions. You may need to launch the game without SKSE64 at least once to ensure the registry is set. If using Vortex or MO2, ensure that the Game Data Path under BodySlide's Settings points to your \...\Skyrim Special Edition\Data\ folder.
  
  
Q9: Why do I get an error saying "Failed to find game install" or "Failed to load Setup.xrc file."?
  
A: Registry isn't set, or BodySlide wasn't installed properly. Launch Skyrim using the Steam launcher instead of SKSE to fix the registry, and try launching BodySlide again. If it still doesn't work, make sure all the files are installed correctly and you're running it as admin. If setting the directory manually, through the 'Settings' button, ensure it's pointing to Skyrim Special Edition/Data. Try downloading and installing the mod with all anti-virus software disabled. If you're using NMM, make sure you're using the latest files from GitHub.
  
Note that Vortex/MO aren't perfect and may not install all of the files, especially Setup.xrc. If so, you may have to install manually.
  
  
Q10: Why does the FBX import create weird texture coordinates?
  
A: You have to split all edges of your mesh along the UV seams. The NIF format only supports one texture coordinate per vertex, so UV seams need duplicated vertices.
  
  
Q11: Why do I get an error saying "OpenGL context is not OK" for Outfit Studio or the preview window?
  
A: This means the driver of the graphics chip used doesn't support the version of OpenGL that's required. Make sure to update all of your graphics drivers (manually). In case there are multiple graphics chips built into your PC, set BodySlide to run with the dedicated one only.
  
  
Q12: I didn't save my preset. Can I get the slider configuration using the created meshes?
  
A: No. If you don't save a preset, then it's gone. Your only option is to try and recreate it.
  
  
Q13: I use Vortex/MO, and even though I've installed a body mod, BodySlide is blank/Outfit Studio throws up an error. How do I fix this?
  
A: You need to make sure the body you have installed is actually BodySlide-compatible. After that, ensure you have followed the installation instructions exactly, especially about making sure the Game Data Path is set correctly, and that if you use Vortex or MO2, that you are launching BodySlide through those mod managers.
  
  
Q14:There's ~~scary red~~ shiny gold text at the bottom of BodySlide. Wat do?
  
A:This was added in BodySlide v.5.5.0. The ~~red~~ gold colour means you have more than one option in BodySlide for the same thing. If you right-click it, you will see these options. If you click on one, BodySlide will swap to it in the Outfit/Body drop-down menu. If you check the box next to the ~~red~~ gold text, it will turn blue. This means BodySlide will only build this mesh when you BatchBuild, reducing the number of options you have to select when BatchBuilding.

Uninstalling BodySlide is as simple as deleting the BodySlide folder you originally extracted, or removing it using your mod manager. Make sure you backup any presets or edited files you've made with Outfit Studio. Mod managers *should* leave such files alone.
  
  
Removing outfit files created with BodySlide involves deleting the appropriate meshes within the "Data/meshes" directory - but only you know which ones those might be.
