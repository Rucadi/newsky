Mfg Fix NG
  
Extended implementation of Mfg Fix with new functions and animated expression transitions.
  
[size=3]
  
[/size]Installation[size=3]
  
Install like any other mod, preferably with a mod manager. Overwrite the original.
  
  
[size=3][size=4]For Users
  
[/size]By default, animated expression transitions are disabled for the original MfgFix's functions to preserve backwards compatibility. If you'd like to smooth every expression, increase fDefaultSpeed to a value between 0 and 1 in mfgfix.ini.
  
Mods that use the new expression functions will be smoothened. Check out [Conditional Expressions Extended](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/91438) if you're interested in seeing how these transitions look.
  
  
For Developers
  
NG adds several new functions intended to allow for smooth, animated expression transitions. If you've used the original mod's API, these should be familiar. Comments are included in MfgConsoleFuncExt.psc.[/size]
  
  
Future Plans[/size]
  

  
* Native expression replacement system (OAR for expressions)
