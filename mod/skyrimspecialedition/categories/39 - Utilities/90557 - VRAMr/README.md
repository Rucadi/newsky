**[b]VRAMr is an automated utility to optimise your texture files for your
  
Wabbajack, Nexus Collection or personal and unique load order
  
  
BC7 texture format is decoded much faster by your GPU in-game than any other format
  
  
VRAMr also downscales your textures resolution so your game consumes less VRAM
  
  
When thousands of textures are optimised using these methods, the total gains are
  
very noticeable with smoother performance and less stutters
  
  
  
For information and setup instructions see the videos below and refer to the interactive User Guide
  
  
  
  
In the below video the VRAMr section starts around 8 mins 45, although I highly recommend watching the whole video to optimise your Skyrim using the variety of tools available to deliver best performance**
  
The below video is a longer and more detailed use of VRAMr
  
  
Once you have VRAMr installed and have it running you will also find an interactive User Guide to refer to with lots of helpful information

***VRAMr makes copies of your textures files and then dependent on each files resolution and other criteria downscales them***

***This means your original mod files all stay untouched with the benefit that you can simply turn VRAMr on or off easily in your mod manager***

***Certain textures such as mountains, dragons and large actors like giants are not downscaled to preserve some fidelity***

***There are different quality presets to choose from to match your CPU/GPU/VRAM***
