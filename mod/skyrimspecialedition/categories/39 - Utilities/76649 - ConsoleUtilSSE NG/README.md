"I am aware the game has updated. I don't have a lot of time/energy to work on these things anymore, and I will my mods on my own time. Stop
  
contacting me."

Rather than posting yet another comment on the ConsoleUtilSSE modpage asking for an update to the new Skyrim version I just did it myself.
  
  
Source code is available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/VersuchDrei/ConsoleUtilSSE).
  
  
  
~~I will most likely not add any more updates to this other than maybe bugfixes or support for new Skyrim versions if there are more to come.~~ I guess this didn't age well as there is probably more to come. :^(
