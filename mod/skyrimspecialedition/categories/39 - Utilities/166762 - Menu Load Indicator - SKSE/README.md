Not a ton to say about this one, I use headphones and I have long start up times with the various modlists that I use. This mod will play a short noise when your start up menu is fully loaded and can be interacted with, so you can do something else on your computer or go do the dishes without having to constantly check.
  
  
SKSE plugin, it simply looks for the event that says that the menu is loaded, and then plays a sound of your choosing. By default, it plays the NEW GAME START sound, but it can be replaced by your own sounds by either replacing ***"Data/SKSE/Plugins/LoadIndicator/MenuSound.wav"*** or by editing the ini file to a path of your choosing. Only supports *.WAV* files for now (just import and export from Audacity if you don't have it installed). This will play on top of your main menu music, if you have any.
  
  
  
  
***Installation:***
  
- Install with a mod manager of your choosing, no reason not to have one at this point.
  
  
- Manual: Drop into the Data folder. Suffer.
  
  
**Uninstallation:**
  
- Installation, but in reverse.
  
  
- Can be uninstalled at anytime, this does not do anything past the Main menu screen (obviously).
  
  
This simple plugin was made with the assistance of Cursor and Claude Opus 4.5, if that bothers you for some reason, don't use the mod.
