This mod does multiple things.
  

  
1. **It auto-generates console commands for you**.
     
   When you use the "help" command, you can click on the result to automatically inserts a relevant console command into the prompt. If you click on a WEAPON record for example, it adds "player.additem <that weapon> 1" or if you click on a CELL record it adds the "coc" command.
     
   If you click on the same line again, it will generate a different console command for that record, for example clicking continuously on a PERK record will generate "addperk", "removeperk" and "hasperk" commands.
     
   The mod also support "sqs" (Show Quest Stages) command, so you can advance quests easily.
**Adds a Cheatsheet that can be activated in console.**
  
Using a hotkey (default: F11, can be customized in MCM) you can bring up a cheatsheet that lists most useful console commands, categorized and with examples.
  
2. **Adds an API for creating new console commands.**
     
   Useful for folks wanting to add their own commands for easy access.
**Adds several new console commands that are mostly useful for debugging and testing stuff.**
  
These include commands to learn/unlock shouts, add ALL items of a particular type (weapon/armor/potion/etc) from a mod to your inventory, give yourself perk points, and enabling/disabling fast travel. You can refer to the cheatsheet to see how they can be used.

**Small notes, please read.**
  
This mod uses Papyrus so it does not work before you load a game. After you go into the game, it should work.
  
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
This mod does not touch the Console menu directly, so it should be compatible with everything, that includes mods that do modify the Console menu like More Informative Console.
  
Also it integrates with [Skyrim Search](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45689?tab=description) so you can teleport NPCs to yourself, advance quests or complete them using console commands.
