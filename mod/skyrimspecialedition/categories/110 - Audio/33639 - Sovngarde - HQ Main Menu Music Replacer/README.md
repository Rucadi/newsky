[/size]Have you ever wanted to hear the amazing Sovngarde music again after leaving Sovngarde? Now you can with this mod!
  
  
This mod replaces main menu theme music with the high quality (48kHz 192kbit  .XWM) Sovngarde chant from the [Unofficial High Definition Audio Project.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18115)
  
  
[Here's a link to the audio](https://youtu.be/c6q2t2GSJb8?si=hgrV8Sq3GIqBICBU) from the official soundtrack.
  
  
**Why use this version over other mods which make a similar change?**
  
I was unsatisfied with the audio quality of the other Sovngarde main theme replacers. This version has been amplified to match the volume of the original theme music, without unneeded clipping, distortion, or strange equalizers.
  
  
**Installation:**Install with a mod manager or extract the contents to your Skyrim Special Edition Data folder.
