Mephala is the Daedric Prince of lies, secrets, and hidden plots — yet her voice in Skyrim often lacks the menace and weight that her presence deserves. The original audio was simply Lydia speaking slower with a reverb effect, hardly immersive!
  
The new voice gives Mephala a unique, but familiar sound.
  
Whether you encounter her during the *Whispering Door* quest or simply wish to enhance your immersion, this revoice ensures that every word she speaks feels brushed with dark intent. Depending on the option you choose to install, you can drastically change how she sounds. Patches are provided for popular mods that add dialogue for Mephala. See the requirements tab for more.

Zero install requirements. This mod is simple loose audio files in .fuz format. Provided patches come in matching formats, some audio files will be in .wav or .xwm.
  
Download the main mod and use the FOMOD installation to select the voice you would like and its supporting patches.
  
I've also added the individual zip files if you want to download and install those separately.

ORDER THE AUDIO IS PLAYED**
  
First is Vanilla - *Plain ole' Lydia whispers.*
  
2nd is Option 1  - *Least edited version. For people who want minimal voice effects.*
  
3rd is Option 2  - *More effects to make the disembodied voice more omnipresent.*
  
4th is Option 3 - *Same as option 2, but with a creepy ethereal effect added.*
  
5th is Option 4 - *Similar to 3, but more evil sounding. Think of Mephala from ESO.*

**Some mod recommendations**
  
[A Path to Mephala](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/138035) - Removes the main quest requirement for the Whispering Door quest (still requires you to be level 20). Also provides a dark elf follower. ESL flagged. Compatible with all mods my mod provides patches for.
  
﻿[MW Scums Of Sacrifice](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/137928)﻿ - Gives you some followers that you won't feel bad sacrificing for Mephala or Boethia. ESL flagged.
  
[SavrenX Lux Weapons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32667)﻿ - Specifically the remake of the Ebony Blade, but all options are great.﻿ No ESP.
