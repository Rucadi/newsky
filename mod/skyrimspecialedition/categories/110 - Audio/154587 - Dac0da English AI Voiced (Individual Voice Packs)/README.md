I started playing through Dac0da and was loving it except for the mismatch between the original synth voices for the mod mismatching the text of the third party English Translation.  So I went ahead and regenerated the voice files.  I had to completely make up new voices for the uniquely voiced NPCs and they might not match the character as I'm only an hour into the mod and haven't met most people yet.  But the voices are higher quality though not 11labs.  These are AI voiced so if you do not like AI voices, do not use it.
  
  
~~Use with [DAc0da - AI Voiced - English Addon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/138438) as that mod contains the Sload voices and a few others that were already good.~~ And use with [DAC0DA - English Translation](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/135682)﻿ as the voices were generated with the text changes from that mod in mind.  Load mine afterwards.
  
  
  
Update: With the release of [DAc0da - ElevenLabs Voiced](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/154663?tab=files&file_id=646282&nmm=1)﻿, this mod is almost redundant as the other mod is more complete.  However, listening to both voices, I like how some of mine turned out so I'm uploading them as individual voice packs so you can use the other mod as a base and any of my voices on top of it if you prefer.  Some of my voices contain alternate voices that were also voiced with 11labs and I was asked to upload them.
