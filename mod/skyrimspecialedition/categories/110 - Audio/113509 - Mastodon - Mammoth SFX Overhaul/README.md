**You MAY NOT use my mods in paywalled modlists. Already I've seen some 'modlist authors' doing this and I strictly do not condone this. Modlists and load orders should not be hidden behind patreon subscriptions.
  
  
  
[Audio Overhaul for Skyrim SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12466) contains VOLUME SLIDERS for magic, weapons and other categories. If you do not like the volume, I highly suggest you install this as it is compatible with Immersive Sounds instead of leaving comments about your ears being hurt. It will spare both you and I a headache.**
  
  
  
Vanilla Mammoth sounds suck SO much. I opened them up in Audacity and they were crispy and low-quality, so I had my good pal [Kojillama](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/85620603) source me some elephant audio for your enjoyment.
  
  
Mastodon replaces existing Mammoth sounds with new cries and trumpets from the Mammoth's ﻿closest living relative; the Asian elephant. Here are some examples below!
