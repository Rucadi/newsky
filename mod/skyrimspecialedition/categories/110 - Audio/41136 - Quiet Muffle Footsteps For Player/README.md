In vanilla Skyrim, casting Muffle or using a similar "muffled" pair of boots using an enchantment will "silence" your footsteps for the purposes of NPC detection, but will not aurally silence the actual, physical sounds coming out of your feet. 
  
  
Thus when you are sneaking, running or jumping with a "muffle" effect on you can clearly hear the patter of your feet, which kind of kills immersion when you are literally right behind an NPC and he can't hear your clear-as-day "tap tap tap" on the surfaces three feet away from him. 
  
  
But with my mod, you are completely silent!  This silence effect works for all surfaces, even water!  The only exception (as far as I'm aware, so far) is when you jump directly into water.  Otherwise you can even sprint through puddles silently!
  
  
Now you will be as silent as a ninja with the Muffle effect so you can truly feel like a master of sneak!
  
  
Includes 2 additional .esp patch files for [Audio Overhaul of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12466) and [Immersive Sounds - Compendium](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/523).  Quiet Muffle.esp and both patches MUST ABSOLUTELY be loaded AFTER AoS and ISC plugins, or else you will once again begin to hear your footsteps at random intervals.
  
  
  
Final note - normally I never beg for endorsements, they are just numbers on a screen and aren't that important to me.  But this seemingly very simple plugin took a LONG LONG LONG time to make for such a small effect...  It involves adding conditions to each individual footstep sound combination, including for the two patches... all told I had to manually add 2 separate conditions to HUNDREDs of records, which was boring and excruciating work.  It took me about 6 hours all told of monotonous repetition of clicks and keypresses to cover everything. 
  
  
Please, if you appreciate this mod, come back and endorse it so that shiny little blue number near the top of the page can make me feel like I'm not wasting my life, LOLLLLLLL
  
  
Enjoy :)
