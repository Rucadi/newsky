All this mod does is pitch-shift the Malacath voice lines to make them sound more feminine. All NPCs will still refer to Malacath as "he" since I didn't change any of their lines. This is made primarily as an unofficial companion mod to PSBoss' female Malacath statue (listed as a soft requirement, and pictured in the screenshot for this mod).
  
  
No plugin file, nothing but sound files. Install and uninstall any time.
  
  
Comparison sample can be found on Soundcloud at the link below. Original voice is first, followed by this mod.

I tagged this as "not lore-friendly", but it could be argued it is. Daedric Princes don't have defined genders and some of them will even genderbend from time to time. Malacath, for example, once appeared in lore as a naked elf woman.
