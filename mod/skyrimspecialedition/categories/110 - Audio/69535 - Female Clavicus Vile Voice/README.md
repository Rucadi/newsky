I hired a fantastic voice actress (Elizabeth Plant) to revamp Clavicus Vile's lines so they better match PSBoss's New Shrine of Clavicus Vile SE mod.

Zero plugins, just simple loose audio files. Install/uninstall at any time. You *should* be able to use this in all versions of Skyrim without issue.
  
Tagged as not lore friendly.
  
Any references to Clavicus Vile were not changed. Some NPCs, audio files, and literature will still refer to the character as a male daedric prince.
