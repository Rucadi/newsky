[font=Tahoma]Revoices the new NPCs added by the fantastic The Courier Crew mod to sound more natural. Uses ElevenLabs AI voices. For the sake of avoiding potential issues regarding AI voices, I chose to make these voices fully synthetic from ElevenLabs and not copied/trained from any Bethesda files.
  
  
These are only sound files, no esp. The voices are fairly decent matches to the mod's original intent, and are, in my opinion, more natural sounding and believable. This mod does not touch the original courier's voice, as that is already fully voiced by Bethesda.
