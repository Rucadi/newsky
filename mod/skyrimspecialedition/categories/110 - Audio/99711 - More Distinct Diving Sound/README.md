Maybe most of you won't notice how low volume of this sfx is as there wasn't many places and oppoturnities you could perform this action with full focus on audio. However, with the recent introduction of mods such as [SkyClimb](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97253), [EVG Animated Traversal Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63232) addon mods,.... My urge to jump from high places into water is much higher than before. But the first time done this, I was disappointed by the sound of water collision, it's more like you drop an apple or a stone into the lake not a person diving into it.
  
  
After some time testing, I finally pinpointed the corresponding audio file for this effect, the volume of it is normal when playing in media player but in game, I can't almost hear anything, even after tweaking the Static Attenuation value of the record in xEdit. So I changed it for a more "realistic" version and amped up the volume without any noticeable distortion in-game. You can see in this comparison video:
  
  
  
  
This is the mod for anyone having similar problem.

**[font=Courier New]Compatibility
  
[/font]**Theoretically, this should be compatible with anything as long as they don't edit the record "CWaterLarge" in "Sound Descriptor" tab or these files in "Data\sound\fx\phy\water": "phy\_water\_h\_01.wav" and "phy\_water\_h\_02.wav".
  
  
Most sound mods I see do not touch these files or record, in case they do then you can check if their sound satisfy you, if yes then you probably don't need this mod. On the other hand, just let my mod overwrite them.
  
  
**[font=Courier New]Known Issues
  
[/font]**1. Sometimes when you jump in shallow water, the sfx for deep water is also played.
  
A: This is because of how Skyrim utilizes sound files and I can't find a way to separate them yet, but don't worry, the sound blends just well.
  
  
2. The sound is delayed.
  
A: This is likely to be script lag if you're running a script-heavy modlist. It can happen to not only this sound but also footstep, armor sound. I tested this in vanilla with no delay but in my modlist, the delay does happen but rarely.
