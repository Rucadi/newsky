**Horse Sound Overhaul**

  
A new mod is neigh (pun very much intended)!
  
  
The original Skyrim horse sounds were quite good, but some of them were spliced pretty awkwardly, especially the injured and death sounds. So, I decided to make my own take on all of the sound, anyway, because sound design is a ton of fun!
  
  
It's also a condensed version of [my old mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/77951) (yes, that account is mine), with no esp files, so it can work seamlessly on both Skyrim LE and SE.
  
  
What does this mod entail? 
  

  
* It's a complete redesign of all horse vocalizations in the game.
Foley is not included. I strongly recommend using [Immersive Sounds - Compendium﻿](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/54387) or [Improved Horse Step Sounds](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/31039). This mod will be fully compatible with either of those.﻿﻿
  
* Used various sounds from sound effects libraries to create a unique set of sounds: **no copyrighted material here!**
Sourced entirely from horses of various breeds, with low neighs for rearups, roars for attacks and squeals for injury and death.
  

If you still need convincing, here's a small taste of what the mod has to offer!
  
  
  
Hope you like it enough to use it in your game! Stay tuned for more creature sound overhauls!
