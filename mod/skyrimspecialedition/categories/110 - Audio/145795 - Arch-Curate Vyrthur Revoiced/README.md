Who is [Arch-Curate Vyrthur](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Arch-Curate_Vyrthur) you may ask? Well he's 1 of 2 living snow elves from the Dawnguard DLC. He's the boss you fight to obtain Auriel's bow. If you still aren't sure who he is, check out the Soundcloud audio and YouTube video below.
  
  
 Just like my [Potema Revoiced mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/123877), I wanted this character to have a unique voice. He's originally voiced (at least in english) by Stephen Russell who has done many voices for many characters in the Bethesda franchise.
  
  
*I'm personally a huge fan of the original Thief trilogy where I first heard him voice the protagonist Garrett.*HOWEVER, Vyrthur is a unique npc with a custom boss fight so I agreed with [levarson](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/levarson)'s suggestion that he should get the same treatment Potema did. Voiced by Andrew Helbig (who worked on my [The Black Door Revoiced mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/91124)) to bring this character to life.

Only requirements are to have Skyrim and the Dawnguard DLC installed to use this mod.
  
This mod is simply loose audio files (.fuz & .lip) so it is safe to add or remove at any time! Ensure it loads after any mods that may alter Arch-Curate Vyrthur's voice. There are a couple of mods out there that apply filters to his voice.﻿
