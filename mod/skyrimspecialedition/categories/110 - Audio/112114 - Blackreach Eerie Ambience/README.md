[font=Georgia]**Blackreach Eerie Ambience** uses [Sound Record Distributor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77815)﻿ to distribute sound effects to the **Blackreach** region. It is compatible with ***almost everything.**
  
![](https://imgur.com/6McrPou.png)*Patches are provided for [Reverb and Ambiance Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53686)﻿. RAO adds a new region for **Blackreach** and then adds that region to its acoustic space. Because of this, users of **RAO** and **BEA** together would experience both mods working ~~intermittently.~~  (boo!)
  
  
The **2** patches provided add the sound fx from **BEA** to the new region from **RAO**, with options to either silence the sounds from **RAO** or use them together.

If you choose to replace the sound loop for Crimson Nirnroots only, there is an included ESL-flagged plugin that edits a ***single vanilla activator record*** to make this happen. It is compatible with everything that does not edit this record, which I am not sure of many that do.[/font]

[font=Georgia]**BEA** gives you the option to silence exploration music *(a.k.a. Dungeon Ice Music)* in **Blackreach**. Since **Blackreach** does not have unique music, using [Music Type Distributor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/119571)﻿ allows the ability to replace the music type by region or location without conflict. Please note that **combat music will still play** unless you have something to replace that.
