(Yes, I know. There is no way this can be considered a "remaster." I just put a lot of work into it and want to feel good, okay?!)
  
  
[Song of the Green (Auri Follower)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11278) is an amazing mod with a cute and lovable follower. I personally can never go on without taking her with me.
  
  
However, as her [author](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/2424584) didn't update the older voice files with the same quality as the newer lines she added, the older lines are full of noise and vary in loudness and clarity. This mod aims to fix that (as much as my skills would allow, which is basically non-existent).
  
  
To sum it up, I used audacity to modify the lines to make them fit, not only with each other, but with the vanilla lines as well. This is applied to all of Auri's available lines, like in the patches included in the [main mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11278?tab=files), and the lines included in [SDA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32161), [Remiel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51874), or [Lucien](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20035)'s mods, for example.
  
  
Take a listen to the before and afters and see if this mod is for you!
  
**Warning: Soundcloud is known for making things rather loud.**

There might be some odd effects or issues but nearly all of them can be attributed to two reasons:
  
  

  
1. They originally had those issues and were probably made worse somehow.
I did actually make a mistake or I didn't give that file its due care.
  

  
  
How I made this mod:
  
  

  
1. Went through all of them, one by one, and cleaned them up.
Used [pyloudnorm](https://pypi.org/project/pyloudnorm/)﻿ configured to normalize the loudness of all files to -20 LUFS.
  
2. I also made a few changes in how long the pauses were. Regenerated almost all of the .lip files to accommodate the changes.
