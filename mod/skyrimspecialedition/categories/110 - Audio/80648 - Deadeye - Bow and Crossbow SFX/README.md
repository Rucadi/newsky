**[Audio Overhaul for Skyrim SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12466) contains VOLUME SLIDERS for magic, weapons and other categories. If you do not like the volume, I highly suggest you install this as it is compatible with Immersive Sounds instead of leaving comments about your ears being hurt. It will spare both you and I a headache.**

**Deadeye** is a nearly complete replacer for bow and arrow audio, carefully tailored to provide a unique, impactful experience for archers. Arrows will now whistle past and make tangible, audible impacts upon flesh targets so that you know when you've hit your mark.
  
  
Deadeye, like most of my mods, works far better when [Immersive Sounds - Compendium](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/523) is installed, so I highly recommend installing it and loading Deadeye below any other mods that affect bows or crossbows.﻿
  
**HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: [Dynamic Impacts by Goshbrindal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/140320) pairs PERFECTLY with my sound effects. Make sure to use the AOS-ISC version for my recommended setup.**
  
  
As with my recent mods I haven't been able to get an ingame showcase, so here's a soundcloud playlist containing some of Deadeye's sounds. Please note that Soundcloud has a habit of butchering audio so download the files if need be to listen to them:
