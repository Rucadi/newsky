I was playing the Dragonborn DLC and arrived to this point in the Retaking Thirsk side quest. Hrothmund's Spirit sounded like it was just a regular guy standing next to me. Checked the Nexus and didn't see any mods so I figured I'd change it. Simple edits to 6 files.

Loose audio (fuz) files only. Zero esp. Install with any mod manager or manually extract. Safe to add or remove at any time.

The character doesn't exist in-game, I added him in via console and equipped him for the screenshots.
