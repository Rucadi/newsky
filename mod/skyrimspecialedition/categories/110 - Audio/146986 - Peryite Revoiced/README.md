Peryite's voice never matched "the Daedric god of pestilence" for me. I had the idea that Gravemind from Halo would be a perfect fit and Markalanvoices agreed to help me make a proximal revoice for the character. He now sounds more foreboding and guttural. Comes with a patches  for [The Only Cure - Quest Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57683)﻿, [Daedric Voices](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32090), and [AFDI - Aetherium Forge Destroys Items](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/114021)﻿﻿ mods.

Zero requirements. This mod is simple loose audio files in .fuz format. Ensure it loads after any other mods that may alter these. No ESP, safe to add or remove at any time.
