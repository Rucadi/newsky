This mod aims to improve the experience of the mod by providing new, high quality, dialogue recordings for the Olenveld mod.
  
  
Olenveld Revoiced is a project that exists because I felt that the voice acting in the original release in the mod didn't live up to what it could've been. So with the permission of [F0RCEFI3LD](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/F0RCEFI3LD?gameId=1704) we re-recorded the dialogue from Olvenveld and released it as an addition to the original mod so as not the disrespect the work of the original cast.
  
Some characters have been re-cast and will have a new voice, others have had their original VA's reprise their original role, but where advised and directed by a professional audio engineer and voice actor to improve the quality of their recordings.
  
  
My immense gratitude goes out the the people that made this possible!

**What is Community Voices?**Community Voices adopts the Cathedral modding principles of an open, joint effort by the community,
  
for the community, specific to voice acting. It breathes new life into mods that weren't voiced in
  
the first place or otherwise may not have had the best mic quality to work with at the time.
  
  
After Working with [Craftian](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Craftian?gameId=1704) on his first Community Voices mod and realising this mod follows the same principles, I've decided to rename it to reflect that!
