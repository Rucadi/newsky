AUDIO REPLACER FOR MENUS, CRAFTING, UI SOUNDS.
  
This mod will enhance the most important feature in Skyrim -The Interface sounds.
  
*Opening your menu will sound organic. Leveling up will sound more fantasy.*
  
**No more loud thumping and loud chanting.
  
No over the top techno or synths either.**
  
Sounds are more soft and pleasing.
  
Even the worldmap feels like nature
  
Inspired by other RPGs like Dragons Dogma.
  
+1 immersion.
