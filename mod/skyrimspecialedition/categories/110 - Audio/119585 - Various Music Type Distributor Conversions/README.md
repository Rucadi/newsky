Some conversions for the recent [Music Type Distributor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/119571) mod by ThirdEye3301 which will hopefully put the sometimes tedious task of creating music merges and patches a thing of the past  :)
  
  
Music Type Distributor is a mod that allows you to dynamically add music to the games Track Lists at run time, instead of needing to do so in a plugin/patch.
  
  
Since i have seen asked fairly often, this can be used with Lorkhan, because it uses loose music files to replace the original music, you can use it and any combination of mods that support Music Type Distributor with no issues.
  
  
I will only be updating the AIO from this point onwards.
  
  
**----- LIGHTING MODS -----**
  
Because i have edited some of the zone music around Winterhold so it plays more magic themed music around the area i have had to modify some world cells.  There is a patch included for both Lux and Skyrim is Luminous.  ELFX does not appear to require a patch at this stage.
  
  
For any other mods or such the user [SvkHazra](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/23538009) has created a patcher for Synthesis that will forward all the lighting cells whilst keeping the zone music changes intact, which you can find here: <https://github.com/souvikhazra1/KmrMusicCellsPatcher-Synthesis>
  
  
  
**----- IMPORTANT PLEASE READ -----**
  
Some music mods are based on the "Personal Music List" mod, which means they share file names and paths, causing them to overwrite each other. In order to prevent the files overlapping you will need to manually download and move some of the files of these mods into the directories outlined below, so you can use multiples of them at the same time.
  
  
**3.0 Update Note:** As of 3.0 i have removed the ability to use one as a standalone, was just getting too much of a pain to manage.  So as of 2.0 the manual method of moving files is the only one supported, as it is the most popular option and allowed people to use multiple of these mods together with ease.
  
  
Please read the following instructions on how to organize the files for each mod this step should be done before you install this mod.
  
  
**Vindsvept:**
  
Download the main file from [Vindsvept](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19813). Move the Music folder contents from the mod to Data\Music\Vindsvept
  
  
**Emeratu:**

Note: You do not need to download the Personalized Music mod required by the original mod, this pack already includes a customized version.
  
  
As of 3.0 i have also added three generic placeholder mods that use the same file structure as the "Personal Music List" mod.  So if a music mod you want to use uses this as a base and is not specifically supported above you can copy and paste the music files into one of the three supported folders below.
  
  
Custom Trackset #1:
  
Move the Music folder contents from the mod to Data\Music\KSRMusic1
  
  
Custom Trackset #2:
  
Move the Music folder contents from the mod to Data\Music\KSRMusic2
