Have you ever wondered how combat music works in Skyrim? MUSCombat is a special record that plays when combat starts. As such, any mod that adds new combat music needs to interact with that record in some way. This is troublesome, and not just for the obvious direct conflicts.
  
  
Several mods, like Extended Cut: Saints and Seducers, try to have unique combat music in their regions. This is very easy to achieve, and requires minimal patching. However, making vanilla combat music not play during  those cases very quickly devolves into patch hell.
  
  
Enter Combat Music Extender. Combat Music Extender attempts to solve this issue by intelligently selecting appropriate music tracks from configuration files. Additionally, while not technically combat music, you can also change the location cleared sound in the same way (also hardcoded, like MUSCombat).

**Requirements and runtimes:**
  
1. Skyrim SE version 1.6.1130+
  
2. [Skyrim Script Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30379)﻿
  
3. [Address Library for SKSE Plugins](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444)﻿
  
  
**A note on the Address Library:** 
  
This mod needs the *All in one Address Library (Anniversary Edition) version,* regardless of whether or not you have purchased the AE DLC.
  
  
**A note on runtime:** 
  
As stated above, this requires Skyrim SE version 1.6.1130+, sometimes called Skyrim AE. Please do not ask me to support older versions, I don't want to have multiple Skyrim installations.
