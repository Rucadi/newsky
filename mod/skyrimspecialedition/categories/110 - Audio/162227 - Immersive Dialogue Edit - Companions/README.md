Immersive Dialogue Edit: Companions

  

(Sorry anbeegod, I realized you were using a similar name for your new series after I made this, I swear!)

  
  
**IDE: Companions** is a lightweight mod that adjusts some dialogue for improved player immersion. This is **not** a dialogue expansion, but it is compatible with any dialogue expansions you may already use! The goal of this mod is simple: identify lines of dialogue that don't quite fit (either due to alternate start mods, generic audio lines, or other variables) and adjust them - prioritizing splicing when feasible, but using AI when it's not. However, nearly all AI-voiced dialogue is done using a voice changer over my own actual performance of the lines, and is inter-spliced with original dialogue, so they are much more expressive than the average AI voices.
  
  
The mod is currently made up of four fixes:
  
  
Alternate start consistency:
  
SpoilerAdjusts Eorlund's line "And dragons were just stories. And the elves once ruled Skyrim", removing the first half if "Dragon Rising" has not yet been completed.
  
  
  
  
Player Achievement Recognition:
  
SpoilerAdjusts the dialogue between Vilkas and Kodlak when you first join depending on if you've done anything of note (currently, checks if you are Thane of any hold, if you have completed "Dragon Rising", if you are the Arch-Mage of Winterhold, if you are a member of the Dawnguard, or if you have a positive relationship with Vilkas through another mod).
  
  
  
  
My home is Jorrvaskr (marriage dialogue tweaks):
  
SpoilerAdjusts the marriable companions' dialogue so that they don't offer to let you stay at "their place". Instead, they'll suggest you move back to Jorrvaskr.
  
  
  
  
Generic follower dialogue fixes:
  
SpoilerAdjusts generic follower dialogue to better match the individual's personality. Currently, this only affects Njada's line, "Friends like you are hard to find and very valuable to me." She now makes a comment more in-character.
  
  
  
  
This mod may grow in the future - please feel free to suggest any other lines you feel are out of place!
