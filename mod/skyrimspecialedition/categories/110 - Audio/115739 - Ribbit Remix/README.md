In **V****anilla Skyrim**, there are **3** sound markers used for frog loops. There is a total of **4** sounds added to those sound markers, and then they are placed throughout **the Reach, Pine Forest, and Fall Forest** in **72** different locations. These sounds will also only play at night from **10**pm to **5**am.

**Ribbit Remix** aims to add some much-needed variety & depth to these frog sounds, *without* replacing all **72** markers (just most of them). I wanted to keep some of the vanilla sounds in place while also adding to the ***pool of toads.***
  
There are **26** new frog & toad sounds added to **22** sound markers. These sounds will play at varied times of day, so you won't just hear frogs at night. 
  
  
Simple FOMOD Installer included to allow you to choose from higher quality .wav files, or lower quality .xwm files. 
  
  
If you think this mod is ***TOADALLY*** awesome, then please endorse!
