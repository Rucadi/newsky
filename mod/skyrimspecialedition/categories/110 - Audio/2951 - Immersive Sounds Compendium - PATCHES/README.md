This is the separated **patch section** for [Immersive Sounds Compendium.](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/523/) Any compatibility patches that might end up being needed for other mods will end up for download here as they are needed. Instead of bundling patches within the main mod package and its installer as was previously done, this method allows me to much more fluidly add and update individual patches without needing to change and reupload the main package. This should be more convenient both for me and the end user.
  
   
The version numbers specified for individual patch downloads are based on the current versions of the respective parent mods at the time the patches were created. If a mod has since been updated, and the version number here no longer reflects the latest number of the mod itself, then **don't worry about it!** It is very rare that a problem occurs making the patch no longer work as intended, as the kind of records these patches edit and merge are usually not changed often at all. Should that situation still occur in spite of the odds, you can make a report in the comments and I will probably get around to adressing it.
  
   
As a general rule, **the worst thing you can expect from a potential conflict/incompatibility is that the new ISC audio functiality may be missing on specific items** (provided that the plugins are ahead of Immersive Sounds - Compendium.esp in the load order as they should). Conflicts of such a trivial nature **will NOT break your game** or even compromise your gameplay.
