**[font=Trebuchet MS]DESCRIPTION[/font]**
  
  
*When the talented Tsadokiel voiced Mihail's [Talkative Dragon-Priests](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/83735) into French, there were unused takes in dovahzul, but they were too good to go to waste. I got the idea to add them to the draugr to expand their combat lines, inspired by great mods like [Bandit Lines Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63733), and then I wrote new lines for him to voice, hence this mod.*
  
  
In Skyrim, the draugr have 6 noises and 10 lines in dovahzul for attack only. With this mod, they will have **33 more lines** in dovahzul, distributed into vanilla combat/detection dialogue categories. They're based on a chance (like a dice roll) ranged from 75% so they won't appear too often or repeat themselves too much. *See the details below.*
  
*All the lines have been checked and rectified by **Kahvozein**, our lore and linguistics specialist. Dovahzul grammar and pronunciation are sometimes debatable, so please be lenient :)*
  
  
[font=Trebuchet MS]**NOTES**[/font]
  
  
The new lines only apply to the vanilla draugr race. For example, it will affect the variants from [Skyrim Immersive Creatures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12680), but not the new undead types from [D.E.A.D. - Draugr Enemy Asset Diversity](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/112431) (which is logical as they're not part of the Dragon Cult). Let me know if patches need to be made.
  
  
If you use a replacer for draugr audio, it may sound inconsistent without a patch. The lines are tuned for vanilla audio (HQ and stereo). The difference when vanilla attack and custom taunt lines are rapidly alternating is, of course, perceptible, but not very much of a problem, in my opinion.
