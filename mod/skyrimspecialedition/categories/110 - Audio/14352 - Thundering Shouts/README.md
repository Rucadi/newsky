The mod changes shout audio for both male and female in the following ways:
  
  
-All shouts have pitch lowered by 10%,with few exceptions for orcs and female argonians
  
 ﻿ ﻿-Second and third word of power have echo, most of them have thunder in the background aswell

Use either Vortex/M02/NMM to install or just place the files provided in the data folder And let it overwrite if needed. Only download one of the files.
  
  
I have included two files, one with 10% lowered pitch and one version with normal pitch.
  
The ESPs are marked as ESL so they dont take load order slot
