Hired the excellent VA Abigail Reno to revoice Meridia. You'll find her to have a less harsh, more calming, and maybe a little alluring voice.

Comes in 2 versions. The main version is voice only. The 2nd or "Alt" version has some background twinkling sounds to be somewhat similar to the original.
  
Like my previous voice mods, this does not have an ESP, it's loose files. Make sure this mod overwrites any others that alter Meridia's voice.
  
Safe to install/uninstall at any time.
