**Dungeon Sounds Overhaul
  
Version 2.0**
  
Requires [Sound Record Distributor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77815)﻿
  
 *Completely rebuilt from scratch.*
  
 
  
Dungeon Sounds Overhaul V2.0 comes with a highly modular FOMOD, so you can make your
  
dungeons how you want them (hopefully!)
  
  
FOMOD Features:
  
Default Plugin & Sounds (Now ESL)
  
Includes common dungeon sounds like rocks falling, dust & debris, bats & rats, interior fort winds, and ice cracking in ice caves.

Eerie or Terror sounds placed in dungeons, caves, forts, & mines.
  
Terror will include things like creature growls and agonizing screams in Nordic Ruins. Eerie gears more towards ghostly breaths and effects.
  
Select none if you only want the default common sounds.

The next step allows you to choose your generic dungeon loop for Catacombs, Caves, Ice Caves, Forts
  
& Mines, and Dwemer (silent only option for now). You can also choose to silence any or all generic
  
loops (my personal preference).

Next you can choose to make your dungeons nearly silent. I like to silence everything except for
  
doorways.

in this mod is dark and drone-based. You can replace, add, or silence dungeon music, or you can simply keep vanilla as is.

Because it's impossible to capture everything in a showcase, here are a few examples of what you can do.
