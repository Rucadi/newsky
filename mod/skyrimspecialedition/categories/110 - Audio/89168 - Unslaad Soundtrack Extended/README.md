Alongside my soundtrack extension for[Vigilant](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89102)﻿﻿﻿ comes Unslaad. This mod aims to do exactly the same thing; extend some of the shorter tracks from the mod to make them a bit longer reducing the gaps and silence during longer sequences/fights.
  
  
Almost all music has been edited with the exceptions of the ending themes as it's not necessary to make a loop out of those particular tracks. Most tracks now average from around 2~ minutes to anywhere between 4 and 5 minutes resulting in fewer jarring gaps in the music. As with the previous project, some loops are more seamless than others but I've done my best and hopefully you won't notice the loops, and I'm generally quite happy with the end result. [This is always relevant however.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNtsRwaVBs4)
  
There is an optional file with a remastered version of one of the boss themes (you can find out which one by previewing file contents) which was found on the original composers website called "Nameless Knight". I think I actually prefer the structure of the original but the newer version is also very cool so it's there if desired. This is referred to as "Remastered" in optional files. https://makai-symphony.com/
