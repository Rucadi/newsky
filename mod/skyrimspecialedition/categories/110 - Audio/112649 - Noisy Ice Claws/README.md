Requires [Ice Claws](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53219)﻿!

Very simple addition to the wonderful Ice Claws. I had seen requests for the addition of a sound pop up from time to time and thought, why not?
  
  
So this will add a looping ambient sound to Ice Claws similar to the sound Nirnroot produces.
  
  
Should make them easier to find and harder to miss, if that's an issue you've had.

Flagged as ESL.
  
  
The original mod named each version's ESP differently. I've made a version for each, so check which one you have and download accordingly.
  
  
Thanks to [Jxudo](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/4779994)﻿ for creating the sound.
