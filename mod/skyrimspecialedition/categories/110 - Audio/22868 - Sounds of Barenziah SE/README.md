# Sounds of Barenziah SE
- Author: Pharros
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

This is a port of [Pharros'](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/19851709) mod, [Sounds of Barenziah](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/76069). The permissions from that mod state:
  
"You may do what you wish with the file as long as you credit me and don't distribute it on a separate mod hosting platform."
  
Thus, permission is open to port this mod to SSE here on the Nexus.
  
  
Since the FOMOD still works great and has everything from all of the mod's possible versions, I've just left that one up - there's no reason for the separate files.
  
I followed the [How to port (almost) and Oldrim mod to Skyrim SE (for dummies](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17990) guide. (Though all that had to be done was re-saving the 8 potential ESPs)
  
  
Here's the original description of the mod:
  
  
**DESCRIPTION**
  
This is a small mod that adds two custom sound effects to the Stones of Barenziah: one for locational sound (similar to how Nirnroot sound is emitted) and one for picking up the Stone. This mod is meant to make it a little easier to find the Stones of Barenziah without giving away their exact locations. Sounds of Barenziah works especially well for no-quest-marker playthroughs too :)
  
  
Examples of the sound effects:

[size=3]**REQUIREMENTS**
  
Skyrim (1.5.62.0.8) or greater.
  
(Technically it should work perfectly fine on even the earliest version of SE but just covering my bases here)
  
  
**COMPATIBILITY**May not be compatible with mods that modify TGCrownGemActivator. (I don't know of any mod that does, should be compatible with every mod)
  
  
Compatible with [Stones of Barenziah Quest Markers](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/9385/?).
  
Compatible with [Audio Overhaul of Skyrim 2](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/43773/?).
  
Incompatible with [Sound of Barenziah](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/16018/?) since it does the exact same thing, except uses the vanilla Nirnroot sound instead of my custom sound. Pick whichever one of these two mods you'd prefer.
  
  
Highly recommended:
  
[Barenziah's Glory SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6343)
  
  
**CREDITS**Sound Jay for the magical sounds.
  
SkyrimFantom for the mystical sounds.
  
Cash Money for the Bling Bling sounds.

[size=3]**NOTES**[/size]I am **not** an experienced modder by any stretch of the imagination! I'm not aware of a lot of best practices, technical details and am not the original author of the mod. If you notice anything strange or off - missing metadata, unsorted masters, weirdness in the loose files, FOMOD or ESPs, **let me know!** I will do my best to correct these after learning more about them. Heck, if you just know a cleaner, better way to implement any of this, I'd love to know.
  
  
Feedback is always appreciated!
  
  
(It's also possible I mixed up one of the ESPs while converting them and moving them into the FOMOD. Let me know if I did, I'll fix it.)[/size]
