Customizable alternative to [Quiet Dog](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6066) animation replacer mod. Make sure you don't use this mod at the same time with mine or dogs will be unimmersively quiet in your game! 
  
  
Unlike with original [Quiet Dog](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6066), with this mod certain types of barking won't be forever rendered out of existence. With my simple mod you can just disable (or reduce frequency of) barking for your current dog followers and keep it for all the other dogs in game. Especially useful with bandit owned dogs - you will be able to hear them from a far. If you left your canine follower to wait, barking will be activated to make it easier to find your dog on a way back.
  
  
**NEW!** Optional download with silent audio files to replace all CC Bone Wolf audio effects (no OAR required for it too work, it is just audio files).

* You can install this mod during playthrough and disable or uninstall or reinstall or update at any time as well!
Silencing will work even if you have [Realistic Husky Sounds SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11038/) or [Realistic Dog Sounds SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35894)

This mod works without Nemesis or FNIS. [Open Animation Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92109) needed only - both SE and AE versions of DAR will be able to play this animations

At any time in your playthrough you can modify OAR conditions. Use provided descriptiona in OAR interface as a reference.
  

**If during/after installation some sort of error pops up or animations in your game can`t play and you see static pose instead:**
