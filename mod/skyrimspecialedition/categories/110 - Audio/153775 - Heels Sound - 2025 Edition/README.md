High quality heels sound 2025 remake, balanced distribution, carefully tweaked volume. 
  
Say byebye to the old ear-killer sound effects! 
  
  
**This mod can be used to replace the old "Heels Sound SSE" mod, you do not need any other heels sound mod!**
  
  
Benefits of this mod:
  
**1. Compatible with mods that need the old "Heels Sound SSE"**
  
Any framework/clothing mods that work with the old version, works fine with this mod 
  
  
**2. Balanced volume**
  
Each type of ground material has a specific sound effect, and no material will produce significantly louder footstep sound than other ground materials.
  
  
**3. Consistency and more types of sound.**
  
No rock sounds on grass ground, no snow sounds on carpet ground.........
  
Metal footstep sound is also added!
  
  
**4. More realistic sound**
  
Thanks to DRELADWYN and fkrcjf77, I have the access to 2 decent sound banks. 
  
The footstep sounds now sound more realistic too!
  
  
Fully covered sound types after V 2.0 :
  
**Stone, wood, carpet, dirt,  grass, metal, snow**
  
Partially covered:
  
**Ice，[color=#a64d79]gravel[/color]**
  
  
The sound on snow is generally tweaked quieter, since loud snow crunching sounds are not ideal for gameplay.
  
  
  
  
  
**Special thanks to Heels Sound SSE original Mod Author**
