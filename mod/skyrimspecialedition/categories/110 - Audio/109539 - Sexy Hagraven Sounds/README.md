[﻿](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1Sr5FAJze0)That's much it. Download it and install it to hear what I'm talking about! This audio mod was made with PS Boss New Hagraven and Sexy Hagraven mods in mind. Vanilla Hagraven sounds are just eerie and not fitting at all what those mods change. So this mod is a complement. Honestly, it's not NSFW or has any swearing of anything like that. Soon I'll upload a video so you can listen and decide if this mod was meant for you or not. 
  
  
The 2.0 version is up and I removed those unimmersive p\*rn sounds! They totally break immersion and I looked for better, fitting sounds. I hope, I HOPE these newer death and injured sounds make up for the NSFW previous version!
  
  
As promised, you can watch a video on how this mod sounds:
