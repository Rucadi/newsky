[font=Trebuchet MS]A Remaster Of it s Predecessor [Bow Before The Dead - Draugr Sounds Legacy Edition -](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23419)﻿
  
a full replacement for Vanilla Draugrs sounds to a more fearsome and Demonic Sounds FX / Voices Reworked From Scratch which means new Sound FX and more talking. Maybe laughing too, ~~a lot of it in fact!~~**Update 5 Available
  
Added Some new effects and fixes while also greatly reducing the laughing!
