**The Northerner Diaries - Immersive Edition
  
[size=3]
  
[/size]**This mod adds a number of songs from Jeremy Soule's *The Northerner Diaries* as exploration tracks in Skyrim and Solstheim. Thought has been put into the choice of tracks and playlists to ensure your immersion is never ruined by inappropriately-placed music.
  
  
[size=3](Soule's bandcamp has been totally obliterated. The album is still available on [amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Northerner-Diaries-Symphonic-Sketches/dp/B07F3MZFSQ)﻿ in reduced quality.)[/size]
  
  
**Features:**
  
  

  
* **HD (192kbps) audio**, same as the SSE High Quality Music patch - the maximum allowed bitrate for Skyrim audio files.

﻿

  
* **Lossless source audio.** The files in this mod have been converted directly from the source FLACs to maintain fidelity as much as possible.

﻿

  
* **8 carefully hand-picked songs from the album.** The remaining 5 did not make the cut for a number of reasons, mostly because I felt they didn't fit as mellow exploration tracks for Skyrim, such as Bifrost, which sounds like the opening track for a 90s Christmas movie.

﻿

  
* **Minimal edits.** Jafnan was edited to remove the opening drum riff, because blaring drums are the last thing you want to hear while sneaking through Skyrim's shadowed forests. Ginnung was edited to remove the fanfare towards the end of the track, and the result was split into two separate tracks.

﻿

  
* **Affects both Skyrim and Solstheim.** For Solstheim, only the Mountain and Snow playlists have been edited. Solstheim General (which usually plays updated versions of Morrowind music) was not touched, to preserve the ashlands atmosphere.

﻿

  
* **Immersive time of day & location categorization.** Some tracks only play during sunset, others only at night, others only in the morning. Each music region has been carefully considered.

  
I used the [Yakitori Audio Converter](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/73100)﻿ to convert the original bandcamp .flac files to .wxm. 
  
  
This mod is incompatible with any other mod that edits vanilla Skyrim music types. That includes my other music mod, [Solstheim Soundtracks in Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21439). Use a bashed patch, or take 5 mins to make a manual patch in SSEdit.
