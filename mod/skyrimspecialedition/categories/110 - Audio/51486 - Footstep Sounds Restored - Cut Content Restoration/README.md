This mod was a lot of tedious and boring work﻿ and making it was no fun at all, but somebody had to do it one day, right? The mod changes or adds around 310 entries, just so you have an understanding of how big this is. You can look at the screenshot of the SSEDIT entries if you want to get an overview of what this mod changes. To alleviate my pain and suffering I would be very glad if you could leave an endorsement if you like the mod.
  
  
**Details**[size=3]
  
Skyrim contains a vast amount of footstep sound assets that sadly go unused in vanilla.They are all high quality but propably didn't make it into the final game due to time constraints, some descriptors were already set up while others were missing, it looks like the sounds got made some time during development but they forgot to include them all. This ranges from sounds for all the armor classes (Heavy, Light, Skaal, Barefoot) to the sound they make on different surfaces (Dirt, Grass, Gravel, Snow, Ice, Stone, Wood, Sand, Ash etc.) in combination with the respective movement type(Sneak, Walk, Run, Sprint)[size=5]. It's really a lot that was missing, for example vanilla skyrim only has the armor sound rustling for sprinting, but not really anywhere else even though high quality sounds were provided for almost all surfaces and movement types. NPCs didn't use sprinting sounds at all, the player mostly had no walking sounds for anything, but instead the run sound, other movement types like sneak were often completely forgotten and used NPC walk etc etc. I'm too tired to give a detailed changelog, but you can watch the comparison videos to get an idea, or look at SSEDIT to \*see\* the audio. The sounds in the video are by no means all though, just download the mod and try it for yourself, you won't regret it.[/size]

Propably works if you load it after
  
**Immersive Sounds - Compendium
  
or Audio Overhaul for Skyrim SE**
  
worst case is some sounds from those mods won't get overwritten, just tell me in the comments if you have any problems.
