# M'aiq The Liar Anniversary Edition (aka Modder's Edition)
- Author: Dahveed
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

A long-overdue upgrade for M'aiq the Liar I threw together in a few hours of messing around with [SKVA Synth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44184) by DanRuta.
  
  
Adds 31 new lines of wink-at-the-player dialogue centered (mostly) around Skyrim modding.  Also, Ma'iq will now say up to 6 lines of dialogue at a time before getting "tired".  (He will still randomly say his original lines.)

Khajiit wishes you well.
