I was tired of the vanilla sound as its sound was terrible. I searched many free sound sfx sites and after downloading quite a few I felt this one was the best. The sound is subtle and it doesn't ring as often.
  
  
It's a sound replacer for the Nirnroot, I don't have a picture for it and I don't have a video for it either. It is a small and easy download to try out for yourself.
  
  
 [website to hear the sound](https://clyp.it/j0x43yqj)   .... I hope this link works to test out the sound. Kinda new to posting mods. Good at using them though.
  
  
  
  
I hope you guys like it as much as I do. Cheers.
  
  
  
  
  
For now this mod page is small and boring but if I need to I will try to make it more interesting. Now excuse me while I keep searching Nexus for more mods to try.  cya :)
  
  
V 1.1 Edit... I made a change to directory by adding Data folder, maybe this was why some were having in install issue.
  
  
V 1.12 New FOMOD installer to play nice with Immersive Sounds Compendium and including a vanilla install. Thank you very much to DofD who supplied the installer to help others. Cheers :)
