﻿Potema always sounded too "nice". She's regarded as unambiguously evil per the Skyrim lore. So this mod aims to fix that. Originally voiced by Claudia Ann Christian, and while she did a great job, in true Bethesda fashion her voice was over-used so I always thought of Aela when hearing Potema speak. Some lines were also difficult to understand or hear correctly due to the reverb/echo effects used.

No ESP, just loose audio files. Safe to add or remove at any time. Use the mod manager of your choice or drop the contents of the zip file into your Data folder.
  
Comes in WAV format by default, but there is an optional FUZ for download too. Make sure it loads after [Unofficial High Definition Audio Project](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18115) and [Phoenix Compendium](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55221) if you have those mods installed. Conflicts or overwrites will only show if using the FUZ files.
