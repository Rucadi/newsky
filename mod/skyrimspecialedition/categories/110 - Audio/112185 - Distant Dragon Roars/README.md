Simple mod that takes vanilla distant dragon roars and adds them to exterior regions as ambient sounds. 
  
  
V1.1 Adds optional version to stop sounds from playing after the main quest "Dragonslayer" is completed. 
  
  
Chance to trigger .007, licensed to kill. This should space out the sounds enough so they don't play too often. 
  
This mod doesn't add any new sounds. It takes the distant dragon roars attached to NPC dragons and adds them as ambient sounds to the environment.
