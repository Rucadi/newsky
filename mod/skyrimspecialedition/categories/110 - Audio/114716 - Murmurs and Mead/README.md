In vanilla Skyrim, there is a single tavern loop that plays from 8pm to 2am in 13 locations. You may or may not have noticed it, but it's a generic loop of loud chatter that sounds very out of place. USSEP increases the volume of this loop by decreasing its static attenuation to 0.
  
  
Murmurs & Mead uses [Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805)﻿ to give each tavern & inn a unique loop, focusing on subtlety and realism.

**Next you have 2 options for your SWAP.ini**
  
  
The ***default locations*** are the 13 taverns & inns that already have the tavern loop sound marker. This will simply swap those for new sound markers.
  
  
The ***default locations plus*** will include all 13 default locations, plus the 6 inns without the default sound marker. For these locations, I have swapped out a random bottle of mead or basic tankard for the new sound marker.

About New Sound Loops:[/b]
  
Each location has been taken into consideration when creating these loops. Some locations will sound similar with specific nuances that will differentiate them. They are meant to be subtle while still keeping the feel of a lively tavern or inn.
  
  
You can hear faint wind (using alongside [Nordic Winds](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/112370) will have matching interior & exterior wind loops for most), creaking wood, tankards & cast iron pots, human sounds like coughing, clearing throats, & sniffling, chairs dragging on wood & stone, coins & bottles dropping, etc... Muffled conversations & murmurs are limited to locations with 2 floors or big spaces like the Silver-Blood Inn.

**Last step gives you options to replace a few vanilla sounds.** 
  
  
The ***Exterior tavern loop marker*** is placed outside of 11 taverns in Vanilla Skyrim. The new sounds are more subtle than vanilla. 
  
  
There are 2 options to***replace the campfire & fireplace loop*****.** Please note that this changes the sound of all campfires, including outdoors. 
  
  
As always, there's an option to ***mute the music*** by replacing the tavern files with blank wav files.

**![](https://imgur.com/nU22kYD.png)****Miscellaneous Note:**
  
I made this mod with[AI Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21654)﻿ in mind to fill taverns with vanilla NPCs during evening hours.
  
I don't usually add many new NPCs to my game, but these loops may still fit well with mods that do exactly that. Or maybe they don't...
