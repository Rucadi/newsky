**The first step above will install the main plugin (esl), sounds, and yaml file. Requires [Sound Record Distributor.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77815)﻿
  
  
Sounds include Hermaeus Mora ambient dialogue, pages rustling, books falling, creatures gurgling, footsteps﻿ eerily walking, and voices whispering.**

**Next you can choose from a selection of sound replacers.****You can choose to silence wind gusts, replace them with something new, or keep them vanilla.
  
Choose to replace the Paper Twister loop with something a little more eerie or keep it vanilla.
  
Wind Loops are complicated for Apocrypha. Wind loops in this section will only affect the interior dungeons of Apocrypha. See the Base Object Swapper section for more information.﻿****I personally recommend the Dark Drone loop.

In this next section, you can choose to silence more sounds.
  
  
The music for Apocrypha is dark and sinister and actually suits this mod well. However, it's best to use the silent or vanilla wind loops if you plan to keep the music. ﻿Mute the music when using dark drones loops (recommended!)
  
  
You can silence Apocrypha thunder, which will be present in both exterior and interior spaces. 
  
  
You can also choose to silence the sounds in the "random" folder. These are bumper tracks (9-14 seconds in length, usually played with a low-key string instrument or synthesizer, I think).
  
  
I prefer to silence everything.

**Base Object Swapper Options (Please read carefully!)﻿****Vanilla Skyrim uses multiple wind loops at the same time for interior dungeons of Apocrypha. The first wind loop is the one you have already selected in the FOMOD at this point.
  
  
The other wind loops are added to sound markers and placed throughout both interior and exterior locations of Apocrypha. These sound markers are commonly placed around all of Skyrim as well. [Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805)﻿ allows the changing of these specific sound markers in Apocrypha without touching any vanilla records. 
  
  
The sound descriptor applied to the new sound marker will be the same wind loop that you chose previously in this FOMOD. It'll either be dark drone, silent, or vanilla. Please note that if you selected "Silent" as your wind loop, the secondary wind loop will automatically stay silent, regardless of what you choose in this step. 
  
  
I personally prefer to enable the dark drone loop in the first step and then use the Silent Interiors and Drone Exteriors option here. This will silence the secondary wind loop for interiors while also replacing the exterior loops with the same dark drone. 
  
  
The videos will explain more.
