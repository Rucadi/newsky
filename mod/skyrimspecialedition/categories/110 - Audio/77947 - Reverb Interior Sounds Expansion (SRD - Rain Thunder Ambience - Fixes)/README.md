**DESCRIPTION**
  
ㅤ
  
Reverb Interior Sounds Expansion is a thoughtful, vanilla-friendly extension of base game reverb models and interior ambience – powered by Sound Record Distributor and inspired by my previous work on [Audio Overhaul for Skyrim SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12466/). Beyond reverb, this mod adds subtle interior ambience, extends ambience across different regions, makes improvements the most common vanilla output models, and "fixes" some bugs present in the base game.
  
  
New audio was also created specifically for the purpose of this mod.
  
  
By design, it is **highly compatible** and has safety-checks in for the most popular weather mods.
  
Plays nicely with both the base game and Audio Overhaul for Skyrim users. Remember to check your volume sliders!

**CHANGES**
  
ㅤ
  
**REMODELED AND IMPROVED REVERB PROFILES** – Most vanilla reverb models have been reworked and extended to account for room size, surface material, and to better differentiate certain interiors from each other. 
  
  
**EXTERIOR REVERB**  – Introduces newly added reverb to exteriors to simulate sounds bouncing off of outside surfaces, like houses, rocks, caves, and more. This is subtle, but noticeable during moments of low activity and light ambience.
  
  
**INTERIOR AMBIENCE** – New interior sounds have been added that reflects the current weather, such as wind during snowstorms, rain and thunder during rain storms, and small ambient creaks to small interiors like houses and mines. Certain interiors will now better reflect their environment, and care has been taken to ensure the newly added sounds don't feel repetitive or intrusive.
  
  
**MOD SUPPORT** – If you have [Regional Sounds Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77829) installed, additional sounds from that mod will be patched into the remodeled region records at runtime. This is done automatically, does not require you to download a compatibility patch, and is highly recommended.
  
  
**IMPROVED OUTPUT MODELS** – "Under-the-hood", minor changes and fixes have been made to the existing sound output models in vanilla. NPCs voices will travel slightly further, but at the rate of a logarithmic falloff curve to compensate. The reverb send of these models have been made slightly quieter to take into account the changes made.
  
  
  
  
  
**COMPARISON WITH OTHER MODS AVAILABLE**
  
ㅤ
  
Unfortunately, there will be several comparisons made between this and what's currently available.
  
Here are some differences between this mod and [Reverb and Ambience Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/701).
  
  
 ﻿   ■  **Singular focused** – as few edits and features as possible to accommodate all users.
  
 ﻿   ■  Correct reverb models that account for size and material.
  
 ﻿   ■  Less send, resulting in a clearer and less washed-out sound.
  
 ﻿   ■  Less repetitive sounds with a lower chance of overlapping.
  
 ﻿   ■  No ambience designed and intended for exteriors in interiors.
  
           ■  No dungeon cave tones in exteriors.
  
           ■  No dungeon cave tones in stone houses.
  
 ﻿   ■  New sounds specifically designed for interior playback.
  
 ﻿   ■  Fewer bugs and oversights compared to alternatives.
  
  
Out of interest, certain features have been lifted from Reverb Ambience Overhaul (but modified and improved).
  
As an example, Ratway in Riften now has extended ambience to differentiate itself from Imperial Forts.
