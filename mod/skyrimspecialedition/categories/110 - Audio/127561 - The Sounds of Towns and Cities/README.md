[font=Georgia]**STC uses carefully placed sound markers in all towns, cities, and villages. Using this method ensures the sounds are heard where they are meant to be heard and at a specific distance.**[/font]
  
  
[font=Georgia]**However, Sound Markers have a problem with meeting conditions dynamically, so a cell change or save/reload may be required in order for the sounds attached to markers to work properly.
