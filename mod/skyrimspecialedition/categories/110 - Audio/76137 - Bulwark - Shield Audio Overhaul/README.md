**[Audio Overhaul for Skyrim SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12466) contains VOLUME SLIDERS for magic, weapons and other categories. If you do not like the volume, I highly suggest you install this as it is compatible with Immersive Sounds instead of leaving comments about your ears being hurt. It will spare both you and I a headache.**

﻿Compatible with vanilla, [Audio Overhaul for Skyrim SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12466) and [Immersive Sounds - Compendium](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/523), Bulwark is a complete rework of shield bash and block sound effects with bassy, metallic slams to truly capture the raw strength of Skyrim's warriors and brigands. 
  
  
I made this mod as a request and as a result it is designed with ISC in mind, however I have included default filepaths in case you don't want to install ISC.

While the soundcloud previews above don't do the mod justice, the showcase in the Videos sectionfrom [Modslave](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/55856?tab=user+files) who both requested and helped me test Bulwark showcases the mod in practice.
  
**HIGHLY RECOMMENDED: [Dynamic Impacts by Goshbrindal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/140320) pairs PERFECTLY with my sound effects. Make sure to use the AOS-ISC version for my recommended setup.**
