A simple mod that integrates the Oblivion dungeon music added by the Anniversary Edition update into Beyond Skyrim: Bruma's caves and forts. Use this to add even more Oblivion nostalgia to your game!
  
  
As a bonus, the song "Last of the Guard" from Bruma (which only plays while inside Cloud Ruler Temple) is added into the normal rotation of exploration songs! The song, which is an arrangement of "Peace of Akatosh" from Oblivion, is an exploration track in said game, so I thought it'd make for a fun addition!

- This mod does NOT replace Beyond Skyrim's Cave/Fort music, it simply adds the Oblivion tracks to the existing Bruma Cave/Fort music lists.
  
  
- The Oblivion tracks were not added to the music setlists for Ayleid ruins, as I felt they clashed too much with Beyond Skyrim's original Ayleid music, and I wanted to respect the sinister mood they are setting for them.
  
  
- **This mod requires your game to be updated to at least The Anniversary Edition Patch (1.6 or later)**. However, **it does NOT require you to own the Anniversary Edition bundle or any Creation Club content at all**. The music files are built into the base game as a modder's resource.
