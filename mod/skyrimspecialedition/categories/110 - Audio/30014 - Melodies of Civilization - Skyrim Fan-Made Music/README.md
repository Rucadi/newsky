[b]I've also made [Dawnguard Music Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48613/), which expands on that DLC's soundtrack!**[/b]

**A compatibility patch for [Chapter II](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37792)﻿ is available in the Optional Files section.****Xbox/BethesdaNet version:**[non-replacer](https://bethesda.net/en/mods/skyrim/mod-detail/4240485) (includes all five of my music mods - port by Bass painter)/ replacer ([with](https://bethesda.net/en/mods/skyrim/mod-detail/4286537) or [without](https://bethesda.net/en/mods/skyrim/mod-detail/4286538) Dawnguard Music Overhaul - port by Clofas1)
  
[size=3]Part of the [The Phoenix Flavour](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14223) (Merged music plugin available [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48725?tab=description)﻿)[/size]
  
  
The mod adds new music to the cities and castles (think Dragonsreach) of Skyrim. These are not royalty free tracks packed together to make a quick mod. **These were written specifically for Skyrim and have its atmosphere, world and general vibe in mind**. This music is designed to fit with Skyrim and the original OST **as if it was always there**. As such, I made liberal use of melodies and motifs from other TES games, but arranged and orchestrated with the Skyrim style in mind. Of course, I also added a lot of my own melodic material.  **TL:DR no metal, electronic music, cheesy/cheap orchestral music, ect...**The mod adds:
  
- 4 city day tracks
  
- 2 city night tracks\*
  
- 2 palace/castle tracks
  
*\*It's worth noting that Skyrim does not have night music for cities, it instead reuses exploration music. The two tracks added by the mod however are exclusive to cities during the night.*
  
  
**The main mod adds the music without overriding vanilla music. The plugin is an esp flagged as esl and as such doesn't take a plugin slot.**The optional files also includes standalone replacer and a standalone ready to go package for [Personalized Music](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2572)﻿.

ABOUT ME
  
=============================**
  
  
I am a composer, and have been for about a decade now. I am also a huge fan of mods and video games, and love making music for those. You can hear some of my other work in [Summerset Isle](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68406/) by yourenotsupposedtobeinhere.
  
I have written the soundtrack for two video games: [Lost Past](https://captaincreepy.bandcamp.com/album/lost-past-soundtrack)﻿ and [20 000 lieues sans la mer](https://captaincreepy.bandcamp.com/album/20000-lieues-sans-la-mer)
  
You can hear some of my personal work on my [Bandcamp](https://captaincreepy.bandcamp.com/) (if you like what you've heard in my mods, my latest album [Nomad](https://captaincreepy.bandcamp.com/album/nomad)﻿ has similar music with a wider sound palette).
