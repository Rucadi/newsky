**You MAY NOT use my mods in paywalled modlists. Already I've seen some 'modlist authors' doing this and I strictly do not condone this. Modlists and load orders should not be hidden behind patreon subscriptions.
  
  
  
[Audio Overhaul for Skyrim SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12466) contains VOLUME SLIDERS for magic, weapons and other categories. If you do not like the volume, I highly suggest you install this as it is compatible with Immersive Sounds instead of leaving comments about your ears being hurt. It will spare both you and I a headache.****Sonorum Arcana** is a compilation of all my existing magic sounds in one easy, simple download. The following mods are included:

**Please note these mods may not receive updates in the future should I ever come back to edit my magic sounds.**
  
  
*Disclaimer: Sanguinum (Vampire Magic SFX) is currently not included as it uses a .esp plugin, and Sonorum Arcana currently does not require one.* 
  
  
**Planned Features:**
  

  
* .esp plugin with sliders for each individual magic school
Sanguinum integration
  
* Addons for popular magic mods such as Mysticism and the magic mods made by Darenii and Kittytail (upon approved permissions)
Reworked editions of individual schools
  
* FOMOD for modular installation including addons
