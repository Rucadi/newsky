[Audio Overhaul for Skyrim SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12466) contains VOLUME SLIDERS for magic, weapons and other categories. If you do not like the volume, I highly suggest you install this as it is compatible with Immersive Sounds instead of leaving comments about your ears being hurt. It will spare both you and I a headache.**

Pinewood Tone adds a nearly seven minute-long track of ambience featuring the rustling of leaves, creaking trees, forest critters and more to the existing ambience of your game while in certain regions. It will play in the forests near Falkreath and Riften, in addition to in those cities themselves, with a **0.5 chance, meaning it will not always play.** It is intended to meld perfectly with your existing ambience tracks, so in order for you to get a feeling for what it really sounds like, here's the full track below:
