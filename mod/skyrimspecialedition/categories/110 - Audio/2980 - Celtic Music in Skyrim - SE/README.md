**Celtic Music in Skyrim** provides 5 hours of new music (a total of 79 tracks) for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. 300 minutes for exploring, towns and optional dungeons and combat. The Mod just adds music and it does not delete or replace the vanilla music.
  
   
**Additional information about the Special Edition:** The current (and latest) version you can download here for SE is v2.1 of Celtic Music In Skyrim and its latest combat and dungeon versions. Earlier versions are just available for the vanilla Skyrim game. I've just converted the latest versions for the Special Edition.
  
   
For those who only want the Celtic Music playing without the vanilla tracks I recommend this mod: [Kill The Orchestra SE](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/303/?). Kill The Orchestra SE completely removes the vanilla music or specific tracks which you don't want ingame.

> MUSIC USAGE CONDITIONS:
>   
> Everyone is free to use my music if credits are given. Exceptions are if you want to use my music in something with commercial purpose because you can get into trouble with GEMA if there is no written permission from me, it already happened several times and people even got sued by GEMA without even my knowledge. So that's why you MUST request a written permission from me if your project is commercial, for your own safety. But as far as YouTube goes you can use my music for free even if you monetize your videos, just give credits and you can use any song you want. =)
