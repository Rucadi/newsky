[font=Georgia]**LIGHT**
  
Weather types need a **higher wind speed** to trigger sounds. Depending on your weather mod, this may result in sounds playing in *fewer* weather types. For most weather mods, distant thunder sounds will typically play in **stormy weathers** only.

[font=Georgia]**Distant Rolling Thunder** adds subtle, rolling thunder sounds to the atmosphere and is meant to complement your weather mod of choice. It is **not** meant to replace any thunder sounds as it does not touch any vanilla records or files.

Some weather mods add many new weather variants and not all weather mods are consistent with wind speeds. **Your mileage will vary!**

Some weather mods contain new thunder sounds, including distant rolling thunders to specific weather types, typically storms. The storm sounds found in this mod have been given a **lower priority** than most so that your main weather mod will take control, while this will still subtly play in the background.

**100% compatible with everything.**
  
Your weather mod of choice will determine how often sounds are heard.
