**LATEST CHANGES**

[/font][line][font=Tahoma]July 10th, 2021: Main File (v1.3) 
  
 - Combined all three ESPFE's into a single ESPFE "AIO" mod (All In One).
  
 - Now you have the option of having the AIO version, or three instruments individually (all ESPFE's, so no impact to your load order).
  
 - Updated the FOMOD.
  
  
[font=Tahoma]April 14th, 2021: Main File (v1.2) 
  
 - Switched from WAV (1411 kbps) files to XWM (192kbps) files (WAY SMALLER!!). Many thanks to [jn64](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/111923278) and [modluv](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/1619828) for the suggestion!! This is a great compression format, with a miniscule loss of quality!
  
 - Fixed the mus\_bardlute\_01\_05 song to the correct reference. It was a duplicate of mus\_bardlute\_01\_04 song previously. Thank you [jn64](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/111923278) for finding this!
  
[/font]
  
[font=Tahoma][size=3]March 28th, 2021: Main File (v1.1)

**MOD DETAILS**

[/font][line][font=Tahoma]
  
So, I had downloaded a couple mods that replaced the bard lute songs and drum songs:
  
  
[Alternative Bards Lute Songs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/795) by Jokerine
  
[Alternative Bards Drum Songs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/797)by Jokerine
  
[Bards Lute Songs by Trond Bengtson and David van Ooijen SE CONV](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44537) by holsbyHGC 
  
  
...but I wanted something more. I wanted to keep the original songs, and then have new songs too. 
  
  
A little bit of research in the CK revealed that certain spells have multiple sound effects upon impact or explosion. Using this philosophy, I attempted to place multiple song files into the same triggered Sound Descriptor, and WHA-LAH! Randomized songs!
  
  
But I couldn't just stop there. I had a rabbit hole to go down, demmit!
  
  
I went out in search of drum, flute, and lute songs that would offer a great variety of music when in taverns. I found the songs, recorded them, converted them to WAV files, edited them to the proper length to match the existing formats, and then made a list of all the replacements. DONE-ZO!
  
  
**For DRUMS, there are three (3) sets of base songs (they all run about 36 seconds). I've added six (6) new songs to each set, and also extracted and placed the three (3) new ones made by Jokerine ([Alternative Bards Drum Songs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/797)), for a total of eight (8) random possibilities for each version (24 total)! 
  
  
For FLUTES, there are six (6) sets of base songs (each with various runtimes). I've added an additional five (5) songs to each set, for a total of six (6) random songs for each set (36 total).
  
  
For LUTES, there are four (4) base songs (each with various runtimes). I've added seven (7) new songs to each set, along with the four (4) from Jokerine ([Alternative Bards Lute Songs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/795)), and the four (4) from holsbyHGC ([Bards Lute Songs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44537)), for a total of ten (10) random possibilities for each version (40 total)!**
  
  
For the best effect, I suggest using this along side the [Bard Instrumentals Mostly - Sing Rarely](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10927)mod.
  
  
Here is a list of all the songs that were added. I used a simple naming format for the mod itself, but here are the artists and which song (or rather which PORTION of the song) was used.
  
  
**Please see all associated music links at the bottom under credits. There are several artists here and they all have fascinating musical talent! Please visit their sites and support them if possible.**

**VIDEOS**

[/font][line][font=Tahoma]
  
Here are some videos that highlight this mod.
  
  
This first one is from Bards College Graduate, who featured this in one of her mod reviews on tavern overhauls. My mod is located at timestamp 9:14.
  
  
  
  
Here is a video to show some of the songs. I've edited it to skip all flute (this was made prior to me adding them), singing, and the weird glitch that makes the Bard keep playing long after the song is over (not sure what's up with that). This should give you an idea on how this mod works. 
  
  
  
  
And here is another one with the Flutes included... along with colorful commentary from everyone's favorite tavern resident, EMBRY!
  
  
Don't miss out on his hilarious one-liners like "What are you staring at (while he stares at you from the distance)", the classic side-splitter, "Need something?", or the deeply inquisitive, "Yes?".  Oh, my funny bone hurts...!
  
  
Also included are Embry's magical teleportation abilities, caught live on tape! No stationary chair or dusty tavern mist can stop him!
