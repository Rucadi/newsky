Playing without Music increases immersion a lot, but Skyrim's OST is just too beautiful to remove it entirely from the game. Maybe you like to play with music in Taverns and Towns or while exploring, but dislike combat or Dungeon music? This mod lets you choose to your liking, wether to keep or skip a triggered music type, by simply replacing the vanilla music files with empty sound files. By default, all boxes in the FOMOD are selected (no music at all), so just untick what you want to keep.
