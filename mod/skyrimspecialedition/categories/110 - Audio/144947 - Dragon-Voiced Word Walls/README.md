Powered by [Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805)﻿, **Dragon-Voiced Word Walls** replaces the vanilla "glow" loop sound markers at each location. As a result, the spoken dialogue will cease once the associated word is learned (just like in vanilla Skyrim).
  
  
Every Word Wall has 3 glow loops that are triggered when you approach. The sound markers are tied to X-markers which indicate which word to highlight and learn next as multiple words can be learned at the same location. 
  
  
The dialogue spoken will also be associated with the next word to learn as I took the time to ensure each specific word's dialogue matched the correct sound marker.[/font]

[font=Georgia]**To clarify,** you can learn all words for Animal Allegiance (Raan, Mir, Tah) at Angarvunde, Ancient's Ascent, and Ysgramor's Tomb. If you visit Angarvunde first, you'll learn and hear Raan. If you visit Ancient's Ascent next, you'll learn and hear Mir. The dialogue will mirror the next word to learn no matter which location you learn it.[/font]

[font=Georgia]The Dialogue spoken will match the etched words on each wall depending on which word you are learning next. To find both the Dragon Tongue and English Translations for each word, visit [The Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Word_Wall).

[font=Georgia]**Dragon-Voiced Word Walls** uses [Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805)﻿ to replace all glow loop sound markers. It is compatible with all vanilla edits to Word Walls or the areas surrounding them. It should be compatible with mods that *move* word walls, as long as those mods also moved the sound markers associated with them.
  
  
The only conflicts will come from any mods that replace the following [/font][font=Georgia]4[/font][font=Georgia] audio files (if you choose them in the FOMOD):
  
music>special>mus\_special\_wordofpower\_01.xwm
  
music>special>mus\_special\_wordofpower\_02.xwm
  
music>special>mus\_special\_wordofpower\_03.xwm
  
sound>fx>qst>qst\_wordwall\_whisper\_2d\_lp
  
  
Whichever mod you have lower in your LO will overwrite the other safely.

[font=Georgia]﻿[Lorkhan Soundtrack Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/115096)﻿ - Lorkhan includes not only the music files but also replaces the whisper loop at word walls. I personally prefer Lorkhan's music choices for learning Word Walls, and my included whisper loop. Whichever you load below will win. (Video showcase in description will show a comparison)
