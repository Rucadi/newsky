Hircine's voice sounded better in Oblivion and in Skyrim he was very similar to Peryite. I wanted him to sound more like his predecessor and Markalanvoices readily revoiced this characer. He now sounds more intimidating and primal.

Zero requirements. This mod is simple loose audio files in .fuz format. Ensure it loads after any other mods that may alter these. No ESP, safe to add or remove at any time.
