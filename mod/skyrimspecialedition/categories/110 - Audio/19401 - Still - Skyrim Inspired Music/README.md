DESCRIPTION
  
=============================
  
  
Still is fully compatible and intended to be used with [Hun Lovaas](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16123)﻿, [Melodies of Civilization](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30014)﻿ and [Around the Fire](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36144/)﻿.
  
[b]I've also made [Dawnguard Music Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48613/), which expands on that DLC's soundtrack!**
  
[/b]A compatibility patch for [Chapter II](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37792)﻿ is available in the Optional Files section.
  
[size=3]Part of the [The Phoenix Flavour](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14223) (Merged music plugin available [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48725?tab=description)﻿)[/size]
  
  
The mod adds new exploration and dungeon music to the game. These are not random royalty-free tracks packed together to make a quick mod, and while they were not specifically written for Skyrim (see bottom of the description for details) **they are heavily inspired by the original tracks and Jeremy Soule's work in general**. So the music here fits in very well with the original tracks and in the game in general.
  
**TL:DR, no EDM, metal, trance or overly cheesy/cheap orchestral tracks, ect...****The esp version does not override any vanilla music.**
  
  
The mod adds:
  
- 20 minutes of day exploration music
  
- 12 minutes of night/dusk exploration music
  
- 6 minutes of dungeon music 
  
  
  
You can take a listen here. **The nature sounds in the video are not included in the mod's tracks!** (See bottom of the description for details)

Still is not compatible with mods that edits the same playlists (or music types) as it does, which are the exploration and dungeon playlists. Mods that edit other playlists (combat, towns, inns, ect...) are compatible. **If you have a doubt about compatibility, use SSEEdit to look for conflicts.**

**\*Notes for ESL version\***
  
  
ESL are a relatively new plugin format added to Fallout 4 and SSE. You can learn more about them [here](https://afkmods.iguanadons.net/index.php?/topic/5079-plugin-files-and-you-esmeslesp/)﻿. They have advantages and disadvantages which I will list here. The best reason to use esl files is that they don't count towards the maximum plugin limit, which is very useful for people that have crowded (200+ plugins) load orders. The problem with them is that they always lose conflicts with esp files. In the case of this mod, that means that if you use the esl version and have any other plugins that touches exploration and dungeon music types, you will not hear the new music. **This is why I recommend only advanced users and users already familiar with ESL files use the ESL version.**

STORY TIME 
  
=============================**
  
  
So, Still wasn't originally meant to be music for Skyrim. It's an ambient music album that I wrote, exploring ambient orchestral music and focused on musical and natural textures hence the nature sounds in the preview video. The album was obviously very heavily inspired by the Skyrim OST and even more by Jeremy Soule's Northerner Diaries.
  
Ultimately, the tracks fit very well with the Skyrim OST, which is why I decided to create this mod.
