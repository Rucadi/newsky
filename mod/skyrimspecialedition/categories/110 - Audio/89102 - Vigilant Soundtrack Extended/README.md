[﻿﻿Vigilant](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11849?tab=description)﻿ remains one of my favourite quest mods of all time, but it always bugged me how in some boss fights I could always hear the music stop as it reached the end of its track, followed by a couple seconds of silence and then start again, especially fights which were somewhat longer. It bugged me enough to go and edit some of the shorter tracks to try to make them loop better.
  
  
Not every track has been edited, such as the ending themes since they only play the once, but rather the shorter tracks like boss themes have been edited and made longer. On average most 1~ minute tracks are now around the 3~ minute mark with some exceptions. A couple of good examples are the "Requiem" and "Tower" tracks which you hear often towards the end but they are only 1 minute long so hearing the music stop and start was quite frequent, both of these tracks are now over 3:30. One of the worst offenders was Deathbringer Volar's theme at only 53 seconds!
  
  
Some loops are more seamless than others, but ideally you won't notice them happen ingame. I had a few [cases of this happen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNtsRwaVBs4) but overall I feel quite happy with the result, though I may come back to revisit some tracks I'm not 100% satisfied with in the future.
  
  
I've also included an optional file which includes three tracks (Tower, Requiem and Molag Bal) that I had a little fun with and got a bit creative and goes a little beyond simply creating a loop. I tried to create a more "finale" feel with rising action as their respective scenes go on. This is referred to as "Redux" in optional files, simply overwrite the main file if desired.
