**Requires** [**Base Object Swapper﻿**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805)![](https://i.imgur.com/bVvY2fu.png)﻿[/font]

[font=Georgia]Adds looping audio whispers to 9 Daedric Shrines. V1.2 adds 7 more Daedric Princes made to use with [Daedric Shrines - All In One](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78772)﻿.
  
 
  
FOMOD included gives the option to silence each shrine's whispers after completing their respective quests.
  
  
Volume slider available in the Audio Settings menu.

All whispering sound effects were voiced by me and [RhaellaStark](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/RhaellaStark/mods?gameId=1704)﻿ and then edited to be eerie. No outside assets or AI voices were used.
  
  
The whispering audio is added to sound markers and hand-placed near Daedric Shrines.
  
[Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805)﻿ is used for 4 interior locations for maximum compatibility. I swapped out some tankards and apples for sound markers in these locations.
  
  
Whispers of the Daedric Princes V1.2
  
[Daedric Shrines - All In One](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78772)﻿ is required for all whispers to be present

Sound effects were added to 9 Daedric Shrine locations. The audio is intentionally difficult to understand, but each loop contains lore-friendly phrases. If you listen closely enough, you can make out some of what they're saying.
