> "﻿The Empire stretches across Tamriel, the largest known continent of the World. To the north of Tamriel is Atmora, from whence the Men of the World came. To the west is Yokuda, the lost native land of the Redguards. To the east is Akavir, whose armies invaded Tamriel in the previous era. To the south all is mystery and the whisper of a lost Elven homeland."

Lost Races of Nirn adds five brand new playable races to the game: the [Ayleid](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Ayleid), the [Dwemer](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Dwemer), the [Maormer](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Sea_Elf), the [Snow Elf](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Snow_Elf), and the [Tsaesci](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Tsaesci_(race)). All these races are derived from lore but most have narrative issues regarding their presence in Skyrim. It is up to you to design a roleplay to explain how or why your character is here!
  
  
This mod is packaged with a FOMOD installer in order to pick which races you want to install. Support for [Aetherius](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26686), [Scion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41639), and [Racial Abilities - Greater Power Replacement](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/108759) is also provided in the installer.

**Recommended Mods**
  
  
This mod was designed with vanilla Skyrim's quality and aestethic in mind. If you use body texture mods, I recommend installing [Lost Races of Nirn - Female Skin Textures (Snow Elves - Maormer)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90443) by [albinowalrus64](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/13564540) for consistency purposes. I use it myself alongside [Tempered](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7902)[Skins](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8505), [Tempered Racial Textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54573), [Forgotten Argonian Roots](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1704), [Coverkhajiits](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/5941)﻿, and [Fur Textures for CoverKhajiits](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76568).

Race mods have a few inherent limitations that users should be aware of. A few times in vanilla the game checks for the Player's race to return a specific line of dialogue (ex. Hadvar telling you where your remains will be sent), since the game wasn't developed with new races in mind the game won't be able to respond correctly to your race. [Race Compatibility](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/122592) improves this slightly by allowing the designation of a vanilla proxy race that your modded race will be viewed as.
  
  
The following vanilla races serve as proxies for these modded races:
  
  
Ayleid = High Elf
  
Dwarf = Wood Elf
  
Sea Elf = Wood Elf
  
Snow Elf = High Elf
  
Tsaesci = Imperial
  
  
Race Compatibility also does several other helpful things such as editing a few vanilla scripts to prevent custom races from breaking things like Werewolf and Vampire Lord transformations.
