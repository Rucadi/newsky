*The most up to date, bug fixed and seamless working version of **[Racial Body Morphs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20684)**, with fixes by **FK - fairkauri**, author of [FK's diverse racial skeletons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38563?tab=description), updated for Skyrim Anniversary Edition! (I mean, nothing really needed to be done as far as I could tell, but it sure sounds more exciting.)*
  
  
  
**Mod summary:** 
  
This mod diversifies the height, weight and body morphs of all the races and genders of Skyrim. Each race has morphs that have been tweaked and perfected since the mod's conception in 2014, taking into account their heights/weights in previous games, their stats, skills, abilities, general roles and overall aesthetics and lore. 
  
The main point of this mod is identifying character races at a glance, especially those nearly identical men and mer like Imperials/bretons and Dunmer/bosmer females.
  
  
*Orcs are hulking and brutish, High elves tower above the other races, Nords are bulky barbarians, and wood elves are as short as they were in previous installments, beast races are much more wiry with unique postures and proportions that are less generic and humanoid.*
  
  
  
Wait, isn't this just **Racial Body Morphs**1.1 rereleased with AE slapped on it Todd Howard style?

As opposed to being Racial Body Morphs this is more a marriage between [FK's Diverse Racial Skeletons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38563?tab=description) and Racial Body Morphs, a joint project as suggested by fairkauri, making it easier to base fixes between the respective mods. 
  
  
The main differences are:
  

  
* Rebuilt from scratch using [XPMSSE v4.72](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1988)﻿, which hopefully means that *it just works™* with all the latest body & physics mods
Comprehensive documentation for mod makers (see included .xlsx files)
  
* Racial types share the same base skeleton, which *maybe*makes it more compatible out-of-the box with [Nemesis](https://github.com/ShikyoKira/Project-New-Reign---Nemesis-Main/releases)﻿[list]
beast races were modified using an edited skeletonBeast.nif
  
* non-beast races were modified using an edited skeleton.nif

  
[\*]The collision bug that breaks FUS RO DAH and other knockdown attacks has been fixed
  
[\*]IMO, skeleton edits are more consistent

  
* skeletons are now symmetrical
Altmer men are now taller than Altmer women
  
* removed edits to female khajiit and argonian finger bones

  
[\*]Dawnguard & USSEP records are forwarded, eliminating the vampire facial bugs
  
[\*]Racial names have been changed for maximum *I M M E R S I O N*
