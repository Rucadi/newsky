[font=Comic Sans MS]**[color=#d5a6bd]do not ask the XPMSSE folks for help. also read the install notes.**[/color][/font]
  
Based off of the now outdated [Racial Body Morphs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20684)﻿.
  
  
For the updated **Racial Body Morphs** which incorporates the fixes from this mod, check out:
  
 [Racial Body Morphs Redux by FK and OnHolyServiceBound](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65047) 
  

  
* The main difference between this mod and RBM redux is the scaling
while this mod is true to the classic scaling found in Morrowind, RBM redux has a more complicated scaling based off of combined ES lore.
  
* The scaling is also more subtle in this mod compared to RBM due to using Morrowind's scaling, which may lower instances of clipping

*The other difference is that this mod is more routinely updated as FK actually knows what he's doing -*OnHolyServiceBound
  
  
  
The differences compared to the now outdated legacy version of [Racial Body Morphs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20684)﻿ are/were:
  

  
* Rebuilt from scratch using [XPMSSE v4.80](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1988)﻿, which hopefully means that *it just works™* with all the latest body & physics mods
Female skeletons will *eventually* be based off [Vera's Female Skeleton](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59284)
  
* Comprehensive documentation for mod makers (see included .xlsx files)
*it just works™* with VR mods like [VRIK](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23416)﻿ and [HIGGS](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43930)﻿
  
* Racial types share the same base skeleton, which *maybe* makes it more compatible out-of-the box with [Nemesis](https://github.com/ShikyoKira/Project-New-Reign---Nemesis-Main/releases)﻿
    
  [list]
beast races were modified using an edited skeletonBeast.nif
  
* non-beast races were modified using an edited skeleton.nif

[\*]The collision bug that breaks FUS RO DAH and other knockdown attacks has been fixed (don't parent NPC COM [COM])
  
[\*]IMO, skeleton edits are more consistent
  

  
* skeletons are now symmetrical
Altmer men are now taller than Altmer women
  
* removed hand edits

[\*]Dawnguard & USSEP records are forwarded, eliminating the vampire facial bugs
  
[\*]OOTB-compatible with [Simple Dual Sheath](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50049)
  
[\*]Racial heights are now based off of Morrowind's lore

Installation:
  

  
* Install via MO2. I don't use Vortex or NMM, so I won't be able to help with those.
I would very-strongly recommend [FHSFE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32010) and [FPCHF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28091)﻿, but I guess they're technically optional.
  
* If you use high heels, try [Heels Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64442)﻿
You should probably use [Mu Joint Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57939)﻿ as well if you do any poses
  
* Run Nemesis - you can use FNIS, but like... why?﻿

  
  
  
FAQ:
  

  
* Will you please make a patch for [insert mod name]?
    
  [list]
Probably, unless it involves skeleton edits. Then no. Do it yourself.
