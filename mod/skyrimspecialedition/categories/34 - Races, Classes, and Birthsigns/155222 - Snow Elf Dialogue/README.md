# Snow Elf Dialogue
- Author: Alesandren
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/155222


This mod adds immersive, lore-friendly, race-aware dialogue from NPCs throughout the game that recognize you are playing as an ancient Falmer/snow elf character. Every line is fully-voiced across all relevant questlines, like Helgen, the Thieves Guild, the Dark Brotherhood, and the Dawnguard DLC. The mod includes both new custom dialogue and expanded use of existing elf-related lines from the base game. See the video for a demo.
  
  
My design philosophy is total immersion: that playing as a snow elf feels like a natural, almost vanilla part of the game. The dialogue reflects the fact that snow elves are considered extinct, with most NPCs reacting with confusion, disbelief, or curiosity. Dialogue has been carefully crafted to respect any backstory you choose for how and why your character is in Skyrim, without requiring a specific explanation. For example, the dialogue recognizes that your character may or may not know the Falmer language (relevant to the Thieves Guild and Dawnguard), but never forces you to decide.
  
  
This is my first mod of this scale, so I would appreciate as much feedback as possible. I plan to add more dialogue if there are other characters or scenes where it would make sense. Please let me know if you encounter any bugs so I can try to fix them.
  
  
Safe to install mid-playthrough, but not during a quest with custom dialogue.
  
  
I have authorized C1056 to port to console.
