> [font=serif]*Of all the et'Ada who wandered Nirn, Trinimac was the strongest. He, for a very long time, fooled the Aldmeri into thinking that tears were the best response to the Sundering. They cried and shamed our ancestors, especially the feminine Altmer. They even took the Missing God's name in vain, calling His narratives into question. So one day Boethiah, Prince of Plots, precocious youth, tricked Trinimac to go into his mouth. Boethiah talked like Trinimac for awhile then, and gathered enough people to listen to him. Boethiah showed them the lies of the et'Ada, the Aedra, and told them Trinimac was the biggest liar of all, saying all this with Trinimac's voice! Boethiah told the mass before him the Tri-Angled Truth. He showed them, with Mephala, the rules of Psijic Endeavor. He taught them how to build Houses, and what items they needed to bury in the Corners. He demonstrated the right way to wear their skin. He performed the way to walk to achieve an Exodus. Then Boethiah relieved himself of Trinimac right there on the ground before them to prove all the things he said were the truth. It was easy then for his new people to become the Changed Ones.*[/font]

Introduction:
  
  
This mod adds a new playable race: namely the Chimer or Velothi - known as the ancestors of the Dunmer. Surprisingly there aren't any mods on Nexus for Special Edition that add the Chimer as a playable race despite their intriguing and esoteric lore. So I decided to make one myself.
  
  
  
  
  
Description:
  
  
Once Aldmeri followers of the prophet Veloth, they became the Chimer and settled on the eastern land of Dwemereth or Resdayn, now known as Morrowind. In stark contrast to the Dwemer the Chimer were highly religious and revered the Three Good Daedra: Mephala, Azura and Boethiah. Despite their combined victory over Nordic invaders, they maintained a somewhat uneasy relationship with the Dwemer which eventually resulted in the War of the First Council and culminated in the Battle of Red Mountain, which was decided with the sudden disappearence of the Dwemer. 
  
  
The Tribunal's - Vivec, Almalexia and Sotha Sil - betrayal and lust for divine power angered Azura who shortly after their ascension to godhood cursed the Chimer with ash grey skin and fiery red eyes. Thus the age of the Chimer ended and the age of the Dunmer began.
  
  
  
  
Features:
  
  
While this mod is 100% functional, this is very much a work in progress, since this is my very first mod that isn't a patch or small modification. The Chimer race is based on the Dunmer morphs and thanks to RaceCompatibility has the DunmerProxy keyword, thus instances where the LDB's race is taken into account (i.e. Dark Brotherhood questline, Helgen) work as intended. Dawnguard Lycantrophy and Vampirism work fine as well.
  
  
The race does not have any custom textures yet. It will use the textures and body you have installed. This means it will blend seamlessly into your game, no matter if you are using appearance mods or are playing vanilla.
  
  
The Chimer race has one passive ability, two Lesser Powers and one Daily Power which are all uniquely powerful and have utilities in their own regard.
  
  
  
  
Powers:
  
  
Volcanic Blood -> *Living in the land of Resdayn has steeled you against blazing heat. Your Chimer blood gives you 75% resistance to fire. (Passive)*Mephala's Deception -> *Mephala grants you the power of deception. For 60 seconds you become invisible, completely silent and all enemies around you become frenzied. (Lesser Power. Base cost: 900 magicka)*Boethiah's Ambition -> *Invoke Boethiah's blessing. For 10 seconds you briefly gain inhuman strength, defenses and reflexes, and become cloaked in poisonous mist. (Lesser Power. Base cost: 1000 magicka)*Azura's Fortitude -> *Once per day Azura blesses you. For 20 seconds Health, Magicka and Stamina regenerate rapidly. (Daily Power)*
  
  
Compatibility:
  
  
**Vampire overhauls:**
  
Requires a patch if the mod modifies the vampire race. Patches for Sacrosanct and Sacrilege are provided in the Optional Files section. Better Vampires works with custom races out of the box. For correct installation and issues please consult the Better Vampires and RaceCompatibility main pages.
  
  
**High Poly Head:**Compatible. Patch provided in the Optional Files section.
  
  
**Body/Face texture mods:**Compatible. Will use your own installed textures.
  
  
**CotR, UBE:**Incompatible. Requires a patch.
  
  
**Wintersun:**Requires [Wintersun - Custom Race Support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24745)**Werewolf overhauls:﻿**Mostly compatible. Tested with Growl and Moonlight Tales. Both work with custom races.
  
  
You are *absolutely* allowed to create your own patches! If you publish them however I'd like you to notify me so I can update the compatibility list accordingly.
  
  
  
  
Installation instructions:
  
  
Load after any mods requiring a patch and load the patches after this mod. Example load order:
  
  
 ﻿- Sacrosanct
  
 ﻿- Sacrosanct addons and patches
  
 ﻿- The Changed Ones - Chimer Race
  
 ﻿- The Changed Ones - Sacrosanct Patch
  
  
This is to ensure everything works as it should. Other than that installation order does not matter. Sort your plugins with LOOT.
  
  
  
  
Future Plans:
  
  
- custom eye textures
  
- custom warpaints
  
- custom skin textures
  
- custom armor and weapons
  
- more spells and skills
