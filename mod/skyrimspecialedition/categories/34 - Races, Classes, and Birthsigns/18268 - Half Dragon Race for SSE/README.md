**[Known Issue]**
  
Rank system and feeding may not work correctly when using Better vampires together.
  
- The workaround is listed in [compatible] below.
  
(Generally, perfectly compatibility of custom race and vampire design is difficult problem. Since it is the specification of base game, all is unavoidable.)

- This race is NOT compatible with mods that edit to the record of PlayerRace (ex: a mod separates player from NPCs).
  
  Check for conflicts if your character has not scales, horns, or tail.

2. From MCM menu of Better Vampires select "Reset Sanguinare Vampiris".

\* If you are already playing the game and you are a vampire, use "Fix Feeding For Custom Race" or clean install of Better Vampires may be necessary.
  
Reference : [here](https://sites.google.com/site/bettervampires/faq/using-a-custom-race)
  
  
\*\* It seems that it will not work if you become a vampire in other ways.

If you want to become a vampire in other ways, you need perform once the above steps beforehand.
  
  
  
**[FAQ]**Q. This mod always makes game crash in title :(
  
A. Please correctly install requirements.
  
  
Q. Why don't you release naked version?
  
A. I have already received very very much requests for it, but I never release it because it is against my policy as auther. 
  
    Instead, you may use this mod together with body mod you like (including naked).
  
    You can remove underwear easily by installing this mod and any naked body mod,
  
    even if have no knowledge of mod structures or editing meshes.
  
  
Q. My character has not wings! This mod is broken!
  
A. This mod not included wings. Please install Animated Dragon Wings.
  
  
Q. My character has no horns, and has a skin without scales from the neck up...
  
A. If you are using Racemenu, you can go to "Face Part" slider and switch the head mesh to the one in this race.
  
  
Q. The body skin of my character looks like a generally human. Where is scales?
  
A. It is probably caused by conflict with a mod that edits the record of player, you will need to find out the cause and solve by yourself.
  
   If you using mod that apply specific textures / meshes to player only such as "Isharas Custom Player Body", "Unique Character - Player Races", or "Unique Player Werewolves" try to uninstall it once.
  
  
  By the way, if you want to make the player's body different from the NPC, you can do this by installing Independent Body version and manually replacing body meshes.
  
  
Q. Despite being not a vampire, some sliders do not working in Character creation.
  
A. Please try the below method:
  
   - Please Update to latest version.
  
   - Please confirm that RaceCompatilibity.esm is enabled. 
  
   - Please adjust load order. 
  
   - Please move the Sex slider or the Preset slider on trial. Then please try to move other sliders.

    Horn : DragonboneHelmHornsF.nif, DragonboneHelmHornsM.nif
  
    Tail : femaletailargonian.nif, maletailargonian.nif
  
  
Q. I want to replace vanilla race (e.g nord, imperial etc.) with this race. Is there any way you could?
  
A. I'm afraid but it takes labor much, so I have no plans to create it, so I have no plans to create it.
  
  
Q. Xbox One / PS4 version PLZ!!!!!!
  
A. There is no release plan.
  
  
Q. Why need so many mods to reproduce Screenshots? I should you'll create All-in-one package.
  
A. I place great importance on the extensibility at character creation because I love to create character with various customizes with various mods.
  
    There are many many wonderful mods on mods community, so please enjoy original customization on your game.
  
    My screenshots an example.
  
  
Q. After updating this mod, my character's eyes and teeth only were floating in the air...
