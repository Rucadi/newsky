Daedra Seducers Redux is a succubus-style player race. Daedra Seducers were introduced to the Elder Scrolls universe in Daggerfall. They are also known as The Mazken or Dark Seducers. This mod attempts to incorporate those lore elements as much as possible. However, since everyone's gameplay style is different, many features of Daedra Seducers Redux are customizable in both the FOMOD and the MCM, especially since even Bethesda hasn't kept that lore consistent.
  
  
**Why another succubus race?**
  
I have been playing Skyrim for many years. When I decided to try playing a succubus-style race, most at the time did not meet my desired play style. It was then that I stumbled upon Nikitaa's mod, [Daedra Seducers](https://etherealmod.wordpress.com/2018/08/06/succubus-race-sse/). At the time, I really liked the concept of it. However, Daedra Seducers has some bugs, and was not getting updated or fixed. After speaking with Nikitaa, I created a number of patches for that original mod, [Daedra Seducers (Succubus Race) - Official Patch Hub.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/100404) I also began work on a new, updated version. However, as it is with these things, I wanted more creative control than Nikitaa was willing to give. Please, let me be clear. There is no ill will between myself and Nikitaa. These things just happen. As a result, I decided to make my own version. While Daedra Seducers Redux is inspired by Nikitaa's original mod, it contains no assets from that mod. All scripts have been written by myself. Any other assets, like the tails, claws, skin, etc. are used with the various mod authors' permissions. I had been wanting to stretch my modding and Papyrus skills, so Daedra Seducers Redux was born. 
  
  
**Features**
  
**Dual Form:** The Daedra Seducer race has two forms, a human form, and her daedric form. When making your character in the RaceMenu, there will be a new “Daedra Seducer” tab. The first slider, “Daedra Form”, will toggle the character between the two forms (0 = human, 1 = daedra). You can create completely different looks for each form (obviously, the first time you click the toggle, the forms will look the same). The horns, claws, and tail are only visible while in the daedra form. Please note, this mod will save two presets in a daedra-seducer folder inside your presets folder. It is important to not delete these files. For other options, including wing selection, see the MCM after character creation. The Daedra Seducer race includes a transformation spell to switch between a human and daedra form. Included in this transformation are:
  
  

  
* Wings, claws, horns, and tail are hidden in human form.
Claws, horns, and tails are selected in the RaceMenu.
  
* Wings are selected in the MCM.
Optional flying while wings are out.
  
* Human form is weaker. (optional via MCM)
Daedra form regenerates faster. (adjustable via MCM)
  
* Jump height increased when wings are out. (adjustable via MCM)
No fall damage when wings are out.
  
* Claws and wings can be toggled via a hot key. (configured via MCM)
Transformation can be toggled via a hot key. (configured via MCM)
  
* Each form can have very different appearances (hair, skin color, body weight, overlays, etc.). (edited via RaceMenu)
If using [OBody Next Generation](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77016), you can apply a different body preset to each form.

**Wings**
  
There are no wings built into Daedra Seducers Redux. The mod will detect and use whichever wing mod you have installed. Below are the currently supported wing mods. Note: Animated Wings Ultimate has to be installed before installing Daedra Seducers Redux so the FOMOD can see that it is available. If using Animated Wings Ultimate, use the Daedra Seducers MCM for the Daedra Seducer's wings. The Animated Wings MCM menu has no effect on the wings selected for the Daedra Seducer.

**[size=4][color=#00ff00]Flying Mod Integration**
  
[/size][/color]Note: I have simply allowed for using the fly mod. I will not and cannot address any bugs with flying itself. I plan on writing my own flying integration for Daedra Seducers Redux 2.0.
  
  
Flying is possible while the wings are out. A hotkey can be configured via the MCM to enable/disable flying mode. 
  
In order to have flying, you must have one of the following flying mods installed (each is an improvement on the other, as such they are requirements of each other).
  
[Flying Mod Beta](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13905?tab=files)﻿
  
[Flying Mod Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13905?tab=files)﻿ (also found on the same page as Flying Mod Beta)
  
[Flying Mod Rework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34571?tab=files)﻿ (found in the files section of Animated Wings Ultimate -- Animated Wings Ultimate is not needed for the Flying Mod.
  
  
**Requirements**
  

  
* High Poly Head (Not required, but highly recommended)
RaceMenu (obviously)
  
* FSMP - Faster HDT-SMP
RaceCompatibility
  
* FormList Manipulator - FLM
Keyword Item Distributor - KID
  
* powerofthree's Papyrus Extender
Open Animation Replacer (for claw fighting animations)
  
* Obody Next Generation (for different body presets for each form)
Flying Mod Beta by porroone and Flying Mod Overhaul by Indefiance (if flying integration is wanted)
  

  
  
**Vampire Mod Compatibility**
  
Note: While I do occasionally do a vampire playthrough, I don't play Daedra Seducers as vampires. However, I will test and attempt to address any issues reported.
  
Known Issues: No known issues with vanilla Skyrim vampires. Sacrosanct displays inconsistencies with hair styles when switching forms.
  

  
* **Better Vampires:** Better Vampires works with RaceCompatibility
**Sacrosanct:**Sacrosanct works with Race Compatibility and RC\_SacroSanct\_Patch\_By\_GroundAura\_For\_5\_17\_And\_6\_0
  

  
  
**High Poly Head**
  
If using High Poly Head, before designing your character, or applying a preset designed for another race, make sure to change the Face Part under the Head category in RaceMenu. Use HP\_DaedraSeducer\_Head.
