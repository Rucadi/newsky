**Mundus - A Standing Stone Overhaul**

  
Mundus is a complete overhaul of Skyrim’s Standing Stones designed to balance the game’s stone bonuses and add powerful new gameplay options. Greater Powers have been removed in favor of passive abilities that will define and support various builds. The more powerful stones often have downsides, in order to give players a choice between building around these downsides in exchange for powerful buffs, or avoiding these downsides in exchange for more modest buffs. Additionally, Guardian Stones no longer provide experience bonuses, which often encouraged players not to trade them out for more interesting gameplay bonuses. 
  
  
Mundus is designed to complement my mod [Aetherius - A Race Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26686), but it does not require it.

**The Apprentice Stone**

**Path of Wisdom:** Your Magicka is increased by 50, and your spells and enchantments cost 10% less.

**Cheater’s Luck:** Your Stamina is increased by 50, you move 10% faster, and you take 50% less damage from falling.
  
  
**The Tower Stone****Warden’s Wall:**Your Armor Rating is increased by 100, and you reflect 100% of incoming melee damage back at your attacker.  
  
  
**The Warrior Stone**
  
**Warborn:** Your Health is increased by 50, and you resist 10% of all incoming weapon and spell damage. 
  
**Notes**
  

  
* The Apprentice Stone modifies Base Magicka Regeneration, meaning that it makes all sources of Fortify Magicka Regeneration twice as strong.
The Lady Stone's bonuses to Health, Magicka, and Stamina Regeneration when below 50% Health, Magicka, or Stamina operate independently; falling below 50% Health increases your Health Regeneration, but not your Magicka and Stamina Regeneration, by 50%.
  
* The Lover Stone modifies Base Stamina Regeneration, meaning that it makes all sources of Fortify Stamina Regeneration twice as strong.
The Serpent Stone's bonus to Potion Duration stacks additively with other (non-perk) sources of Potion Duration in Simonrim, if Thaumaturgy is installed.
  
* The Shadow Stone's bonus to Sneak Attack Damage stacks additively with other (non-perk) sources of Sneak Attack Damage in Simonrim, if Thaumaturgy is installed.
The Tower Stone's Reflect Damage effect does not protect you from incoming damage. Additionally, Blade and Blunt's incoming and outgoing difficulty modifiers significantly reduce the effectiveness of Reflect Damage, which is why its potency is set to 100%.
  
* The Warrior Stone's bonus to Block stacks additively with other (non-perk) sources of Fortify Block in Simonrim, if Thaumaturgy is installed.

  
**Compatibility**
  
  
Mundus is lightweight and compatible, and will not interfere with any mod (except for other Standing Stone mods). It includes a copy of the PlayerSleepQuestScript, which is required to allow you to gain the Rested bonus with the Lover Stone. Relevant USSEP edits have been forwarded.
