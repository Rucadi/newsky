**Aetherius - A Race Overhaul**

  
Aetherius is a complete overhaul of Skyrim’s human, elf, and beast races designed to balance the game’s races and add powerful new gameplay options. Greater powers have been removed in favor of stronger, more desirable passives. Although each race has been designed to fill a specific role, the nature of these bonuses allow for a broad range of builds to benefit from them. In addition, all starting skills have been reduced, to place more emphasis on the player’s choice of race. 
  
  
Aetherius is designed to complement my mod [Mundus - A Standing Stone Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33411/?tab=description&BH=0), but it does not require it.

* Human and elf races start with 5 base unarmed damage.
Beast races (Argonians and Khajiit) start with 10 base unarmed damage.
  
* Human and elf races gain an addition 5 base unarmed damage when they become Werewolves, if Manbeast is installed.
The Argonian's bonus to Potion Duration stacks additively with other (non-perk) sources of Fortify Potion Duration in Simonrim, if Thaumaturgy is installed.
  
* The Imperial's bonus to buying and selling prices stacks additively with other (non-perk) sources of Fortify Barter, if Thaumaturgy is installed.
The Khajiit's 50% reduction to Stamina costs while sprinting extends to Stamina costs while sneaking, if Blade & Blunt 3.0 is installed. If Blade & Blunt is loaded after Aetherius, the tooltip will be updated to reflect this change, as well.
  
* The Wood Elf's bonus to Sneak Attack Damage stacks additively with other (non-perk) sources of Fortify Sneak Attack Damage in Simonrim, if Thaumaturgy is installed.
If Hand to Hand is installed, races with a major or minor skill in Lockpicking will have a major or minor skill in Hand to Hand.

**Aetherius - NPC Spell Absorption Addon**
  
  
By default, NPC Bretons do not benefit from Spell Absorption. This is because many mods add abilities that distribute incorrectly made cloak spells, which causes Breton NPCs to appear to absorb these spells, causing them to "glow blue." Users will then blame Aetherius for this problem, which forces me to remove Spell Absorption from NPCs. However, Spell Absorption is a pretty cool stat, and I don't want to avoid using it just because other mods are made badly, so this addon re-adds Spell Absorption to Breton NPCs. It may require a new game to work properly, but there will be no harm in installing it mid-playthrough.
  
  
If you experience Breton NPCs glowing blue after downloading this addon, **do not** report it as a bug. The problem is with other mods and their incorrectly made cloak spells, not Aetherius.
  
  
**Aetherius - Racial Spells Addon**
  
  
This addon distributes a small number of spells to five of the ten playable races. The other five races no longer start with spells at all. Only affects the player, not NPCs. This addon requires [Mysticism](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839).
  
  

  
* **Argonians -** Poison Spray, Healing
**Breton -** Oakflesh, Healing, Conjure Spectral Wolf 
  
* **High Elves -** Sparks, Lesser Ward, Soul Trap
**Dark Elves -** Flames, Frenzy, Bound Dagge﻿r
  
* **Imperial -** Calm, Healing

**Aetherius - Lower Starting Skills Addon**
  
  
This addon reduces the level of all starting skills by 5 additional points. Major skills will still start at 20; Minor skills will start at 15; all other skills will start at 5. This addon is not recommended for general use; you will need to make some edits to your uncapper preset if you want to use this mod without leveling up the first time you hit someone with a Greatsword. (Alternatively, a mod like Experience or Static Skill Leveling should work as well). Note that in Adamant, you cannot take the first perk in a skill until that skill is level 10.
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
  
Aetherius is lightweight and compatible, and will not interfere with any mod (except for other mods that change race records). If you have [Spell Perk Item Distributor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869)installed, Aetherius will automatically distribute perks to NPCs that need them.
