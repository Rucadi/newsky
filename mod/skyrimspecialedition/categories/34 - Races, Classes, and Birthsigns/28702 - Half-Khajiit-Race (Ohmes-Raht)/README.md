I hopefully have fixed all the patches now, all should have form 44 and be flagged as ESL.**[size=4]**[size=5]Version 6.0 is now available**[size=5]!
  
[/size][/size]AlbinoWalrus64's **Bugfix and Immersionpatch** is now incorporated into the mod. Credit to her for the immersive description of the race!
  
Now including patches\* for:

* **[High Poly Heads](https://vectorplexus.com/files/file/283-high-poly-head/)﻿**[color=#ffffff], thanks to kboot[/color]
**[Slof's Fluffy Khajiit Tails](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30397)﻿﻿**[color=#ffffff], thanks to DaikonMods[/color]
  
* **[Imperious](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1315)﻿﻿**[color=#ffffff], thanks to AlbinoWalrus64[/color]
**[Aetherius](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26686)﻿﻿**[color=#ffffff], thanks to AlbinoWalrus64[/color]
  

*[right]\*All patches were entirely or partially rewritten by me to fit the changes in v6.[/right]*
  
Moreover I've fixed inconsistencies and cleaned up the mod as best as I could.
  
All files are now in their respective "HalfKhajiit" folders, no more overwriting of M'rissi files.
  
Due to that and other changes (see changelog) v6 will probably be incompatible with other patches.[size=3][size=3]

"Half-Khajiit", a race based on the main character from the follower-mod "M'rissi's Tail of Troubles" by KreaQ.[/size]
  
  
Big thank you to KreaQ for letting me use the Textures and Meshes from "M'rissi's Tail of Troubles"!![size=2][size=3]M'rissi is **not** a requirement but please go and play KreaQ's Mod and enjoy the amazing story about her [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/83063)!
  
  
Please note, that the Cat-ears will occasionally clip through some helmets, if the helmet isn't covering enough of the face.
  
I recommend just not use helmtes like any reasonable Skyrim player >.>

[size=4]**Just some Notes:**[/size][/size][size=2][size=3]
  
[/size][/size]

  
* **Catgirl versions have normal ears! Put some hair over it and change the ear-size down to the minimum in Racemenu**

  
* [size=2][size=3]This Mod is made to be used with a Female character, male characters are supported but not recommendet.[/size][/size]
[size=2][size=3]Becoming a Vampire works just like every other race. **You will even get two additional abilities.**[/size][/size]
  
* [size=2][size=3]I recommend using a long Hairstyle with the leopard version as it covers the texture seam around the neck.[/size][/size]
[size=2][size=3]**Don't change the face-color in racemenu**, as it may make the face-texture disappear.[/size][/size]
  
* [size=2][size=3]If the Ears disarppear or something like that, use "showracemenu" in the console and you should get everything back.[/size][/size]
[size=2][size=3][size=4]**If you get problems with the mouth, read "How to fix the mouth" below!**[/size][/size][/size]
  
* [size=2][size=3]It uses the nude body-textures from KreaQs mod, so it's kinda NSFW.[/size][/size]

  
If you find any more Bugs please contact me!
  
  
**[size=4]Note about the HighPolyHeadPatch:**[size=3]To use the high poly head go to "head" in racemenu and move the "facepart" slider to the highpoly head.[/size]
  
**ATTENTION:** for some reason the eye morphs glitch out as soon as you apply the high poly head for the first time, so please **do your eye editing first** and **then switch to the high poly head**. I have been unsuccessful in finding a solution for that until now.
  
**~~[size=4]How to fix the mouth/ears:~~** 
  
[From version 6.0.5 onwards the ears are directly attached to the mouth, they should no longer disappear][/size][/size]
