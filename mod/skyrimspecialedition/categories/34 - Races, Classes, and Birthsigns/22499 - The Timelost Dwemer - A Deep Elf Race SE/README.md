I wanted to make a dwemer mod that was not simply a texture swap and one or two racial abilities. I wanted a unique Deep Elf race with spells and abilities that no other race has access to in Skyrim: the latent ability to control time, and the skills to craft their own dwarven warmachines. Thus, the **Timelost Dwemer** was born.
  
  
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/45mVDag.png)
  
  
  
4000 years ago the entire Dwemer race was erased from existence. All that remained were their empty cities and the ceaseless automata that they left behind to guard them. Many centuries passed in their absence until something stirred in the Void. 
  
  
The fabric of time and space rippled and tore – and in a flash, a figure dropped to its knees in the wintry lands of Skyrim. The Timelost Dwemer stood, trembling – gazing upon the land with disturbing familiarity. Everything was where the ancients had left them, and buried beneath the mountains of Skyrim, the sins of the past beckoned to be found. The mer listened, and strode forth, knowing what had to be done. Evil walked the lands of Tamriel, and the forbidden secrets of the ancient Dwemer could not be allowed to fall into the wrong hands.
  
  
Not again.

Their skills and abilities are weighted towards sword and shield, and two-handed warriors. However, their unique chronokinetic racial abilities encourage high risk, high reward gameplay as players slow time and teleport into the fray. Their chrono powers also give them an edge in other pursuits, such as archery or sneaking.

* **ANCIENT DARKNESS** - You have been marked by a presence older than Oblivion. Thus, you may wield the **POWER OF THE VOID** to manipulate time and space with your latent **CHRONOKINESIS**, but at the cost of health and magicka.

  

  
* ﻿- Abusing your chronokinetic powers will cause you to develop **VOID PATHOSIS**, a chronic wasting disease that progresses into **VOID NECROSIS**, which slowly kills you.

  
  

  
* **MALEFICARUM** - 4000 years ago your people profaned all of creation with their abominable hubris, and were cursed for all of eternity. Thus, you are unable to regenerate magicka on your own, and you are 25% more vulnerable to all magic damage.

  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/xVUr8ZV.png)
  
  
No dwemer can be dissuaded from their quest for power and knowledge. Use your powerful dwemer intellect and ingenuity to adapt and survive, and conquer the curses that tried to humble you. 
  
  

  
* **MAGECRAFTER** - You are a Magecrafter: an engineer-sorcerer that can weave magic into machines and bring them to life.

  

  
* ﻿- Assemble powerful new devices that can strengthen your grasp over the powers of the Void, and protect you from its perils.

  

  
* ﻿- Construct 30+ varieties of **dwarven automata**, ranging from skittering **animunculi,** intelligent **simulacra,** to titanic warmachines.

  

  
* ﻿﻿- Forge new weapons, power armor, and explosives to annihilate your enemies with!

  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/Ve2nOMF.png)
  
**THE TIMELOST DWEMER** harness the perilous energies of the void to exert their will over space and time, but this great power comes at a price: their **CHONOKINETIC ABILITIES** are highly-unstable, and cause them to slowly fade back into the dimension whence they came.
  
﻿
  
Excessive use of chronokinesis can be fatal, but this damage can by mitigated by powerful new devices and equipment. 
  
  
  
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/s4yxl0g.png)
  
  
Wield powerful chronokinetic spells that reward high-risk, high-reward combat!
  
  

  
* **TIME WARP** - Once per day, freeze time and increase your attack speed by 550%.

  

  
* **TIME DILATION** - Slow time to 10% of its normal rate.

  

  
* **WARP JUMP** - Dive silently through the fabric of Mundus and teleport to a target location.

  

  
* **ASSAULT JUMP** - Hurl yourself through the fabric of Mundus. Your violent reentry back into the universe detonates a singularity at your destination that knocks down all enemies around you.
- ﻿It's like Biotic Charge from Mass Effect 3.

Timelost Dwemer can also wield more powerful chronokinetic abilities by assembling and equipping devices that further enhance their command of the void. 
  
  

  
* **NULL LANCE** - Unleash lances of void energy that vaporize magicka and slow movement speed.

  

  
* **ATTENUATE**- Emit a pulse that ceases the magicka regeneration of nearby enemies.

  

  
* **GRAVITY BOMB** - Detonate a singularity, damaging and hurling away nearby enemies.

  

  
* **END TIME** - Rip open a hole in space-time, summoning a black hole at a target location that annihilates anyone caught inside.

﻿The dwemer by nature covet power and knowledge above all else, but how far will they fall in this pursuit?
  
  
Enter the **TIMELOST VAMPIRE.**

**Dwemer vampires** gain new skills and improved chronokinesis that strengthens the more blood-starved they become. Some may say you are cursed by the void and by your unholy blood, but to a dwemer vampire, the unnatural powers you wield are the key to your ascension as a higher being. 
  
  

  
* **UNDEATH ASCENSION** - Giving into your bloodthirst hones your chronokinetic abilities. Teleport farther and slow time longer - but beware, your heightened powers come at the cost of a greater weakness to fire and magic.

  

  
* **VOID GRIP** - Timelost Dwemer vampires can strangulate their victim with the chilling embrace of the void, paralyzing them and doing damage over time.

  

  
* **VOID TEAR** - An improved variant of Void Grip: seize your victim and teleport them to you, paralyzing them and doing damage over time.
﻿﻿- It's like Death Grip from WoW.
  

  
* ﻿**Compatible** with **Better Vampires by default,** with patches for **Sacrosanct**and **Sacrilege**available!

![](https://i.imgur.com/lB3PsT6.png)
  
  

  
* **THE CALLING**- Once per day, override a hostile automaton’s behavior protocols with your mind, making it an ally for 12 hours.

  

  
* **REPAIR AUTOMATON** - repair your automata with concentrated, instant, or AOE repair spells that are unlocked as you unlock Magecrafter perks

* **DWEMER ARMS**– Deal 30% more damage with dwarven weapons.

* **AETHERIAL WARHAMMER** - Powered aetherial warhammer that staggers targets and ignores 100% of enemy armor.

  

  
* **ATRONACH CUBE** - Atronach Cubes absorb magic damage, and resist and regenerate magic. These invaluable machines come in five increasingly powerful varieties and help offset the effects of the Maleficarum Curse.

  

  
* **WARP CORE**- Warp Cores these devices augment your chronokinetic abilities, and allow you to harness more powerful spells like Assault Jump and Gravity Bomb. Comes in three increasingly powerful varieties.

  

  
* **HAEMOMANTIC WARP CORE** \*\* - Exclusive to vampires only. Similar to the original Warp Core, the Haemo Core improves the chrochronokinetic powers of vampiric dwemer, while also granting them Void Tear, as well as Assault Jump and Gravity Bomb.

* **TESSERACT CUBE** - Tesseract Cubes provide unlimited storage space within the infinite void inside them.

  

  
* **CHRONOKINETIC STABILIZER** - Chronokinetic Stabilizers are the pinnacle of Timelost Dwemer technology: they stabilize your chronokinetic abilities, preventing damage from the perilous energies of the void.

This mod fully-integrates a tweaked and expanded version of **TheBlackKnight3000's** [Dwarven Automaton Crafting](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71777) mod into the game. This mod would not have been made possible without TheBlackKnight3000's work.
  
  
Craft and command 30+ varieties of Dwarven Automata to aid you in combat. 
  
  
Spoiler
  
**DWEMER AUTOMATA** are advanced magical constructs designed and assembled by the Ancient Dwemer thousands of years ago. Since the disappearance of the Ancient Dwemer race, no civilization on Tamriel has been able to recreate this esoteric elven technology. These tireless machine servitors come in all shapes and sizes.
  
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/5fHtmoz.png)
  
There are five tiers of automata that you can unlock through the new Magecrafter perks, divided into two categories of automata: **ANIMUNCULI,** and **SIMULACRA.** 
  
  

  
* **Animunculi** are automata of varying degrees of sentience, such as spiders, spheres, and centurions
**Simulacra** are near-sapient Ancillary-Intelligences (AI) that you can recruit as followers. 
  

  
Each tier contains increasingly powerful and expensive automata that fit into different combat roles and with both strengths and weaknesses. 
  
  

  
* Automata are not summoned like spells.
They are assembled at blacksmith forges. 
  
* They are deployed from throwable, Pokeball-style containment spheres, and can be stored and repaired.
Some automatons can even be upgraded to stronger, advanced variants!
  

  
For instructions on how to operate and maintain automata, you may read the ingame books you start with, or the Mod Documentation further below.
  
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/UleEZlV.png) 
  
While you may craft your own automata, you may salvage and capture hostile automata, too!
  
  

  
* **AUTOMATON SALVAGE** - Salvage the wrecks of defeated automata and rebuild them!

  

  
* **PROTOCOL ASSIMILATION** - Break the ciphers of hostile automata, and make them your minions!

[spoiler]
  
**\* Requires Extra Automatons addon**
  
**\*\* Requires Vampirism**
  
  
TIER 1
  
[spoiler]
  
**SPIDER**
  
Spiders are small, compact, arachnoid automata. Although they are tasked primarily with janitorial and maintenance duties they are also quite capable of defending themselves and their worksites, as well as their creators. They are fast, scurrying about with their clacking legs before lashing out from a distance with bolts of magical lightning. In melee, they leap at their enemies to tear at them with their mechanical claws.
  
  
**BALESPIDER \***
  
Balespiders are small, fast, and capable fighters, much like their shock-magic infused cousins. However, rather than lashing out from range with lightning magic, Balespiders hurl firebolts at their enemies, lighting them on fire before leaping forth to tear at them with their spindly metal legs. 
  
  
**BOLT SPIDER \***
  
Bolt Spiders use miniature crossbows to attack their foes. These crossbows fire armor-piercing bolts that are effective at taking down heavily-armored targets. Although capable of engaging at both melee and range, Bolt Spiders prefer to provide fire support with their crossbows. 
  
  
**OBSERVER**
  
Observers are floating ball-shaped constructs charged with magical electricity that saps magicka away from their foes. Observers bounce and flit about, dodging attacks before landing swift, crushing blows that stagger their enemies. Originally designed for exploring and mapping out underground caverns and even the surface, Observers can pack quite a punch, ramming foes with their heavy frames and electrifying them upon contact. 
  
  
**FLAYER**
  
Flayers are dangerous, worm-like constructs designed to mutilate enemies with their flesh-rending, spiked frames. Meant not to wage war but to inflict terror, Flayers tear gaping, bleeding wounds into their helpless foes, leaving behind unrecognizable heaps of ruined flesh in their chattering wake. Often found in packs, Flayers engage their foes from a distance, hurling fireballs at them before closing in for the kill. 
  
  
**BLOODLETTER \*\***
  
Bloodletters are haemomantic variants of Flayers. Their spiked frames crackle and glow with forbidden blood magic, and their attacks drain the life of their foes. In combat, bloodletters siphon vitality to their vampire master with haemomantic blood bolts.
  
  
**VENATOR**
  
Venators are beast-like warmachines capable of charging their foes and mauling them with powerful, crushing blows. These constructs are fast and deadly, closing the distance between their foes in mere seconds before striking them down. Often accompanying dwemer legions in battle, these machines lie in wait until the line-troops have the enemy pinned in melee before flanking them from the sides or chasing down skirmishers. 
  
  
**HELOT**
  
Helots are mer-shaped animunculi with strong, mechanized limbs designed for menial labor. Unlike advanced simulacra, Helots operate on simpler programming and can only perform menial tasks and engage in single-minded combat. Helots are often found in mines, plumbing the earth for precious metals and ores, or aiding in the construction of cities. 
  
  
Although they are designed for labor, these automata are not to be underestimated, as their powerful limbs can drive an axe through plated armor, or crush bone and mail alike.
  
  
  
TIER 2
  
Spoiler
  
**SEEKER**
  
Seekers are small, Autonomous Explosive Devices. These suicide drones explode upon death or after a five second fuse, or upon remote detonation, consuming anyone unfortunate enough to step on or crush them in magical spellfire. 
  
  
﻿Variants:
  
﻿**﻿Fire, Frost,** and **Storm Seekers**
  
﻿﻿Magecrafter perks unlock Volatile and Advanced variants with stronger and larger blast radii. 
  
  
**BALLISTA**
  
Ballistae are automated, light artillery pieces. They are armed with miniature ballistae, launching powerful, armor-piercing bolts from afar to impale even the most heavily-armored foes. 
  
  
Ballistae are accurate and dangerous skirmishers, but they are extremely vulnerable in melee, and should be screened with proper support.
  
  
**SPHERE**
  
Spheres are partially-humanoid automata, guarding and patrolling dwemer cities and roads. Aptly-named, Spheres can fold themselves into balls, allowing them to roll through pipes and other inaccessible areas. 
  
  
Upon detecting a hostile, they unfold and charge, attacking with arm-mounted swords and crossbows. Often underestimated by their seemingly harmless, spherical shapes, these automata are fast and aggressive, chasing down or cutting down their foes with well-placed crossbow-fire. 
  
  
﻿Variants:
  
**﻿﻿Flame Sphere, Storm Sphere** - equipped with explosive elemental crossbow bolts. 
  
  
**REPAIR SPIDER**
  
Repair Spiders repair nearby friendly automata. Although capable of fighting, they are not as strong as other spider variants, and prefer to electrocute their enemies from range. 
  
  
﻿Variants: 
  
**﻿﻿Repair Balespider \***
  
**MEDI SPIDER**
  
Medi Spiders heal nearby friendly combatants. Although capable of fighting, they are not as strong as other spider variants, and prefer to electrocute their enemies from range. 
  
  
﻿Variants:
  
**﻿﻿Medi Balespider \***
  
**ARMIGER**
  
Armigeri are advanced meric Simulacra, programmed with a near-sapient Ancillary-Intelligence. Armigeri are hardy and robust, and are designed to serve as heavy infantry on the battlefield.  
  
  
Their modular exoskeletons can be equipped with heavy armor, and they are adept at wielding anything from swords to greatswords, and even bows and crossbows. These automata can shrug off blows that most men and mer cannot. Armigeri will hold them line.
  
  
﻿﻿Variants:
  
﻿﻿Upgradeable to the **MK II Armiger**, which boasts combat skills and performance that are superior to the MK I.
  
  
**PACKHORSE**
  
Packhorses fulfill the purpose that their name implies: they carry things. These mechanical beasts will carry your burdens. 
  
  
**ANCILLA**
  
Ancillae are shapely, feminine Simulacra. Nominally-designed for pleasure and household duties, Ancillae are highly-modular and can be equipped for combat. These Ancillae often serve as maids for dwemer nobles, care for their children, or entertain them and their guests at extravagant gatherings. 
  
When their masters are threatened, Ancillae leap into action, hacking apart their foes, or disintegrating them with magical lightning. Ancillae are especially adept at stealth, and can remain undetected among hostiles. 
  
  
﻿Variants:
  
﻿﻿Upgradeable to the **MK II Ancilla,** which boasts combat skills and performance that are superior to the MK I.
  
  
**ANCILLA SPELLSWORD**
  
Ancilla Spellswords wield both blade and magic. 
  
  
﻿Variants:
  
**﻿﻿﻿Ancilla Stormswords** unleash streams of crackling lightning that leave lingering, electrifying damage.
  
﻿﻿﻿- Upgradeable to the MK II Stormsword that casts Lightning Bolts in battle. 
  
﻿﻿﻿**Ancilla Flamesword** unleash gouts of flames that lights their foes on fire.
  
﻿﻿﻿- Upgradeable to the MK II Flamesword that hurl Firebolts in battle. 
  
**﻿﻿Ancilla Bloodborne \*\*** unleash life-draining blood magic that heal their vampire masters. 
  
﻿﻿﻿- Upgradeable to the MK II Bloodborne \*\* that hurls Bloodbolts in battle.
  
**STRIDER**
  
Striders are lithe, yet sturdy feminine warmachines designed to wade into the heat of battle and sweep aside surrounding foes. They are programmed for shock combat, shrugging off blows that would crush even the most well-armored mer, and retaliating with powerful, fiery melee attacks. 
  
Their magical cores are enchanted with self-repairing sorcery, which quickly buffs dents and reattaches parts even in the heat of battle. These warmachines will stand their ground against any odds.
  
  
**WITCHSLAYER**
  
Witchslayers are brutal hunter-killer units designed to defeat sorcerers. Their attacks tear apart flesh and pulverize bone, but these are the least of their powers: these automata sap the magicka from their foes, disabling them and preventing spellcasting. 
  
 
  
They are dangerously quick, relentlessly pursuing enemy spellcasters and slaughtering them like animals. Their heavy frames are highly-resistant to magic, and only the most powerful of conventional attacks can stop them.

Spoiler
  
**TEMPESTA**
  
Tempestae are partially-humanoid, feminine automata that wield powerful lightning magic. They hover about the battlefield, unleashing lightning strikes upon their foes, disintegrating them and casting their ashes into the wind. 
  
  
They are fast, and will often evade melee combat, dodging arrows and swords alike, only engaging in close combat when cornered. Tempests prefer to blast apart their foes with their electrified sorcery. Their lightning attacks are so powerful that they will often utterly obliterate weaker and unarmored enemies, and stagger stronger ones.
  
  
﻿Variants
  
﻿Upgradeable to the MK II Tempesta, which can unleash Chain Lightning onto their foes. 
  
  
**DRAKAINA**
  
Drakainai are powerful, fire-wielding automata. Designed with a lithe, feminine shape, these graceful constructs are as deadly as they are beautiful: their roiling power-cores are enchanted with fire magic that glows with tinges of superheated, bluish flame.
  
 
  
Drakainai lob fireballs that can melt through even the thickest of platemail. Those who are simply incinerated are the lucky ones, as their fiery attacks often cook their helpless foes inside their burning armor. Although vulnerable in melee, Drakainai are capable of defending themselves with kicks and swipes that light their attackers on fire.
  
  
﻿Variants
  
﻿﻿Upgradeable to the MK II Drakaina, which can hurl Fireballs at their foes. 
  
  
**DRAKON \***
  
Drakontes are among the dwemer’s strongest and most robust automated infantry. Designed to be an amalgamation of mer and dragon, Drakontes glow with burning spellfire that radiates from their magically-enchanted cores. Wielding fire-enchanted battleaxes, Drakontes breathe fire upon their enemies before wading into battle and cleaving them apart.
  
  
**SPIDER CHARIOT \***
  
Arachnovamidia are huge warmachines, used as mounts and powerful magical artillery pieces. They may be ridden into battle, used as transportation, or ranged fire support.
  
  
**TYRANT**
  
Tyrants are among the dwemer’s most terrifying killing machines. They are armed with vicious arm-swords that they use to slash apart their foes in savage, brutal combat. 
  
  
On the battlefield, these blood-bathed constructs launch terrifying shock attacks upon enemy troops, disrupting formations and slaughtering those who are unable to withstand their whirling storm of metal. When damaged, Tyrants can enter berserker mode, allowing them to shrug off the mightiest of blows and continue fighting. They are truly a savage, and dangerous foe.
  
  
**PRAETORIAN**
  
Praetorians are towering warmachines that seek out the strongest and largest foes on the battlefield to engage them in single combat. Armed with a variety of giant weapons, Praetorians cut down monsters and soldiers alike, hurling them aside and launching them into the air like ragdolls. 
  
  
Although not as sturdy as Centurions, Praetorians are a force to be reckoned with, and are often sent to disrupt enemy lines with their powerful attacks.
  
  
**CENTURION**
  
Centurions are some of the most advanced automata ever designed. These walking siege engines are slow but immense, and can shrug off many attacks and squash their foes like insects. 
  
  
Armed with a giant warhammer in one arm, and an equally giant battleaxe in the other, Centurions besiege castles and knock down gates before pulverizing the hapless foes cowering behind them. When surrounded, Centurions can vent steam from their engines, boiling away flesh from bone and driving back their scalded attackers.
  
  
  
TIER 4
  
Spoiler
  
**INFERNAL**
  
Infernals are larger, rarer variations of Centurions, built to guard areas of extreme importance, or to lay waste to enemy fortifications. Whereas their smaller cousins were designed for knocking down gates, Infernals knock down walls. 
  
  
These towering warmachines stride across the battlefield, towering over their foes and annihilating them with their massive arm-mounted weapons, and obliterating those that remain with hellish magical flames. 
  
  
**DEATHWING**
  
Deathwings are some of the rarest, most advanced, and most complex automata ever designed. Some may even say that these constructs contain fully-sapient Ancillary-Intelligence. Whatever it is that drives these machines to prosecute Dwemer wars with such calculated destruction is unknown, but they are more than willing - if not happy to bring death upon the enemies of their creators. 
  
  
Built in the dreadful image of the ancient dragons, these legendary and fearsome warmachines strike fear in the hearts of entire armies as their winged shadows fall upon them. This is often the last they see before they are utterly disintegrated in brilliant storms of magical lightning.
  
  
  
TIER 5
  
Spoiler
  
**COLOSSUS \***
  
Colossi are awe-inspiring and horrifying sights on the battlefield. The immense presence of these titanic warmachines alone can rout and defeat entire armies. Colossi are so large that one colossus alone could assault a castle and lay waste to its cowering defenders. A Colossus is a walking meteor strike, pounding its enemies into extinction with spellfire-enchanted fists, or tearing huge rents into the earth with their colossal powered weaponry. Their magical power cores burn with the fire of a raging inferno, and simply being close to one can ignite cloth and flesh, and melt away armor and bone. 
  
  
When a Colossus enters the battlefield, very few live to tell the tale.[/spoiler][/spoiler]

**Ashtaret**
  
**Traits:** Two-Handed, Heavy Armor, **Summon Animunculus Guardian: Zara** (Zara's remains must be recovered to enable this ability; see Ash's inventory for hints)
  
[spoiler]
  
Ashtaret, in the early days of the First Era, was the daughter of a noble family who enjoyed the finer life of the dwemer aristocracy. Belonging to the minor but respected Clan Namtara of Arkngthamz, she had access to great wealth - wealth that she squandered on her decadent and libertine lifestyle... much to the disdain of her parents. However, the discovery of aetherium in Blackreach sparked the Aetherium Wars, and many of Clan Namtara marched off to war only to be killed by their own kin. Ashtaret, with her parents and most of her friends and family dead, found herself alone for the first time in her life. Ashamed that she had done nothing but indulge in vice and vanity as her parents fell in battle and Clan Namtara burned, she swore to her ancestors that she would restore her and her family's honor.
  
  
As the Aetherium Wars came to a close, and Arkngthamz lay in ruin, Ashtaret mustered what little of her family's wealth that remained and delved into the science of magecrafting. From apprentice to master, Ashtaret constructed automata that helped rebuild and revitalize her city after the destruction of the Aetherium Wars. Centuries passed, and the dwemer empire thrived once again - thanks in part to some of Ashtaret's patented automaton designs. Now, as a master magecrafter, Ashtaret had finally restored the honor and respect Clan Namtara had held in ages past. However, she was still the sole surviving progeny of her clan. With Arkngthamz restored to its former glory, she decided that it was time to settle down and start a family of her own. However, this dream was never realized. 
  
  
In the 700th year of the First Era, the upstart chimer of Resadyn declared war upon their dwemer neighbors. Ashtaret joined the Arkngthamzite legion, and drilled and practiced in the art of swordsmanship in case their dwemeri allies in Resdayn called for their aid. Though far from the carnage, Ashtaret felt a strange and inexplicable force pull her into nothingness and she and the rest of the dwemer disappeared from the face of the universe.
  
  
In the void, four-thousand years passed in the blink of an eye, and once more, Ashtaret found herself in Arkngthamz - but it was not the Arkgnthamz she once knew. Surrounded by mutant falmer, Ashtaret took up arms against the vagrant savages and slew her way out of the city and into a completely different world. She looked upon the land of Skyrim and saw distant lights and cities that she could not remember. The world had changed in her absence, and once again, she found herself alone. Confused and quaking with despair, Ashtaret gathered her wits and wandered Skyrim, hoping to carve out a new life for herself in that strange new world. 
  
  
  
**Nizrok**
  
**Traits:** One-Handed, Block, Heavy Armor, **Power Armor Training** (can wear personal power armor; see Nizrok's inventory for hints to its location)
  
Spoiler
  
Nizrok was a family mer, but remained distant from his kin because of the years he spent soldiering in the dwemer legions. During his service to the kingdom of Bthar-zel, he had seen and slain at least one of every man, mer, and monster that walked the lands of Skyrim. Whenever he returned home, his children, much older than the last he saw him, would shy away from him. To them, he was nothing but a stranger in their eyes. Saddened by the rift that had grown between him and his children, Nizrok promised to his wife that he would soldier no more. Finally settling down, Nizrok looked forward to rebuilding his family and becoming part of their lives. Just as he was opening his first chthonic food emporium, the Aetherium Wars shook the foundations of the dwemer empire. Bthar-zel, his home city, conscripted every able-bodied mer to fight against the forces of Arkngthamz for control over its rich aetherium stockpile.
  
  
With a heavy heart, Nizrok donned his armor and carried his shield and axe into battle once more, leaving behind his family. The war was a devastating one, and countless dwemer perished as it raged across Skyrim. Worse, as the dwemer city-states fought amongst themselves, the nords saw an opportunity for conquest, and swept across Skyrim to lay waste to dwemer lands. While the legions of Bthar-zel were fighting against the Arkngthamzites, the nords preyed upon the city. As the Aetherium Wars came to a close, Nizrok returned from the war to find Bthar-zel utterly destroyed. He dug through the rubble of his home until his fingers bled and he despaired. His family was nowhere to be found. His wife and children were gone forever. Without a home and a family, Nizrok fell into a deep depression that threatened to consume him, and he cast himself off into the wilderness of Skyrim with nothing but his old legionary armor. 
  
  
For many centuries, Nizrok wandered Tamriel as a traveling mercenary, honing his fighting skills and swinging his axe for coin until his journey came to an end in the distant lands of Resadyn. When another elven war broke out, Nizrok, empty from working the honorless job of a mercenary, thought that he could find purpose in life once more by joining the dwemer legions of King Dumac. As a weathered veteran of the Aetherium Wars, Dumac's dwemer legions accepted him wholeheartedly into their ranks, and they marched against the chimeri armies at the Battle of Red Mountain.
  
  
It was there, in the heat of battle that Nizrok felt his skin crawl and nothingness swallowed him whole. Then, just as quickly as the darkness had come, a light erupted around him and hurled him into the carnage of the Red Year. Hunted by roving bands of argonian dunmer-slayers, Nizrok fled Resdayn - now known as Morrowind, and joined a group of dunmer refugees on their way to Solsteim. There, Nizrok settled down for the first time in centuries (or thousands of years), and it was there that he finally found peace in the loving embrace of a dunmer woman named Nirina, whom he later called his wife. This woman made him whole again, and for once he finally felt at peace. 
  
  
Together, Nizrok and Nirina built a dwarven ceramics business, and he sometimes travels to the Skyrim mainland to secure trade deals with the nords of Markarth who are eager to collect his authentic dwarven art. Currently, he is stuck in Skyrim proper for the time being, unable to return to Solsteim due to Imperial and Stormcloak naval blockades around the mainland.

Spoiler
  
\* Ashtaret and Nizrok will probably spawn a Hunting Bow into their inventory when first recruited. This is a bug that all custom followers have. You will need to remove the bow from their inventories, or they may not use their own weapons. You only need to do this once. I can't fix this without breaking every follower mod out there, so manually removing that stupid Hunting Bow from his inventory ingame is the only way around this bug (thanks Bethesda[/spoiler]

I aim to provide updates and bugfixes for this mod when I am able. These updates should not break your save, however, there are some steps you should take to make sure your character's traits are updated properly. 
  
  
There is no need to conduct these procedures unless stated in the changelog.
  
  
  
**Standard Updating Procedure**
  
This is the standard updating procedure for 1.0 and above, unless specifically stated otherwise.
  
[spoiler]
  
- Hit Tilde ~ to open the console, type in 'showracemenu' (without quotes) and press enter
  
- You will now be in the RaceMenu Screen. Make any changes you want (you don't need to) and press R to save and finish
  
- You should see on the top left of your screen: "Timelost Dwemer perks and spells have been added successfully."
  
- Done!
  
  
  
**Advanced Updating Procedure**
  
Do not use this updating procedure unless instructed to.
  
Spoiler
  
- Hit Tilde ~ to open the console, type in 'showracemenu' (without the quotes) and press enter
  
- You will now be in the RaceMenu Screen. If you are using the RaceMenu mod or ECE, I suggest that you save a character preset of your current character before continuing 
  
- Change your character's race to any other race 
  
- Press R and confirm your changes, and return to the game. You should see the message at the top left of the screen: "Timelost Dwemer perks and spells have been removed successfully"
  
- Open the console a second time, and enter RaceMenu again
  
- Change your character back to a Deep Elf, load your the character preset you saved
  
- Press R and confirm your changes, and return to the game. You should see a message on the top left of your screen: "Timelost Dwemer perks and spells have been added successfully." Your new skill bonuses should be applied, and the Smite ability should be in your spellbook
  
  
You may also need to rebuild your Bashed Patch if I update the leveled lists, but I will let you know if you need to.

If you want to use your own custom textures to fit your custom body meshes, all you need to do is replace this mod's textures with yours. 
  
  
Open the Timelost Dwemer Essential's Patcher and simply drag and drop your textures (such as femalebody\_1.dds, femalebody\_0.dds, etc) into the following folder:
  
  
...\The Timelost Dwemer - A Deep Elf Race\Textures\deep elf\male
  
  
or
  
  
...\The Timelost Dwemer - A Deep Elf Race\Textures\deep elf\female
  
  
Click yes to overwrite any files if asked.
  
  
If that doesn't work, then make sure the Essential's Patcher is overwriting the main mod.
  
  
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/SpsB57l.png)
  
Spoiler
  
If you're a Vortex user, then it's more complicated because Vortex is inferior doesn't give users the necessary controls needed to manually-modify their load order. 
  
  

  
* Open the contents of the Essential's Patcher
Drag and drop your textures (such as femalebody\_1.dds, femalebody\_0.dds, etc) into the following folders 
  
* ﻿...\The Timelost Dwemer - A Deep Elf Race\Textures\deep elf\male
﻿and or ...\The Timelost Dwemer - A Deep Elf Race\Textures\deep elf\female
  
* Copy the entire contents of the Essential's Patcher and paste them into the main mod's folder.
Overwrite when prompted. This will manually-overwrite the assets of the main mod with the contents of the Essential's Patcher.

I wrote up a thorough and detailed documentation for this mod, and I usually edit it with every major update when I have time. 
  
  
The documentation covers the following topics: 
  
  
\* Automaton deployment, capture, assimilation, and maintenance 
  
\* Descriptions of the mod's spells, perks, weapons, armors, and automatons
  
\* Detailed crafting guide with charts/material lists for all the items and automatons added to the game
  
\* Gameplay tips and strategies

**These skin tones aren't lore friendly, they break my immersion,** [peepee poopoo skin tone bad etc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFkJz3-AuVk)
  

  
* If my dwemer skin tones are not to your liking, you can change them by replacing my mod's textures. Instructions on how to do this are under the Customization section of the mod description.

**Will you make a friendly automaton plugin?**
  

  
* No.

  
  
  
**Can you make a standalone version? I only want to play with the race/spells/perks/automatons etc**
  

  
* ﻿No.

  
  
  
**How do I craft/salvage/capture the automatons?**
  

  
* You start with several books in your inventory. Perhaps you should read them.

  
  
  
**How do I craft the crixic powders?**
  

  
* See the previous answer.

  
  
  
**How do I remove or overcome the Maleficarum Curse?**
  

  
* You can nerf or remove the curse by selecting the mod's difficulty when installing the mod. This only works on new playthroughs.
You can overcome the curse ingame by enchanting your armor with magic resistance or magic regeneration enchantments, and constructing the new Timelost Dwemer items. 
  

  
  
  
**Help! My dwemer don't look like the dwemer in your screenshots!**
  

  
* You forgot to install the ESSENTIALS PATCHER from [The Timelost Dwemer Patch Center.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53412) Make sure it loads AFTER the main mod, meaning the contents of the Essentials Patcher must overwrite the Timelost Dwemer's mod folder.

  

  
* If you installed the ESSENTIALS PATCHER and the skins still aren't changing, then you're probably using Vortex. Vortex doesn't give you the same amount of load order control as Mod Organizer does (cough Vortex is inferior cough) you need to do some extra work.
For instructions, see the spoiler below:
  

[spoiler]
  

  
* You need to open the contents of the Essentials Patcher, and cut and paste it into the main mod's folder. Select yes if asked if you want to overwrite.

**Can I harvest my blood to complete Septimus Signus's quest (Discerning the Transmundane)? How?**
  

  
* Simply click the Essence Extractor, and you will sample your blood!

  
  
  
**The Multiballista, Manuscorpio, Autoballista - Autocrossbows in general are missing models or aren't working!**
  

  
* You must download and install the ESSENTIALS PATCHER from [The Timelost Dwemer Patch Center.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53412)

  
  
  
**My game is crashing on start!**
  

  
* You are most likely missing a requirement. Read through the installation guide again and make sure you installed every requirement needed for the mod to function. If you installed any plugins or patches, you must make sure their requirements are installed, too.

  
  
  
**I started a new game and I'm crashing when I select Deep Elves in RaceMenu!**
  
  

  
* This can be caused by one of several things, but it is all related to the male body meshes or textures in some way, shape or form:

  
* ﻿- You chose the SOS body in the installer, but didn't install Schlongs of Skyrim
﻿- You chose the SOS Light body in the installer, but didn't install Schlongs of Skyrim Light
  
* ﻿- You chose the SkySight Skins body in the installer, but didn't install Skysight Skins
﻿- There is a mod in your load order that is overwriting the SOS, SOSL, or SkySight Skins body meshes and causing CTD's
  
* ﻿- You are using incompatible Oldrim textures in SSE (not all Oldrim textures are compatible with SSE)

  
* Please make sure you installed the right requirements, and that there are no incompatible mod conflicts in your load order. If anything overwrites the male body meshes that SOS or SOSL provides, you will most likely crash. If you chose SOS or SOSL in the installer, and you do not have either of the two main mods installed, you WILL crash for sure.

  
  
  
**My male deep elves have holes in their crotches!**
  

  
* You are missing the Deep Elf SOS Plugin. You need both SOS/SOS Light and the Deep Elf SOS Plugin if you want your male deep elves to have genitals.

  
* If you have the Deep Elf SOS Plugin installed, and your Deep Elf males still have holes in their crotches, you may need to manually-apply their schlongs. Make sure to apply the Deep Elf schlong.

  
  
**Vampirism isn't working!**
  
or
  
**My character isn't getting his/her Better Vampires/Sacrosanct/Sacrilege spells!**
  
  

  
1. Reinstall RaceCompatibility, and make sure you selected the corresponding patch for the vampire overhaul you use (you can only pick one)
Reinstall the Timelost Dwemer, and make sure you installed the corresponding patch for the vampire overhaul you use (you can only pick one)
  
2. Read the Load Order section of the mod description under Installation > Load Order. You must load the vampire overhaul mod folders, plugins, and patches in a particular order for things to work.

  
  
  
**Where are the Deep Elf followers?**
  

  
* ﻿Ashtaret is in Arkngthamz, Ereshkiga is in Nchuand-Zel Excavation, and Nizrok is in the War Quarter in Blackreach.

  
  
  
**Do NPC's refer to me as a deep elf ingame?**
  

  
* ﻿By default, they don’t, but if you install [Race Compatibility Dialogue SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17595) then NPC’s will think you’re a dark elf.

  
  
  
**The Deep Elf race isn't showing up in RaceMenu!**
  

  
* ﻿If the Deep Elf race isn't showing up in RaceMenu, make sure you are using RaceMenu, and the most updated version of RaceCompatibility.

  
  
  
**Where and how do I build a Colossus?**
  

  
1. You need the Extra Automatons plugin
You need the second and final level of the Master Magecrafter perk
  
2. You must craft it at the Aetherium Forge

  
  
  
**How do I operate power armor (AKA Aetherial Dwemervamidium)?**
  

  
* You must have at least one Aetherium Fuel Rod in your inventory, and you must learn Power Armor Training from a training skillbook (which can be found in the Reachwind Eyrie and in the Winterhold library).

  
  
  
**Which KS Hairdos do I need for the Follower Plugin? Will you make an HDT version?**
  

  
* You must install the NON-HDT version of KS Hairdos.
No I will not make an HDT version of my followers. 
  

  
  
  
**Nexus Mod Manager isn't installing this mod correctly!**
  

  
* Don't install with NMM.

  
  
  
**The Deep Elf SOS Schlong isn't showing up on my male character!**
  

  
* Make sure you installed the right SOS schlong. My mod provides compability for SOS's 3 default schlong shapes. You must pick one in the Timelost Dwemer SOS installer, as well as a Futa schlong for CBBE

  
* You may have to manually-apply the schlong to your character via the SOS MCM

  
  
  
**How do I equip parts onto or give items to my Gynoid/Armatus/Packhorse?**
  

  
* First you need to ask them to follow you. You will then be able to access their inventory via dialogue. Simply add any item you want them to use into their inventory, and they'll equip it, if possible.

  
  
  
**My textures look messed up!**
  

  
* Make sure you load the Essentials Patcher AFTER the main mod's folder.

  
* If you’re experiencing weird texture stretching on females or males, then you might have installed the wrong textures. For example, if you are using CBBE, you MUST install the CBBE option in my mod's installer. If you are using Skysight Skins, you must install the Skysight Skins option in my mod's installer etc

  
  
  
  
**Does X dwemer armor or X weapon mod work with the dwemer buffs?**
  

  
* As long as the armor or weapon is tagged with the DwemerMaterial keyword, then they will be buffed by my deep elf race's racial abilities. If it isn't, then it can be added to the equipment easily via the CK or XEdit.

  
  
  
**Is there an Xbox One port? Xbone port when?**
  

  
* I don't own an Xbox so I have no plans to port the mod. Other users are welcome to try though, provided they ask me for permission and follow my mod's permissions.

  
  
**Is this mod compatible with Growl?**
  

  
* See the Installation > Load Order > Growl section.

  
  
  
**My female deep elves have discolored or brighter-colored faces!**
  

  
* ﻿You are probably using a face texture that is incompatible with the deep elf skin that you selected in the installer. You must use face textures that are compatible with the skin that you installed.

  
  
  
**Can you make Ashtaret into a character preset?**
  

  
* No, sorry!

  
  
  
**New penis mod came out. Can you make a patch for it?**
  

  
* ![](https://media.tenor.com/images/bc1e643e29c7667399c85ca8dc10407f/tenor.gif)

  
  
  
**When is the Xivkyn race coming?**
  

  
* Not anytime soon!

**DEEP ELF MALE FOREHEAD BUG (AKA: HELICOPTER-LANDING PAD FOREHEAD) [Fixable]**
  
[spoiler]Caused by switching from the female sex to male sex in racemenu. Can be fixed by dragging the Face Part slider to the left until the forehead looks normal again. See pictures below:

[/spoiler]
  
  
  
**BEAST FORM REVERTS TO VAMPIRE RACE [Fixable]**
  
SpoilerEntering Beast Form and reverting back to your humanoid form transforms you to a vampire.
  
  
This can be fixed by adding the Dwemer Werewolf Fix item to your inventory and equipping it before you activate Beast Form.
  
 
  
You can obtain this item by entering the console with tilde ~ and typing in: help "dwemer werewolf fix" (with quotes) and add the item to your inventory with player.additem \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 1 (where the blank is the item's code)
  
  
  
  
**WARP JUMP CLIPPING [User error]**
  
SpoilerWarp Jump may clip you through walls and cause you to fall through the earth. Not much I can really do about that so just be careful of where you warp jump to, and always try to aim at the floors. 
  
  
  
  
**DELAYED SLOW TIME EFFECT [User variable]**
  
SpoilerThe Slow Time effect may trigger later than it should, or sometimes not at all when using Warp Jump, Gravity Bomb, or End Time.
  

  
* - This is caused by script lag, which occurs if a user has too many script-heavy mods running, or if a user has low FPS. Basically, Papyrus runs as fast as your framerate, and if your FPS is too low, or if Papyrus is clogged up, my slow time scripts may execute later, or they may not execute at all.
  
  
  
**SUPER SLOW TIME [Unverified mod incompatibility]**
  
SpoilerIf you are using any shout or slow time related mods, you might experience the super slow time bug. You should disable or uninstall these if you want to play this mod.
  
  
  
  
**AUTOMATON NOT DEPLOYING [User variable; fixable]**
  
SpoilerSometimes your automaton will not deploy when you drop your containment sphere
  

  
* - This can be caused by script lag.
﻿- Basically, Papyrus runs as fast as your framerate, and if your FPS is too low, or if Papyrus is clogged up, my slow time scripts may execute later, or they may not execute at all. 
  
* - Try picking it up and deploying it again, or go indoors and deploy in there
- Sometimes your automaton’s containment sphere can bug out and you will need to either craft a new one, or add a new one to your inventory via the console.
  
* ﻿- Just make sure you get rid of the bugged automaton first by either removing it from your inventory or disabling it in the console
  
  
  
  
**"FILE PATH TOO LONG" ERROR IN VORTEX/MOD ORGANIZER WHEN INSTALLING**
  
Spoiler
  
If you can't install due to a "File Path too long" error in your mod manager, download the mod manually from the site, and rename the .zip file that you downloaded to something shorter, like "TLD.zip". Then try installing it again, manually

[spoiler]
  
0.9b RC 1.0
  
Initial closed beta release
  
  
0.9b RC 1.1 
  
Worldspace:
  
\* Fixed the hole in ground at the Understone Keep's entrance. You won't fall through it when you enter from the front door anymore.
  
  
0.9b RC 1.2 
  
Perks:
  
\* Updated the description of Magecrafter perks to show what requirements you need to unlock them.
  
  
Chronokinesis:
  
\* Reduced Warp Jump's Time Shifting damage to 20 per use
  
\* Reduced Time Dilation's Time Shifting damage to 10 per use

\* Time Warp's Time Shifting damage now does a total of 90 damage over 12 seconds
  
\* New Ability: Gravity Bomb - Once per day, if you have an Advanced Warp Core or a Chromatic Warp Core equipped, overload your warp core, briefly creating a gravitational singularity before detonating it, hurling away all enemies within 50 feet of the detonation and dealing 50 damage to them over 5 seconds. Inflicts 9.6(\*1.25) per second for 5 seconds.
  
  
Items:
  
\* All Atronach Cubes now use Slot 55 rather than Slot 60. This should prevent them from being unequipped if you are using Dual Sheath Redux
  
\* All Warp Cores now buff Time Warp

0.9b RC 1.3 
  
Automatons 
  
\* Gynoids, Armati, and Packhorses have been reworked to be compatible with multiple follower overhauls
  
- When you deploy a Gynoid, Gynoid Spellsword, Armatus, or a Packhorse, the Containment Sphere will choose from a leveled list of unique, named animunculi to spawn (Gynoids will spawn 'Iztar Alpha - Omega', Armati will spawn 'Nerchul Alpha - Lambda', and Packhorses will spawn Mzarduk 'Alpha - Lambda')
  
- these individual animunculus actors can be managed as if they were individual followers, where previously each Gynoid, Armatus, or Packhorse was essentially a duplicate of the same individual (which prevented you from giving their duplicates equipment)
  
- NOTE: You can only have 12 of each Gynoid, Gynoid Spellsword, Armatus, and Packhorse type before the game starts making duplicates again (these duplicates will not be compatible with follower overhauls)
  
\* New automaton: Gynoid Flamesword - Gynoid variant that uses Gynoid Flamesword
  
\* Renamed Gynoid Spellsword to Gynoid Stormsword
  
\* Remade the Armatus automaton because I couldn't figure out why the original Armatus couldn't use weapons
  
- this new, remade variety of Armati should fight with any weapon you give them rather than fighting with their fists -.-
  
\* Gave Armati their own armor so it wouldn't be overwritten by other mods
  
- Only Armati can wear the following items without becoming invisible:
  
- Dwarven Armatus Boots, Dwarven Armatus Armor, Dwarven Armatus Gauntlets, Dwarven Armatus Helmet, and Dwarven Armatus Shield
  
- these items can be crafted on their own, or converted from regular Dwarven armor pieces (for example: bring a Dwarven Shield to a forge, and just convert it into a Dwarven ARMATUS Shield)
  
- Armati now have a variety of helmets to use 
  
- these helmets look different but have the same stats
  
\* Armati now require Greater Soul Gems to build, rather than Common Soul Gems.
  
\* Gynoid equipment is only equippable by gynoids now (anyone else who equips it becomes invisible)
  
- Power Claws are still equippable by both Gynoids and Deep Elves.
  
\* Fixed Gynoid rebuild schematics so that Broken Gynoid Spellswords are rebuilt as Gynoid Spellswords, not regular Gynoids
  
\* Fire Seeker will now only attack hostiles
  
\* Seekers will engage hostiles upon deployment
  
- they will not wait for you to attack; they will initiate combat as soon as they are deployed
  
\* Seekers now explode after 5 seconds even if they are not killed. The explosion affects you too! So don't deploy unless you're in combat
  
\* Helots now use Dwarven Warhammers
  
  
Ordinator Patch
  
\* Changed the name of the Magecrafter perk from Apprentice Magecrafter to Magecrafter
  
\* Noted clearly in the Magecrafer perks' description what Smithing and Enchantment skill level you need to unlock the next level.
  
  
0.9b RC 1.4
  
Main Mod
  
\* Increased the effectiveness and cost of all repair spells
  
\* Changed automaton overdrive FX to a red color
  
\* Aetherial Power Armor now also requires 1 Aetherial Fuel Rod to be built
  
\* Deathwing Tempests now also require 1 Aetherial Fuel Rod to be built
  
\* Aetherial Fuel Rod added to leveled lists - 10% drop rate from dwarven boss chests
  
\* added powered dwarven weapons to leveled lists - 50% chance from boss chests and 30% from large chests
  
\* added 1 guaranteed Aetherial Fuel Rod drop to the Timelost Juggernaut, who is wearing Aetherial Powered Armor. 
  
- he can be found at the Mzulft Aedrome during the Revealing the Unseen quest
  
- you will probably need to choose whether to loot his power armor or the fuel rod if you don't have enough inventory space
  
\* increased weight of Aetherial Power Armor to 250
  
\* reduced damage of Aetherial Warhammer 
  
\* powered weapons, the Aetherial Powered Warhammer, Praetorians, and Ballistae now properly ignore armor
  
\* Removed Deep Elf/Deep Elf Vampire requirement to unlock the Magecrafter perk
  
- now, non-Deep Elf characters can access the tree
  
- Magecrafter lvl 1 still requires Dwarven Smithing, though
  
\* Added a two-handed version of the Aetherial Warhammer
  
- it can be converted back and forth between the 1H and 2H version for free
  
  
Extra Automatons Plugin
  
\* Adds four additional craftable automatons: the Balespider, Bolt Spider, Drakon, and the Colossus.
  
- requires Skyrim Immersive Creatures and Mihail Dwarven Colossus 
  
  
0.9b RC 1.5
  
Main Mod
  
\* Added two additional and increasingly powerful tiers of Dwarven Seekers: Volatile Seekers and Advanced Seekers. Higher tiers do more damage and have a higher blast radius. 
  
- Volatile Seekers require Magecrafter level 3
  
- Advanced Seekers require Magecrafter level 4
  
\* All Seekers now require some kind of soul gem to assemble. See the Automaton Crafting Guide in the documentation for the required materials. Or just check ingame.
  
\* Observers now require 1 Common Soul Gem to construct now, rather than 3 Common Soul Gems
  
\* Fixed Armatus 11 and 12's Relationship, which previously prevented them from being followers as they were not classified as allies to the player. 
  
\* Infernal Centurions are a little shorter now. 
  
  
Extra Automatons Plugin
  
\* Bolt Spiders now prefer ranged combat, and will hang back and shoot their crossbow
  
  
0.9b RC 1.6
  
Main Mod
  
\* Added a yellowish, chimeri-looking skin color for the immersionologists who'll probably complain about how dwemer aren't supposed to look like drow
  
\* Replaced the fourth skin color option with a bronze color
  
\* Drakaines no longer disappear/become invisible when killed - you can see their corpses now
  
\* Renamed several scripts to provide compatibility with TheBlackknight3000's mods  
  
\* Added a faction check to the Store Automaton option that requires you to dismiss an automaton follower before storing them
  
- previously, storing an automaton follower without dismissing it first resulted in the automaton being stored while still taking up a follower slot
  
- this is no longer possible as the Store option will not be displayed unless have been dismissed
  
\* Added a debug notification that warns players to clear their gynoid's/armatus'/packhorse's inventory AND dismiss them BEFORE storing them
  
\* Corrected some timeline inconsistencies in the documentation and in the mod text
  
\* NPC's will no longer think you're naked if you're wearing power armor
  
\* Updated the starting books so that they reflect the new revisions to the documentation
  
\* Added Dwarven Jump Charges
  
- craft Dwarven Jump Charges to rapidly recharge an inert automaton to its primed state 
  
- they function as 'scrolls', and are consumed when used
  
\* Added the Recall Automaton and Mark Automaton spells
  
\* Fixed Warp Cores so they don't interrupt Time Warp anymore
  
  
Extra Automatons Plugin
  
\* Changed the Armatus model so it doesn't use the goofy looking one that clips through its own body
  
  
Follower Plugin
  
\* Changed Ashtaret's face complexion to make her look younger (MARRY HER! lol) 
  
\* Nizrok is no longer marriable to stay consistent with his background story 
  
\* Nizrok can wear power armor
  
  
Main Mod Changelogs
  
Spoiler

Initial Release
  
  
[Version 1.01 Reuploaded]
  
\* Added optional difficulty modes that nerf/remove the Maleficarum Curse. ONLY WORKS ON NEW GAMES.
  
\* Fixed Gravity Bomb so it doesn't cancel out Slow Time and end its effects early

\* Packhorses aggression level changed from Very Aggressive to Aggressive, making it so that they only run away from hostiles
  
\* Primed Helot containment spheres spawn Helots now
  
\* Excluded all craftable automatons from the effects of The Calling 
  
- casting The Calling near your automatons will not bug them out anymore.
  
  
SSE Only
  
\* Fixed formatting on the Animunculi Maintenance book so it doesn't bug out on SSE
  
\* Fixed the text-squishing in the Animunculus Maintenance handbook
  
  
Extra Automatons Plugin SSE
  
\* Fixed Armatus deployment CTD
  
- fixed by reverting Armatus model to the one it uses when SIC is installed
  
  
[Version 1.011]
  
\* Fixed Warp Core scaling so it scales your Time Warp attack speed too, not just slow time
  
  
[Version 1.02 Reuploaded]
  
WARNING PLEASE READ: 
  
You MUST follow this updating procedure:
  
\* Go to your spellbook and equip the 'Debug - Unmark All Automatons' spell
  
\* Aim at a crafted automaton and cast it (does not work on Armati, Gynoids, or Packhorses)
  
\* You should see on the top left a notification that says: "All automatons unmarked."
  
\* You can now proceed to remark your automatons for teleportation.
  
  
Changelog:
  
\* Dwemer beards shouldn't stretch anymore
  
\* Fixed HDT Gynoids. Gynoids will have body physics if you install HDT Gynoids
  
\* Added a debug spell that removes all autos from the teleportation formlist - dead or alive
  
\* Added a script that removes autos from the automaton teleportation formlist when they are killed
  
- This makes it so that you can no longer teleport dead automatons. Teleporting dead autos would make their remains unrecoverable. My bugfix prevents this.
  
\* Mark Automaton only works on living autos
  
\* Mark Automaton no longer affects Gynoids, Armati, and Packhorses. YOu don't need to teleport them because they are followers and are programmed to teleport to you if you get too far away anyway
  
\* Fixed Powered Battle Axe 1st-person model so it's an axe, not a hammer
  
\* Removed the skill level requirement from the Aetherial Power Armor and Warhammer
  
- you can craft it right after obtaining Magecrafter level 4 now
  
\* Aetherial Powered Warhammer 'conversion' schematics only show up in the forge when you have an Aetherial Powered Warhammer in your inventory
  
- FYI: you can convert Aetherial Powered Warhammers between 1-handed and 2-handed versions whenever you want at a forge
  
\* Removed sound fx from all powered weapons because they were really stupidly loud and annoyingly inconsistent 
  
  
[Version 1.03b]
  
Changelog:
  
\* If updating from 1.02 to 1.03, you MUST follow the STANDARD UPDATING PROCEDURE after installing. See the Updating Guide in the Installation section of the mod description for instructions on how to properly update your game. The new features in this mod will not work unless you follow the Standard Updating Procedure.
  
  
Power Scaling
  
\* Chronokinetic powers now scale to your level, to make them less overpowered and more challenging to use up to level 100 (past that, scaling stops entirely)

- The damage that Warp Jump inflict upon you increase by about 0.6 per level

- I found out that it happens when you aim Warp Jump at a live NPC

\* Each Atronach Cube increases magic resistance by an additional 5%, up to 35%

- Replaces Animunculi perks with Magecrafter perks
  
- Replaces Mass Production with High Explosives (equivalent to Dwarven Explosive Studies which unlocks Seekers and explosive bolts and arrows)
  
\* This patch is only required if you are using the Warrior Module, which makes changes to the Smithing Tree
  
- if you do not use PerMa's Warrior Module, then you DO NOT need this patch

\* Added Assault Jump power, which is the same as Warp Jump, except it breaks stealth and knocks down nearby targets
  
- acquired by equipping Warp Cores
  
\* Warp Cores
  
- weight changed from 50 to 1
  
- Warp Core now takes up Slot 54 in order to provide compatibility with the Dwarven Goggles/Scouter Mod
  
- gives players the Assault Jump power
  
- Warp Cores also increase the duration of the damage buffs that Time Dilation gives you
  
\* Warp Jump
  
- Jump no longer breaks stealth (YAAAAY!!!!) 
  
- just don't Warp Jump so close that you touch an NPC, or they will be alerted by your presence
  
- Warp Jump's description updated to say that it deals light damage
  
\* Time Dilation
  
- Time Dilation now slows time to a near standstill (in the same way that Time Warp does)
  
- its duration has been incerased by 1 second
  
- it also increases all damage done by 10% while active 
  
- Time Dilation's description updated to say that it deals moderate damage
  
\* Dwarven Automatons
  
- The Tempest's Tempest Strike ability now does Shock damage, instead of Frost damage
  
  
Ordinator Patch
  
\* Dwarven Explosive Studies requires Magecrafter level 2 now
  
  
[Version 1.032b]
  
IF YOU ARE ALREADY PLAYING A DWEMER VAMPIRE, YOU MUST ROLL BACK TO A PREVIOUS SAVE BEFORE YOU GOT INFECTED, AND RE-INFECT YOURSELF. That, or start a new vampire character via Alternate Start. If you do not do this, vampirism will not work properly. You could also try setting your race to 11DeepElfRaceVampire3, but that might not work well.
  
  
Almost every single optional patch and plugin for this mod has been updated to accomodate the latest Deep Elf Vampire race fix. Make sure to check every plugin/patch you had installed in previous versions when installing 1.032b
  
  
Main Mod
  
\* Deep Elf Vampires and Werewolves should now be playable
  
- The fix to the "I'm a werewolf, and when I reverted back to my humanoid form and became a vampire" bug only works on new saves... a work-around/fix for that is coming soon in the next update
  
﻿- mod is now compatible with, and should work well with vanilla vampirism, Better Vampires, and Sacrosanct
  
- your eye color should not change when you become a vampire
  
- you should obtain all the starting vampire abilities when you become a vampire
  
﻿﻿- PLEASE REPORT ANY BUGS!!!!
  
\* Flameswords should be able to equip Gynoid equipment now
  
\* Ballistae shouldn't engage all nearby NPC's anymore
  
- their aggression was set to unaggressive, so they should only attack in self-defense or when you attack
  
\* Assault Jump's detonation radius increased to 400, and force increased to 450
  
- knockdown radius is basically quite larger, and enemies should get ragdolled a bit
  
\* Disabled Gynoid Cape 1 because its mesh is bugged and I don't know how to fix it
  
  
SSE
  
\* Fixed book 'melding' in The Animunculariary book 
  
  
Optional Plugins
  
\* Deep Elf Followers plugin updated 
  
\* Ordinator Patch updated
  
\* Perkus Maximus Patch updated
  
\* Sacrosanct Patch updated 
  
\* SPERG Patch updated
  
\* SOS - Deep Elf Addon updated
  
  
\* New plugin: Better Vampire Lord Transformation - Deep Elf Edition
  
- this will change female vampire lords so that they use female deep elf appearances
  
- NOTE: Installing this plugin will change the appearance of ALL female vampire lords, whether they are of nordic, dark elven, etc origin. All vampire lords will look like female deep elves.
  
  
[Version 1.0321b]
  
It seems as though the werewolf fix in 1.032 only works on new saves, so users who started playing dwemer werewolves pre-1.032 may experience different results from the new patch when they revert from Beast Form. Some users report being turned into vampires upon reverting, while others report that 1.032 fixes this bug.
  
  
However, I've devised a workaround for this bug for pre-1.032 dwemer werewolves: the Dwemer Werewolf Fix item (yes, such an inspired name)
  
  
\* Added Dwemer Werewolf Fix item
  
- when equipped before entering Beast Form, this item will change you back to the proper Deep Elf race when you change back. 
  
- Obtain this item by entering the console with tilde ~ and typing in: help "dwemer werewolf fix" (with quotes) and add the item to your inventory with player.additem \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 1 (where the blank is the item's code) 
  
- basically, when the game re-equips all your items after reverting from Beast Form, this item will set your race to Deep Elf race 
  
- this item also sets your race to the Deep Elf race when it's equipped in general
  
- DO NOT USE THIS ITEM IF YOU ARE A DWEMER VAMPIRE!!!!!! If you equip this as a Dwemer Vampire, you will be changed to the default Deep Elf race!
  
\* gave Warp Core a proper armor addon in the CK 
  
\* Reduced the weight of the Chronokinetic Stabilizer to 10
  
\* cleaned main Deep\_Elf\_Race plugin and Follower Plugin
  
  
[Version 1.0322b]
  
\* Time Dilation now increases combat skills by 50%, rather than 20% (this results in a more noticeable damage boost)
  
\* Added Aetherium Fuel Rods in notable locations in the world: 2 in Blackreach, and 1 in the Aetherium Forge. Additionally, as a reminder, you can get one from Mzulft by defeating the Timelost Juggernaut.
  
\* Removed the Nevernude body option. If you want to use vanilla bodies that aren't nude, either install the CBBE or UNP version. FYI: body textures are NOT what makes your characters nude: it is the body MESHES. Whether you install the UNP or CBBE textures doesn't matter - if you do not have any body mesh mods installed (in other words, if you are playing vanilla Skyrim), your character will not be nude no matter what textures you are using. 
  
- TL;DR both CBBE and UNP body textures will work with vanilla bodies
  
\* Fixed knee gaps in Armati legs when they equip armor. 
  
\* Changed the name of the Timeshifting debuff to Corporal Distortion
  
\* Reduced the damage that Warp Jump and Assault Jump do to you by 10%
  
\* End Time is now a castable power - you have to charge it up in one or both hands to use it.
  
\* End Time ignores line of sight and all magical resistances (not that it could really be resisted anyway seeing as it instant kills things...)
  
\* Removed effects from Maleficarum duplicate (Unerring Materialism?) ability that may have been added to players in previous patches
  
  
[Version 1.033b]
  
\* Added Void Grip power to dwemer vampires
  
- paralyzes and applies a DoT to your target, dealing a ton of damage that scales to your level.
  
\* Added Aesthetic Elves Patch
  
\* Removed Ethereal Elven Overhaul as a requirement for the mod (it is optional again)
  
\* Included RaceCompatibility in the installer to make installation easier
  
\* Updated installation guide
  
\* Please read the installation guide when updating...
  
\* Also FYI: if you installed the BVLT Plugin, load it after your vampire mods or close to the bottom of your plugin order or it won’t work. Forgot to mention that.
  
\* Changed sound effects of the End Time power
  
  
[Version 1.034b]
  
\* You can now upgrade your Atronach Cubes and Warp Cores to the next tier for about half the material cost (e.g. Lesser Atro Cube can be upgraded to an Atro Cube)
  
- this will make it easier to obtain the Dwarven power-boost items
  
\* Resolved 2 NULL errors in TESV5Edit 
  
\* Chronokinetic Stabilizer now nullifies Time Warp damage
  
\* Power Armor now counts as a full set of armor, so it benefits from full-set perks
  
\* Integrated and tweaked Automatic Crossbows mod 
  
- NOTE: rate of fire may vary due to script lag
  
- Autocrossbow - Automatic crossbow that holds 30 bolts per magazine 
  
- Manuscorpio - Semiautomatic crossbow that fires bolts that ignore 100% of a target's armor; holds 8 bolts per magazine
  
- Multiballista - Burst-fire crossbow that fires 3 bolts per trigger pull; holds 15 bolts per magazine
  
\* Void Grip is now a Destruction spell and can be casted repeatedly
  
- its magicka cost is high (about 80 MP at level 1), and it scales with your level up to level 100
  
\* Time Dilation now costs less HP and more MP to cast
  
- HP cost is now the same as Warp Jump (14.5)
  
- Base MP cost at level 1 is 18 magicka 
  
- Time Dilation also specifically increases damage of bows by 100% 
  
- other weapon skills as well as the Destruction skill are increased by 50%
  
- I did this to make Time Dilation more useful, and to encourage players to use it constantly in battle rather than only at decisive moments
  
\* Time Warp increases weapon skills and the Destruction skill by 25%
  
- I found that Time Warp was less effective at higher levels, so I added a damage increase to compensate for this
  
\* Gravity Bomb now ignores line of sight, so it will knockback and affect everyone around you no matter were they are standing (whether they are behind a wall, or a chair)
  
- Because of this, Gravity Bomb now RELIABLY knocksback and affects your enemies (sometime enemies wouldn't be affected because they were standing behind a blade of grass or something stupid)
  
\* Both Time Dilation and Warp Jump increase your armor rating significantly for a few seconds after the spells' effects wear off to make the spells less punishing if miscasted or used at the wrong moment
  
- Time Dilation inreases armor rating by 50% for about 1.5 seconds after it is casted
  
- Warp Jump and Assault Jump increase armor rating by 100% for about 2 seconds after either is casted
  
\* Chronokinesis spells no longer make your character go 'oof' everytime you cast them (they are flagged as 'painless' so that you don't bleed/cry out when you're hurt by them)
  
\* Doubled the projectile speed of Void Grip (it is now 5000)
  
  
[Version 1.04]
  
You must do the Standard Updating Procedure if updating from 1.034b to 1.04!!! See the Installation>Updating section in the mod description for instructions.
  
  
Major changes to Power Armor operation... please read the changelog or documentation!!!
  
  
New patch!
  
Vokrii Patch
  
\* Renames Dwarven Smithing perk to Dwarven Magecrafting 
  
- Dwarven Magecrafting level 0 (first one you unlock) unlocks Dwarven weapons and armor
  
- Level 1-4 unlocks the Magecrafting perks
  
- Level 3 unlocks Dwarven Explosive Studies (Seekers, etc) as well
  
  
Main Mod
  
\* Fixed Automaton Overdrive so that it is actually usable now (previously, the Magecrafter perks weren't adding it to players' spellbooks because it didn't belong to a magic skill)
  
- players who start a new game should receieve the spell automatically or after unlocking Magecrafter
  
- players who are updating will need to do the following to obtain the spell:
  
- enter the console and type: help "Spell Tome: Automaton Overdrive" . The console will then tell you spell tome's item id (xx9A795) the first two digits (xx) will be different from user to user
  
- type player.additem \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and type in the item id, then press enter. Overdrive's spell tome will spawn in your inventory and you can read it 
  
\* Non-dwemer players can now mark and recall automatons, as the spells are now added by unlocking Magecrafter level 1
  
\* Added 5 character presets for each sex 
  
\* Consolidated the different tiers of repair automaton and overdrive spells into single spells
  
- removed Repair Auto tiers 2 and 3, removed Restore Auto tier 2, and removed Overdrive tiers 2 and 2.
  
\* The strength and magicka cost of automaton repair and Overdrive spells are increased by each Magecrafter perk you unlock
  
- See the documentation for more info on how the repair spells are buffed 
  
\* Tweaked and (tried) to balance the repair automaton spells
  
\* Obsolete repair and overdrive spells are hidden from players now
  
\* End Time now uses the Master-level ritual spell animations
  
- requires both hands to cast, and you will be immobilized while charging it up
  
- you will only be able to aim wherever you started casting (you can only aim up and down, not left and right) so aim first then cast!
  
\* Rewrote some perk and item descriptions across all perk patches and the base mod
  
\* Hid Magecrafter magic effects
  
\* Added sound effects to the following spells:
  
- Gravity Bomb
  
\* Renamed Ancient and Legendary Atronach Cubes to Chromatic and Timelost Atronach Cubes, respectively 
  
\* Corrected some typos in item descriptions
  
\* Added an Aetherium Fuel Rod to Nchuand Zel Control
  
  
Power Armor
  
\* Added several Power Armor Lockers to the world
  
- Locations: Nchuand Zel Armory, Blackreach War Quarters, Arkngthamz 
  
- Not all of them have power armor in them...
  
\* Power Armor now needs the following two things to be operable:
  
- At least 1 Aetherial Fuel Rod in your inventory
  
- Power Armor Training
  
\* Power Armor Training is no longer unlocked instantly after unlocking Magecrafter 4, it must now by learned from a book
  
- Two copies can be found in the Reachwind Eyrie and in the College of Winterhold Arcanaeum
  
\* Aetherial Power Armor no longer occupies the Circlet slot, meaning you can now use circlets (like the Aetherial Crown) with power armor
  
  
Main Mod - SSE
  
\* Most Timelost Dwemer items (Warp Core, Chrono Stabilizer, etc) should preview properly in the item menu (except power armor and aetherial warhammer... can't figure out how to fix those)
  
  
[Version 1.041]
  
New Plugin:
  
Carry Weight Patch
  
\* Increases carry weight of Werewolves and Vampire Lords so that they don't get encumbered when your Tesseract Cubes are unequipped while transforming
  
  
Main Mod
  
\* I forgot to convert Deep\_Elf\_Race.esp to and .esm in the Oldrim version, so none of the changes in 1.04 carried over into the main mod... this is fixed. 
  
- (I'm debating whether or not I should drop development for Oldrim, since it's such a hassle to port it back and forth between updates...)
  
\* Corrected some typos in the Atronach Cube line of items. Their descriptions should accurately describe your magicka regen rate now when equipped
  
\* Hid Time Warp buffs from the UI, because there's a ton of them 
  
\* Fixed some ITM errors in the Deep\_Elf\_Race.esm
  
  
BVLT Plugin
  
\* Applied the Vampire Lord carry weight fix from the main mod to the BVLT Plugin - therefore, if you load the BVLT plugin at the bottom of your plugin list (as instructed in the installation guide) you should have infinite carry weight as a vamp lord 
  
- this should prevent encumberance when using a tesseract cube while a vampire 
  
  
[Version 1.042]
  
  
New Plugins:
  
Wildcat Patch
  
\* Makes chrono abilities less damaging to players, since Wildcat amplifies chrono-damage to insane degrees
  
  
Vokriinator Patch (SSE only)
  
\* Adds skill tree compatibility for Vokriinator
  
  
Main Mod
  
\* Primed, Inert, and Broken Ballistae have an inventory model now
  
\* Multiballistae can now be crafted at Magecrafter 2
  
\* Exploding Dwarven Arrows should have projectile models now
  
\* Animunculi followers cannot be teleported via Recall Automaton anymore
  
- they are excluded to prevent waiting animunculi followers from teleporting to your location when Recall Automaton is used
  
- Animunculi followers teleport to you on their own, anyway
  
\* Skin tone of femdwemer preset 3 changed to brown
  
\* Removed unintended record changes to DLC2KagrumezLvlDwarvenBallistaFight1
  
\* Power Armor Training Manual should be interactable/usable/readable now
  
- For future reference: they can be found in power armor lockers (randomly), but they are set to spawn in the Reachwind Eyrie and Winterhold College's Arcanaeum. 
  
  
Followers Plugin
  
\* Updated Ash's face to match my version's more refined model
  
  
[Version 1.043]
  
  
Main Mod
  
\* Fixed a bug that was causing a CTD when Armati, Spheres, (and possibly) Centurions are deployed
  
- I think I fixed this in 1.01/1.02, but it showed up again while I was making 1.043. Not sure if the bug was active in 1.03/1.04 patches, but there ya go: it's fixed
  
  
Revamped Observers!
  
\* ATTENTION! In order to use the revamped Observers, you must dispose of any Observers or Observer containment spheres you have. 
  
- You can dispose of them by disabling them in the console
  
- Only newly-crafted Observers will have the new behaviors and abilities below
  
\* Observers now have a Cloaking ability that renders them invisible upon entering combat for 10 seconds
  
- This allows them to close in on enemy spellcasters while invisible
  
- Upon attacking a hostile, they will become visible again
  
- This Cloaking ability refreshes at the end of combat, allowing them to cloak once more in the next encounter
  
\* Observers also pursue enemies in combat now (they couldn't before, for some unknown reason that I magically fixed)
  
  
Improved Gynoids!
  
\* Gynoids (excluding the Spellsword models) have new perks to make them a viable option along with the newly-improved spellswords:
  
- Critical Shot (15% chance of a critical hit that does 25% more critical damage.)
  
- Improved Quick Shot (Can draw a bow 50% faster.)
  
\* Gynoids (excluding the spellsword models) now cloak themselves upon entering combat for 10 seconds
  
- Cloaking is disabled when they attack
  
\* Regular Gynoid models now have the following perks:
  
- Critical Shot (15% chance of a critical hit that does 25% more critical damage)
  
- Quick Shot (Can draw bows 50% faster (20% faster than players with the normal Quick Shot perk))
  
  
General Animunculi
  
\* Crested Armata helm texture changed so that it uses whatever textures you have installed
  
\* Gave animunculi accurate damage resistance values ingame:
  
- Armati resist 20% damage now (without a full set of Armatus armor)
  
- Helots resist 20% damage now
  
- Gynoids resist 20% damage (without a full set of Gynoid armor)
  
- Centurions resist 60% damage
  
- Striders resist 40% damage
  
- Praetorians resist 35% damage
  
- Infernals resist 80% damage
  
- Tyrants resist 15% damage
  
- Venatores resist 10% damage
  
- Colossi resist 80% damage
  
- Drakontes resist 30% damage
  
\* Jump Charges for Colossi, Bale Spiders, Bolt Spiders, and Drakontes require glass as an ingredient
  
\* Gynoid Spellswords, Drakontes, Drakainas, Tempests, Witchslayers, and Deathwings now have Flame/Lightning Cloak powers that damage enemies in melee range
  
\* Schematics for Spiders, Spheres, Colossi, Bale Spiders, Bolt Spiders, and Drakontes now only appear in the smithing menu if you have at least 1 Containment Sphere in your inventory
  
\* Reduced movement speed of Armati and Gynoid models to 100, so they don't zoom around like Sonic anymore
  
\* Observers and Flayers now require Lesser Soul Gems to assemble
  
- hopefully this makes people use them more, since Lesser Soul Gems are easy to obtain
  
\* Drakons, Balespiders, and Bolt Spiders are now interactable (meaning you can see their names and stuff ingame)
  
  
Chronokinesis
  
\* Warp Jump now muffles your movement for 3 seconds, as well as increasing your Sneak by 15 points
  
  
[Version 1.043b]
  
  
Main Mod
  
Plugin Dependencies and Error-fixes
  
\* Removed USLEEP and USSEP dependencies from the Oldrim and SSE versions, respectively
  
- removed USLEEP and USSEP dependencies from all of my optional plugins
  
- I did this in case anymore USLEEP/USSEP-related shennanigans occur (if you know, then you know). This might also make my mod usable on VR?
  
- this also makes porting my updates to SSE easier because I don't have to rename master dependencies during the porting process...
  
\* Cleaned all of my optional plugins
  
\* Removed some useless errors from the main plugin
  
- did this by replacing missing Critical Effect with a Dummy spell
  
- straight up just removed some armors that had errors
  
  
[Version 1.05]
  
  
Main Mod

Animunculus Armors
  
\* Tweaked Armatus armor set
  
- new armor ratings for set pieces (AR = armor rating; DR = damage resistance):
  
- Boots 55 AR
  
- Cuirass 90 AR
  
- Gauntlets 35 AR 
  
- Gynoid armor is classified as Light Armor now
  
- new armor ratings for set pieces (AR = armor value; DR = damage resistance):
  
- Helm 30 AR 
  
- Shield 40 AR
  
- 210 AR in total (without shield) 30% total DR
  
- 250 AR in total (with shield) for 35% total DR

- 140 AR in total (without pauldrons, and using hair + faceplate instead of helm) for 20% total DR
  
- 175 AR in total (with pauldrons, and using helm instead of hair + faceplate) for 25% total DR
  
  
Animunculi
  
\* Dwarven Seekers now require explosive powder to assemble, instead of Fire/Frost/Void Salts - this will make Seekers easier to make because they now require more common materials
  
- Fire Seekers require Pyrocrixic Powder
  
- Frost Seekers require Cryocrixic Powder
  
- Storm Seekers require Astrocrixic Powder
  
\* All three varieties of Explosive Powders require Dwarven Oil and Bone Meal to craft at a Cooking Pot
  
\* Both of the Dwarven Venators' power attacks now have higher stagger multipliers, making them capable of hurling aside enemies like Tyrants can
  
\* Fixed typos in Deathwing Jump Charge
  
  
General
  
\* Warp Cores, Reverse Time Modules, and Chronokinetic Stabilizers use enchantments instead of scripts to apply their effects to players
  
- this  should guarantee that Warp Cores, RTM's, and Chrono Stabilizers will apply their effects to players even under laggy Papyrus conditions
  
\* Aetherial Power Armor renamed to Aetherial Dwemervamidium
  
\* Aetherial Dwemervamidia now count as a full set of armor, allowing it to benefit from dwarven armor set perks
  
\* Salmon now yield 20 units of Dwarven Oil at Cooking Pots
  
  
Ammo
  
\* Explosive Bolts and Arrows now require explosive powder to assemble
  
- 3 Pyro/Cryo/Astrocrixic Powder = 10 Explosive Bolts
  
\* Explosive Bolts and Arrows can still be crafted using salts
  
- 1 Fire/Frost/Void Salt = 30 Explosive Bolts
  
  
[Version 1.06]
  
  
Removed Power Armor Patch
  
- it is redundant, pointless, and if you installed it in the past, you should start a new game without it
  
- alternatively, if you don't want to do the above, I've provided the Dwarven Power Armor patch as a separate download on my mod's Nexus page
  
  
Main Mod
  
\* Added Detonate Seekers (only works on Remote Seekers)
  
-﻿﻿ if you have the Dwarven Explosive Studies perk, but you don't have the Detonate Seekers power in your spellbook, enter the console, and type in: help "detonate seekers" and type player.addspell \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and enter the ID of the Detonate Seekers spell
  
\* Added Remote Seekers that can be remote-detonated with the Detonate Seekers power which is added to your spellbook via the Dwarven Explosive Studies perk
  
\* Added Null Core(requires Magecrafter 4 and the Aetherium Forge to craft)
  
- Adds Null Lance and Attenuate powers
  
- Null Lance instantly vaporizes 150 points of a target's magicka, and slowing their movement speed to 50%
  
- Attenuation ceases all magicka regeneration of hostile NPC's within a 100 foot radius around you
  
- Null Lance can be used repeatedly, but costs magicka
  
- Attenuate costs no magicka, but must recharge after each use
  
- Both are best used in conjunction with one another to silence spellcasters
  
\* Added Stealth Generator (Requires Magecrafter 2+ to craft at any blacksmith forge)
  
- 3 increasingly powerful tiers
  
- each tier can be upgraded to the next one with about half the resources
  
- Adds the Active Camoflage lesser power that makes you invisible for 10 secconds, but drains 5 magicka for the effect's duration
  
- Cannot be used in combat
  
\* Null Cores and Stealth Generators use the same slot as the Reverse Time Module, so you can only choose one
  
\* Added Aetherial Ward to Aetherial Dwemervamidium (aka Power Armor)
  
- Absorbs up to a maximum of 250 magic damage for 10 seconds. Can only be used once every 2 minutes.
  
\* Players move 30% faster in power armor now
  
\* Removed the stomping sound power armor makes when you run in it
  
\* Drakaines now do AoE damage with their attacks
  
\* Powered weapons and both types of Aetherial Warhammers are now enchantable, after I removed their descriptions
  
- power weapons and aetherial warhammers still ignore 50% and 100% of enemy armor, respectively, despite the description being blank
  
- the auto crossbows still aren't enchantable (enchantments don't work on them, anyway)
  
\* Aetherial Warhammers now ignore 100% of enemy armor
  
\* Recall Automatons now ignores terrain, so you should be able to cast it in most places and summon your automatons on your first try
  
\* You can no longer disenchant power armor
  
\* Changed Void Grip's spellbook visuals
  
\* Most magical animunculi now explode violently when destroyed, knocking down or hurling away nearby NPC's
  
- doesn't do any direct damage, because I couldn't figure out how to exclude non-hostiles from explosion damage
  
  
Extra Automatons 
  
\* Colossi, Drakontes, and Balespiders explode as described above
  
  
[Version 1.07]
  
  
Main Mod
  
\* Removed the PlayerWerewolfChangeScript.pex from the installer, which should allow Moonlight Tales users to use their howl abilities and other werewolf stuff again
  
\* Implemented some resources from Dwarven Modular Automaton (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/96999?)
  
\* ADDED THE NECESSARY STEALTH PERKS TO MOST ANIMUNCULI SO THAT THEY DO NOT TRIGGER TRAPS! YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY
  
\* Recall Automaton is now a SELF-targeted spell, meaning it casts whether you're aiming somewhere or not
  
- this should, hypothetically, make Recall Autamaton work 100% of the time (it failed, often, in previous patches) but I haven't tested it thoroughly yet
  
\* Added 5 Faceplates (with glowing eyes and static expressions) to Gynoids
  
- New Gynoids start with a random faceplate 
  
- You can craft other faceplates and replace the one they start with for no resources
  
\* Added 3 Gynoid 'Crown' helmets which replace their hair 
  
- same stats as Strider Crown, but different appearances
  
\* Adjusted all Gynoid Blindfolds to fit new faceplates
  
- all blindfolds will look weird unless your gynoid has a faceplate equipped
  
\* All Gynoid Crowns are classified as light armor
  
\* Gynoids that have already been crafted and spawned will not have these new faceplates, and you will need to equip them with faceplates
  
\* All Power Armor now has a world model, which means you can drop it and pick it up
  
\* All other TLD devices, Aetherial Fuel Rods, and Colossal Aetherial Fuel Rods DO NOT have world models... SO DON'T DROP THEM
  
\* Observers now explode upon death, dealing magicka damage to nearby NPC's
  
\* Observers now produce Inert Observers when stored
  
\* Deathwing death explosions are now bigger and more violent, hurling enemies many feet away from the blast
  
\* Tier 3-4 automatons have new death explosion sounds
  
\* Adjusted Gynoid Pigtails to it doesn't cover one eye too much
  
\* Fixed equipment slots for Gynoid Centurion and Powered forearms
  
- they should appear on Gynoids when they are equiped now
  
  
Extra Automatons
  
\* Hostile colossi now resist 50% of all incoming damage
  
\* Added a hostile colossus in the Fahlbtharz Grand Hall
  
\* Colossus death explosions are just as powerful as Deathwing death explosions
  
\* The Forgemaster is now a colossus!
  
- This means that the Aetherium Forge battle will be a lot harder, and having a party of animunculi and followers is pretty much mandatory to overcome this boss
  
- The Forgemaster is also a lot tougher than the other colossi, as it takes 75% less damage from all sources
  
- The Forgeamster's death explosion is the same as the Colossus... except it does 100 damage to anything caught in its blast
  
\* Deconstructor Hammer now only drops from the Forgemaster 
  
\* Removed Calcemo's Colossus from the game because it's annoying as hell
  
  
[Version 1.08]
  
  
After two years of mod releases, I noticed that very few people play the Oldrim versions of my mods in comparison to the SSE versions.
  
  
Therefore, from this point onward, I will slowly discontinue support for Legendary Edition (Oldrim). I will still update the MAIN MODS and fix bugs as they're found, but I will no longer update or create PATCHES for Legendary Edition. Any requests to make patches or plugins for LE will be politely declined or ignored. 
  
  
I apologize for this decision, but I think it's for the best, as it cuts down on my work and lets me focus on modding the version of the game that I actually play. The SSE Creation Kit (when tweaked properly) is much faster, more efficient, and more optimized than LE's CK. 
  
  
Now that I'm migrating over to SSE, I can start work on my new mod: The Coldharbour Exile - A Xivkyn Race. TCE will be exclusive to SSE, and I will start working on it after I've wrapped up development for TLD. 
  
  
Main Mod
  
\* Added Tempered Males skin options: with undies, nude SOS, and nude SOS Light
  
\* Removed Power Armor patch from Oldrim installer 
  
\* Add Tempered Male Skins textures
  
\* Added Repair Spider 
  
- Has a repair aura that slowly heals nearby automatons for 5 health every 2 seconds 
  
- prefers ranged combat, will usually stand in the back and shoot rather than run into combat and die
  
- isn't particularly good at combat... it attacks at least every 3 seconds with a ranged shock attack that applies a minor damage over time effect
  
\* Added Repair Spider Jump Charge
  
\* Observers and Gynoids shouldn't spam invisibility in combat as much anymore 
  
\* Removed Aetherium Fuel rod from power armor's CRAFTING requirements
  
- YOU STILL NEED AN AETHERIUM FUEL ROD IN YOUR INVENTORY TO OPERATE IT
  
\* Made power armor description clearer. Moved all the stat info to the magic effects screen
  
- please don't ask me how to operate power armor anymore. It literally SAYS IT RIGHT THERE IN THE ITEM'S DESCRIPTION
  
\* Updated the "Assembling Animunculi" book so that it mentions that you need at least ONE Containment Sphere in your inventory in order for animunculi schematics to appear in your blacksmithing screen
  
\* Increased Ballista's bolt launcher projectile speed to 10000 (player ballistae only)
  
- this should make them hit things more consistently 
  
  
New Plugin: Timelost Dwemer Fertility Mode (SSE Only) 
  
\* Requires further testing: I haven't tested whether or not dwemer babies grow up into dwemer children yet, because it requires me to start a new game...
  
- spawning dwemer babies for sure works, though
  
\* Requires Fertility Mode SSE 
  
\* Pretty sure a decent number of people wanted this but were too ashamed to ask for it lmao
  
\* Allows female deep elves to get pregnant (including female deep elf players), and give birth to deep elven babies that grow up into children
  
\* Vampire children are still unsupported, but I will update the plugin when Narue adds vampire support to Fertility Mode
  
  
SOS and SOS Light Plugin (SSE)
  
\* converted plugins to form 44
  
\* Added Tempered Skins options for SOS and SOS Light
  
  
Follower Plugin (SSE Only)
  
\* Added Ashtaret's Dwarven Sentinel, Zara, House Namtara's family guardian 
  
- Ash will summon Zara once every 24 hours when she enters combat. Zara will accompany you until it is defeated. After 24 hours has passed since Zara's last summoning, Ash will resummon it again upon entering combat
  
- Zara resists 50% magic damage and 20% physical damage, has a 50% chance to absorb and completely negate magic damage entirely, and totally annihilates most enemies in close quarters combat, but does not have a lot of health compared to Ash or the player
  
\* Nizrok now, by default, wears his own version of power armor
  
- it confers about half the benefits that regular power armor has, but is still immensely powerful
  
- his power armor is invisible in his inventory, so you can't steal it >:DDDD
  
- once recruited, he will still be wearing his normal dwarven armor outfit, but if you take/add something to his inventory (like the hunting bow that the game adds to his inventory) then he will auto-equip his power armor
  
\* Both Ashtaret and Nizrok use a lesser version of Gravity Bomb with their standing power attacks, hurling away enemies within a 5 foot radius around them and applying a minor debuff that does damage over time
  
  
Extra Automatons (SSE Only)
  
\* Fixed 2 dirty edits related to Calcemo's deleted colossus and the Drakon Battleaxe 
  
\* Deconstructor Hammer now only drops from the Forgemaster (for sure this time lolz)
  
\* Bolt Spider prefers to attack with crossbow the majority of the time
  
\* Increased Ballista's bolt gun projectile speed to 10000 (player bolt spiders only)
  
  
[Version 1.081]
  
  
Main Mod
  
\* Changed Deep Elf race ActorProxy to Dark Elf
  
- this means that if you have RaceCompatibility - Dialog Changes (for Oldrim) or Race Compatibility Dialogue SSE installed, then NPC's will recognize you as a Dark Elf
  
\* REMOVED RACECOMPATIBILITY FROM INSTALLER
  
\* RC MUST BE INSTALLED SEPARATELY FROM THIS POINT ONWARD
  
  
[Version 1.082]
  
  
Main Mod
  
\* (Hopefully) removed all trace of RaceCompatibility from the installer
  
  
NEW Ancient Falmer + Timelost Dwemer Unified Fertility Mode Patch
  
\* Now that both my mods have Fertility Mode support, you will need this patch if you are playing with both the Ancient Falmer and Timelost Dwemer installed
  
\* You NEED this unified plugin if you want to use the TAF and TLD Fertility Mode plugins at the same time
  
  
Fertility Mode Plugin
  
\* Deep Elf Follower race added to list of races that can get pregnant
  
\* Unfortunately, the features in TLD Fertility Mode Plugin only work if you do a clean reinstall of Fertility Mode, or start a new game
  
﻿- I recommend you start a new game, but if you don't want to, here's how to clean reinstall Fertility Mode:
  
﻿﻿Instructions:
  
﻿ ﻿- Download and install [FallrimTools - Script Cleaner](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5031)
  
﻿﻿ ﻿- Open your mod manager and disable Fertility Mode and my TLD Fertility Mode Plugin (or remove TLD Fertility Mode from your merged patch, if you merged all my plugins)
  
﻿ ﻿﻿- Open Skyrim and load your save (you will be notified that the save is missing mods. Proceed anyway)
  
﻿ ﻿﻿- Save your game and exit 
  
﻿ ﻿﻿- Open the save you created with FallrimTools, remove all unattached instances, and resave the save game
  
﻿ ﻿﻿- Open Skyrim, load your save, and wait for Fertility Mode to load
  
﻿ ﻿﻿- Done: Fertility Mode should be 'updated' to detect both female dwemer players and female dwemer followers
  
\* Made the deep elf baby's skin lighter
  
\* Plugin now requires the Deep Elf Follower Plugin
  
\* Unique dwemer children
  
- the male and female dwemer children use dwemer eye colors now
  
- changed their hair colors to brown
  
  
Fertility Mode TKAA Patch
  
\* changed the hair styles and hair colors of both dwemer children
  
  
Deep Elf Follower Plugin
  
\* Updated Ash's face to look like my personal preset
  
  
Extra Automatons Plugin
  
\* Fixed a weird bug that removed Nizrok from the Follower Plugin
  
  
[Version 1.083]
  
  
Fertility Mode Plugin
  
\* Updated plugins for Fertility Mode v3.0+
  
- the plugins for Fertility Mode v2.9 and below are still included in the installer
  
\* If you are updating the Fertility Mode plugin for use with Fertility Mode 3.0+, you will need to do a clean reinstall of Fertility Mode, or start a new game
  
﻿- I recommend you start a new game, but if you don't want to, here's how to clean reinstall Fertility Mode:
  
﻿﻿Instructions:
  
﻿ ﻿- Download and install [FallrimTools - Script Cleaner](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5031)

﻿ ﻿﻿- Save your game and exit 
  
﻿ ﻿﻿- Open the save you created with FallrimTools, remove all unattached instances, and resave the save game
  
﻿ ﻿﻿- Open Skyrim, load your save, and wait for Fertility Mode to load
  
﻿ ﻿﻿- Done: Fertility Mode should be 'updated' to detect both female dwemer players and female dwemer followers
  
  
[Version 1.09]
  
  
Main Mod
  
\* New Advanced Aetherial Dwemervamidium!
  
- uses Mihail's new power armor model
  
- its Aetherial Ward absorbs up to 500 magic damage for 10 seconds, but takes 4 minutes to recharge
  
- players move normally while wearing advanced power armor (they aren't slow)
  
- resists 65% of incoming magic damage
  
- it reduces both Sneak and Lockpicking skills by 25 points (unlike the regular THICC power armor, which completely nullifies stealth skills)
  
- has a pair of Magic Missile launchers, granting players the Magic Missile A and Magic Missile B powers
  
- both launchers must be charged one at a time with their corresponging Charge spell, or their shots won't do damage 
  
\* Rebalanced Aetherial Dwemervamidium
  
- now confers 400 base armor
  
- nerfed its magic resistance from 65% to 45% 
  
\* Fixed Remote Seekers
  
- they will explode when you detonate them via the Detonate Seekers spell now (scripts were missing in previous versions)
  
\* Set Aetherium Power Armor's enchantment duration to 0 - this should astronomically-reduce the armor's sell value (not that you could sell it, anyway)
  
\* Corrected the basic Aetherial Ward tooltip
  
- it says that it absorbs 250 magic damage (the correct value) now instead of 500
  
\* The fact that I have more installation options for males and penises bothered the hell out of me, so I added two new sets of skins for female dwemer:
  
- Added Bijin female skins for CBBE and UNP users
  
- Added Fried's Nevernude CBBE and vanilla skins for females
  
\* Added Bijin CBBE and UNP skins for female dwemer
  
  
SOS Plugin
  
\* Added support for SOS Full's Muscular and Regular schlongs (with a Tempered Males version available on SSE)
  
\* The Deep Elf SOS plugin only supports one SOS schlong type. Cannot support all three - so pick the schlong you mainly use in the installation menu
  
  
Ordinator Patch
  
\* Updated to support Ordinator 9.30's changes to Auto Cannon friendly-fire damage
  
  
Followers Plugin
  
\* Ashtaret and Nizrok have secret treasures that players can find and equip them with 
  
- see their inventories for their newly-added journals/diaries that should give you a clue on where to find these treasures 
  
\* New follower: Ereshkiga 
  
- she can be found in the Nchuand-Zel Excavation Site
  
- Eresh is a sneak archer with active camo that lasts 60 seconds out of combat
  
- She comes equipped with a unique quick-draw bow, and several thousand high velocity dwarven arrows (they travel faster than regular arrows)
  
\* Moved Ashtaret to Arknthamz and Nizrok to the War Quarter, Blackreach
  
\* Fixed Nizrok's skin color: it now matches his face
  
\* Ash should now summon Zara in combat (scripts were missing in previous versions)
  
\* Reworked Ash's Zara guardian
  
- you must find Zara's Containment Sphere and give it to Ash (can be found on Zara's corpse in the Avanchnzel Animoncultory)
  
- once she equips it, she will be able to deploy Zara about a day after she equips it (due to my scripting limitations)
  
- she can only summon Zara once every 24 hours
  
- If Zara is killed, Ash will simply summon her again the next day when she enters combat
  
\* Reworked Nizrok's power armor
  
- Nizrok no longer spawns with his armor. It must be looted from Bthar-Zel (aka Deep Folk Crossing... it is under the bridge) Note: the power armor locker can only be opened with Nizrok's key
  
- Nizrok's power armor no longer requires a fuel rod
  
- Nizrok's power armor can be taken from his inventory, and it weighs nothing
  
- HOWEVER, the armor only functions when Nizrok wears it because he has an exclusive perk that the player cannot obtain by normal means
  
- trying to equip Nizrok's power armor will render players immobile
  
\* All dwemer followers are now the same height as the player
  
\* Eresh and Ash are both Brave and Aggressive, while Nizrok is Foolhardy and Aggressive
  
  
[Version 1.091]
  
  
Main Mod
  
\* MOST REQUESTED FEATURE ADDED: Harvesting your own blood for Discerning the Transmundane 
  
- Dwemer players can now click on the Essence Harvester to harvest their own dwemeric blood and quickly complete Septimus's blood sample quest
  
\* Finally fixed Gynoid dresses with body-fitting meshes 
  
\* Updated the body shape of Gynoids, Drakaines, Striders, and Tempests 
  
  
SSE Only:
  
  
Vokriinator Black (new)
  
\* Added Vokriinator Black Patch
  
- largely untested; I don't care enough to dig through VK Black, but preliminary tests suggest that my Magecrafter perks work. Please report any bugs, even though I probably won't get to it for another 6 months 
  
  
Follower Plugin
  
\* Updated Ash's face 
  
  
High Poly Head Patch (new)
  
\* Added Kboot's High Poly Head Patch which allows players to use VectorPlexus's high poly head meshes
  
  
[Version 1.1 Hotfix 1]
  
\* Added the correct Extra Automatons plugin to the installer, which conesquently removes Mihail's Colossus plugin from the mod (for sure  this time)
  
﻿- for more info, look directly below
  
  
[Version 1.1]
  
README: This update removes Mihail Colossus plugin from Extra Automatons requirements. This means  that the Mihail Colossus plugin (mihailesocenturion.esp) is no longer included by default in the Extra Automatons installation. 
  
  
This may have some consequences on your save file.
  
  
After updating, if Skyrim tells you that you are missing mihailesocenturion.esp when you load your save,you must install the Mihail Colossus plugin in my installer or you will get an error message the next time you load your save game. 
  
  
If you wish to proceed without mihailesocenturion.esp, then you must clean your save game with [Fallrim Tools](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5031). If you don't do this you might cause irreparable damage to your save game.
  
  
If you have been merging the Timelost Dwemer plugins together, then you shouldn't have to do any of the above. All you need to do is remove mihailesocenturion.esp from your merge. You might need to reinstall mihailesocenturion.esp to do this. 
  
  
Main Mod
  
\* Reworked End Time
  
- it uses the black hole visuals from Lertkrush's [Singularity](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38611)
  
- it no longer simply obliterates everything in a straight line in front of you, instead exploding at a target location and affecting everything in the 100 yard radius it hits with varying degrees of damage, ending with a final explosion that usually finishes off all remaining enemies
  
\* All repair skills have been reclassified as Alteration spells
  
\* Explosive steel ammo recipes unlocked with Magecrafter use crixic powders now
  
\* Removed all Magecrafter-related explosive ammo recipes that use elemental salts
  
- they are all crafted with crixics now
  
\* Crixic recipes produce 4 powders per build, now
  
\* Overhauled Seekers
  
- increased health of Seekers to 80 points
  
- Seekers are now deployed via throwable "grenade" scrolls
  
- I got the idea from TheBlackKnight3000's Aetherial Palace automatons :D
  
- Seekers no longer follow you around like normal automatons if they aren't in combat
  
- this protects you from being accidentally blown up by these little bastards
  
- Seeker recipes only produce 1 Seeker per build, now
  
- Seekers blast radius and damage increased
  
- Seekers now explode 3 seconds after death or deployment (remote seekers unchanged)
  
- Fixed Fire Seeker recipe so that it requires Pyrocrixic instead of Cryocrixic
  
- I didn't delete the obsolete Seekers containment spheres, so you'll still have them in your inventory 
  
\* Added 3 increasingly-powerful varieties of elemental hand grenades 
  
- includes Fire, Frost, and Storm varieties for both grenade types
  
- Grenade recipes yield 2 grenades per build
  
- Grenades are cheaper to make (don't require soul gems), have a smaller blast radius, and deal less damage than Seekers
  
- Grenades have a shorter fuse than Seekers (1.5 seconds)
  
\* Added 3 increasingly-powerful varieties of the 3 types of explosive dwarven arrows and bolts
  
- they all require crixic powders to craft
  
- they do less damage than grenades or seekers, but they are easier to craft and you can make 10 of them with one recipe
  
\* Automaton Overdrive duration increased to 60 seconds
  
\* Added ambient mechanical sounds to all dwarven automatons 
  
\* Every consructable automaton now has a chance to drop either a filled or empty soul gem if killed
  
- this should make repairing automatons easier 
  
  
funniguy12869's mesh fixes also included in this patch
  
\* Added physics to many droppable dwarven items and equipment added by this mod 
  
- does not include dwemer trinkets, or gynoid legs, shoulders, faceplates, or helmets
  
\* Aligned Gynoid capes to face the player in the inventory/crafting menu screen 
  
\* Fixed broken Gynoid Cape 1
  
  
Requiem Plugin by tarkanice9801
  
\* added basic Requiem patch
  
\* added Dragonborn Requiem patch
  
- requires both Requiem and Fozar's Requiem - Dragonborn Patch 
  
  
Follower Plugin 
  
\* added Relationship Dialogue Overhaul voice set patch that changes Ash and Nizrok's voice sets to use the highelfhaughty and commoner voices, respectively
  
  
Extra Automatons Plugin
  
\* Removed Calcemo's Colossus from Markarth once and for all
  
\* Increased Colossus follow distance 
  
  
[Version 1.101]
  
  
Main Mod
  
\* Added new versions of the vanilla beards that fit male Deep Elf faces
  
- this means that you do not need Ethereal Elven Overhaul to make beards work with my male Deep Elves anymore
  
\* Renamed Corporeal Distortion magic effect to Chronokinetic Feedback
  
  
SOS Addon
  
\* If you are using SOS Light, you must reinstall the Deep Elf SOS Addon
  
\* Fixed Tempered SOS Light textures 
  
- uses the right Deep Elf textures now
  
\* I moved some SOS Light assets between the main installer and the SOS installer. 
  
- If you are using SOS Light you must download and install the updated Deep Elf SOS Addon on Loverslab
  
  
New Adamant Patch!
  
\* Attached the Magecrafter series of perks to the Rare Styles perks
  
\* Attached the Dwarven Explosive Studies perk to the Weaponsmith perk
  
  
[Version 1.102]
  
  
Main Mod
  
\* Fixed Attenuation 
  
- it now ceases regeneration of hostile NPC's within 100 yards
  
\* Null Lance can now be casted several times, consecutively, without a cooldown 
  
\* Made several tweaks to The Calling
  
- longer affects targets in an area: it only affects the target you're aiming at 
  
- effect lasts 1 minute now
  
- mind-controlled automatons are destroyed after the effect wears off 
  
\* Atronach Cubes now increase magicka by +20 per tier
  
  
[Version 1.103]
  
Standard Updating Procedure required as a precaution for this update. See the mod's Nexus page's mod description Installation > Updating for instructions.
  
  
Upon loading a dwemer character, you will receive a Timelost Dwemer Starter Kit. It will give you original starter books when clicked, and they may be duplicates if you already have them.
  
  
This is normal.
  
  
Newly-created dwemer characters will NOT receive duplicate books. 
  
  
Main Mod
  
\* Fixed AddBooks scripts. It will no longer add duplicate books to your inventory
  
- it now adds 1 Timelost Dwemer Starter Kit to your inventory when you unlock the Magecrafter perk (in previous patches, AddBooks added all your books when you started the game, causing Papyrus to stutter and give duplicates)
  
- Clicking the Timelost Dwemer Starter Kit will add the starter items and the free dwemer spider to your inventory
  
\* Fixed the Animunculariary book's overlapping text bug
  
\* Added schematics to the Animunculus Schematics book 
  
- it now contains the recipes for all the animunculi in this mod, sorted by tier
  
\* Fixed Gynoid dress boob clipping 
  
- gynoid dresses should fit your gynoid's boobs now
  
\* Removed Full HDT Gynoid body from the installer
  
\* Partial HDT Gynoid ONLY has vulva physics now
  
\* Divided Partial HDT Gynoid body options into 2 options:
  
- Partial HDT CBBE Special Gynoid
  
- Partial HDT CBBE 3BBB Gynoid
  
- Use the correct body that corresponds to what you have installed
  
\* Partial HDT Gynoids now have flesh colored genitals, instead of the rubbery black color in previous updates
  
\* Gynoids are now the same height as female dwemer
  
  
[Version 1.104]
  
  
Main Mod
  
\* Mark Automaton is no longer needed 
  
- Automatons are automatically-marked for teleportation as soon as they are deployed 
  
  
Extra Automatons
  
\* Auto-Mark for Teleport script added to Extra Automatons units
  
  
[Version 1.104RE]
  
Mod Assets Were Restructured
  
Many assets were moved to separate patches at ["The Timelost Dwemer SE Patch Center"](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53412). See the notes below for more info.
  
  
Main Mod
  
\* All Timelost Dwemer skin textures were moved to ["The Timelost Dwemer - SKIN PATCHER"](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53412)
  
- if you do not install the SKIN PATCHER, your dwemer will use basic, edited, vanilla skin textures
  
  
\* BVLT patches were moved to ["The Timelost Dwemer - BVLT PATCHER"](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53412)
  
  
\* J3X's Auto Crossbow Resources were moved to ["The Timelost Dwemer - AUTO CROSSBOW SCRIPTS"](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53412) file
  
  
\* Completely removed Dwarven Mechanical Dragons assets from my mod, as I deemed them too risky to use (the mod author's permissions are a goddamn mess)
  
- thus, the Dwarven Deathwing will now, by default, use the VICN Resource Pack's Dwarven Dragon, which is much less impressive, but safer for me to use 
  
- HOWEVER, if you use the Extra Automatons Plugin, the plugin will swap the appearance of Dwarven Deathwings with their old model from Skyrim Immersive Creatures
  
  
\* Completely removed all Ethereal Elven Overhaul assets (the mod author's permissions are also a goddamn mess)
  
- consequently, I removed all the Ethereal Elven Overhaul beards that I added in 1.102. If your male dwemer was using them before the update, they will now be beardless upon installing this new update
  
- because of this, the Aesthetic Elves patch is no longer needed, and has been removed from installer
  
- both male and female dwemer will now use the default, vanilla headmorphs, and will consequently use whatever headmorphs you install. This should make my mod more compatible with head mesh mods
  
  
\* Removed the Aesthetic Elves Patch from my mod, as it is no longer needed
  
  
[Version 2.0]
  
  
Main Mod
  
Work on this patch spanned several months so I probably forgot to write down some of the changes, but the most important ones are written below:
  
  
\* Automaton deployment system COMPLETELY-OVERHAULED!!!
  
    - (Inspired by the automaton deployment system of Aetherial Palace Reborn, by TheBlackKnight3000!)
  
    - Automatons are now deployed via equippable "pokeball-style" Containment Spheres (classified as scrolls, in your inventory)
  
    - To deploy an automaton, you must equip one of the aforementioned spheres (scrolls) you crafted, and throw it. It will be deployed wherever the sphere lands.
  
    - All automatons that were crafted in previous patches can be converted to "pokeball-style" Containment Spheres for free
  
        - 1. Old automatons are classified as "Misc items". Drop one of these old misc-type primed automatons to deploy it
  
        - 2. Collect the automaton. It will be placed in your inventory as an inert automaton
  
        - 3. Reactivate the inert automaton at a blacksmith, and it will be converted into a throwable "pokeball" containment sphere
  
\* All player-built automatons now have 35% magic resistance
  
\* Dwarven Observers and Slayers now have improved magic resistance (75%)
  
\* Dwarven Observers now have improved movement speed (200) to catch those pesky cloth-wearing mages faster
  
\* Dwarven Tyrants will enter Berserker Mode when their health reaches 30%, decreasing incoming physical damage by a significant amount and increasing attack damage by 200% for 15 seconds. This effect does not stack and it cannot occur more than once every 2 minutes.
  
\* Buffed self-heal effect in Tyrants' melee attacks: normal attacks now heal 15HP, and power attacks heal 45-60HP
  
\* Repair Spider, Flame Sphere, and Storm Sphere storage fixed: they should yield their respective Inert forms when stored
  
\* Freed up equipment slots by changing the assigned slots of the equippable dwarven tech as follows:
  
    - Atronach Cubes now use Slot 61
  
    - Warp Cores now use Slot 48
  
    - Stealth Cores now use Slot 60
  
    - Tesseract Cube, Null Core, Reverse Time Module, and the Chronokinetic Stabilizer do not occupy an item slot when equipped
  
\* Removed Soul Gem requirements for Jump Charge schematics
  
    - This makes jump-starting inert automatons in the field more convenient
  
\* Added Mini Repair Kits, which can be crafted by breaking down 1 Small Repair Kit into 2 Mini Repair Kits
  
    - Mini Repair Kits are used to perform partial-repairs on Flayer and Observer Pods
  
\* Automatons that are deployed in pods/groups (Flayers and Observers) can now be partially-repaired, depending on how many inert and broken units you've collected
  
    - For example: if you have have 2 Inert Flayers and 1 Broken Flayer, you can use 1 Mini Repair Kit and 1 Lesser Soul Gem to repair the Broken Flayer, and combine it with the 2 Inert Flayers to make 1 Primed Flayer Pod
  
    - Another example: if you have 1 Inert Flayer and 2 Broken Flayers, you can use 2 Mini Repair Kits and 1 Lesser Soul Gem to repair the Broken Flayers, and combine it with the 1 Inert Flayer to make 1 Primed Flayer Pod
  
    - Last example: if you have 1 Inert Observer and 1 Broken Observer, you can use 1 Mini Repair Kit and 1 Lesser Soul Gem to repair the Broken Observer, and combine it with 1 Inert Observer to make 1 Primed Observer Pod
  
\* Flame Spheres, Storm Spheres, and Repair Spiders SHOULD now return Inert and Broken forms when stored, or if their remains are collected

[Version 2.1]
  
Main Mod
  
  
Automaton Deployment Overhaul [IMPORANT!!! PLEASE READ!!!]
  
\* Integrated TheBlackKnight's Automaton Deployment Overhaul
  
- Players may now issue commands to automatons via[Simply Order Summons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66919)﻿ and [Swiftly Order Squad - Simply Order Summons integration](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63259)
  
- Without [Simply Order Summons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66919) and [Swiftly Order Squad - Simply Order Summons integration](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63259), automatons will mostly function as they did originally in previous patches
  
﻿﻿﻿- HOWEVER: if you want to interact with your Armatus, Gynoid, or Packhorse, you MUST at the very least have the Simply Order Summons mod installed, or you will not have the option to trade with them or give them equipment to carry. 
  
  
\* Storing Automatons [IMPORANT!!! PLEASE READ!!!]
  
- Method 1: Use the "Store Automaton" or the "Store All Automatons" spells to return automatons (as inert) to your inventory 
  
- Method 2: If you're using Swiftly Order Squad + Simply Order Summons, speak to your automaton and dismiss them via dialogue to return them to your inventory 
  
- (the store automaton spells still work too)
  
  
﻿﻿\* Automaton Deployment Limit [IMPORANT!!! PLEASE READ!!!]
  
﻿﻿- Deep Elf players are limited to deploying 1 automaton at the start of the game
  
﻿﻿- Attempting to deploy a number of automatons beyond your Deployment Limit will send the last automaton you deployed back to your inventory
  
﻿﻿- You may expand your Deployment Limit by crafting and equipping Atronach Cubes
  
﻿﻿- The more advanced the Atronach Cube, the more automatons you will be able to deploy and maintain on the battlefield
  
  
﻿\* Observers no longer deploy 2 at a time
  
- you may still craft 2 at a time, and repair/reactivate up to 2 at a time at the blacksmith forge
  
\* Flayers no longer deploy 3 at a time 
  
- you may still craft 3 at a time, and repair/reactivate up to 3 at a time at the blacksmith forge
  
﻿﻿\* Magecrafter 4 reduces all automaton scroll weight to 0
  
﻿\* Automatons should now follow you through fast travel
  
- if they don't, then please install Swiftly Order Squad + Simply Order Summons, then teleport them to you via Swiftly Order Squad or Recall Automatons
  
  
Changes From Beta
  
\* Atronach Cubes no longer require Alteration skill to expand your Automaton Deployment Limit
  
- just build 'em and equip 'em and you're good to go
  
  
Various Fixes, Tweaks, and Additions
  
\* Added new Medi Spider (New!)
  
- heals 10HP per second 
  
\* Fixed the "Bound Weapons Disappearing at Level 45" bug, thanks to darkvador83's discovery in the Warp Jump scaling array
  
\* Gynoids now start with random outfit pieces. You can always craft new outfit pieces to replace or add to their outfit if you want. 
  
\* Armati now start with armor, and a random helmet
  
\* Armatus Shield and Helmets now requires Magecrafter 2 to craft (so it doesn't show up in the blacksmith UI unless you know how to craft armati)
  
\* Helots now start with random two-handed weapons
  
\* Gynoids and Armati now have new perks that make them stronger in combat
  
\* Deathwing Tempests no longer give dragon souls

- Should be good at silencing enemy spellcasters.
  
\* Stealth Generators no longer drain magicka when in use
  
  
Various Crafting Tweaks
  
I generally made many of the automatons and equipment easier to craft at earlier levels by removing uncommon ingredients from them. 
  
\* Armatus boots, cuirass, and gauntlets are no longer craftable, since Armati start with them anyway
  
- Armatus shields and helmets are still craftable, and may be created with Dwarven Shields and Dwarven Helmets, respectively
  
\* Drakainai require 8 Pyrokrixic, and 2 Fire Salts to craft now instead of 4
  
\* Drakontes require 4 Pyrokrixic, and 2 Fire Salts to craft now

\* The Advanced Dwemervamidium (Advanced Power Armor) requires 6 Void Salts to craft now instead of 6 to craft now 
  
- it costs 3 Void Salts to upgrade (rig) the regular Dwemervamidium to the Advanced Dwemervamidium
  
\* Tier 1 and 2 Warp Cores no longer require void salts to craft. Should make it easier to obtain. 
  
\* Tier 4 and 5 Atronach Cubes require 1 less elemental salt to upgrade to
  
\* Null Core needs 3 void salt to craft instead of 4
  
\* Tier 1 Stealth Generator no longer requires void salts to craft. Should make it easier to obtain.

Spider Mount Addon [Removed]
  
\* Removed as an installable option because it was merged with Extra Automatons 
  
\* If you are updating my mod during a game in progress and you need this plugin, please download it from my mod's Nexus page
  
  
Extra Automatons + Perkus Maximus Patch [Removed]
  
\* Removed entirely, because it is no longer needed. 
  
\* If you are updating my mod during a game in progress and you need this plugin, please download it from my mod's Nexus page
  
  
[Version 2.11]
  
Main Mod 
  
\* Removed wind up time for all elemental grenades
  
\* Added increasing Magecrafter requirements for all grenade recipes
  
\* Added increasing Magecrafter requirements for Volatile and Advanced explosive bolt and arrow ammo
  
\* Fixed Atronach Cube not increasing deployment limit, and causing automatons to not register as summoned units (making them incompatible with Simply Order Squad)
  
\* Fixed the Warp Core's soul gem requirement (needs a filled sg)
  
  
Extra Automatons 
  
\* Fixed Bolt Spider AI so that it prioritizes ranged combat again
  
  
[Version 2.11 Hotfix 1]
  
Main Mod
  
\* Dismissing Striders will return an Inert Strider to your inventory now instead of a primed strider 
  
\* Some housekeeping
  
  
[Version 2.11 Hotfix 2]
  
\* Reverted Armati, Gynoids, and Packhorses to 2.042 Follower versions 
  
- I did this because I realized that if Armati, Gynoids, and Packhorses die or are dismissed, then they instantly lose everything in their inventory
  
﻿﻿- Now, Armati, Gynoids, and Packhorses are regular followers again, not conjured/summoned NPC's
  
﻿﻿- this means they will not be unsummoned when they are slain. However, they will be unsummoned if you fully-dismiss them.
  
﻿- They are still manageable by Swiftly Order Squad and all other follower frameworks
  
﻿- Armati, Gynoids, and Packhorses must be RESET or you will encounter issues 
  
﻿﻿- RESET INSTRUCTIONS: 
  
﻿﻿﻿- First, remove everything from their inventory so their equipment doesn't get lost
  
﻿﻿﻿- Next, dismiss the automaton. This will return them to your inventory as INERT
  
﻿﻿﻿- Next, PRIME them at a blacksmith forge (just click on the priming recipe at a forge to re-prime)
  
﻿﻿﻿- Finally, deploy the PRIMED automaton as you normally would with the scroll, and transfer back all their equipment
  
﻿- Recruiting/Dismissing Armati, Gynoids, and Packhorses
  
﻿﻿- Since they're back to being regular followers again, they can only be returned to your inventory after dismissing them, and dismissing them a second time via their dialogue.
  
\* Removed starting equipment from Armati and Gynoids, and set the value of all Armartus and Gynoid equipment to 0 to prevent exploits
  
\* Added Heavy Dwarven Power Claws
  
\* Removed some recipes that don't belong in the mod anymore
  
  
[Version 2.11 Hotfix 3]
  
\* Restored the "Store Automaton" and "Collect Remains" dialogue options for Armati, Gynoids, and Packhorses
  
- You should be able to Store Armati, Gynoids, and Packhorses now (henceforth called "Follower Automatons" out of convenience), in the same way you could in version 2.042
  
- If you have any Follower Automatons from before 2.11 Hotfix 2, you NEED to RESET them first:
  
﻿﻿- RESET INSTRUCTIONS: 
  
﻿﻿﻿﻿- 1. remove everything from their inventory so their equipment doesn't get lost
  
﻿﻿﻿- 2. dismiss the automaton. This will return them to your inventory as INERT
  
﻿﻿﻿﻿- If there is no option to dismiss, then you may need to just kill them, and take all their equipment. Killing them via the console should return them to your inventory as inert. You will then have to reprime or rebuild the automaton, or spawn another deployment scroll via the console. 
  
﻿﻿﻿- 3. PRIME them at a blacksmith forge (just click on the priming recipe at a forge to re-prime)
  
﻿﻿﻿- 4. deploy the PRIMED automaton as you normally would with the scroll, and transfer back all their equipment
  
﻿- INSTRUCTIONS FOR RECRUITING FOLLOWER AUTOMATONS
  
- NOTE: You must recruit them as followers. Simply deploying them and letting them follow you around may cause them to get lost between loading screens.
  
- 1. DEPLOY them via their scroll item, if you haven't already.
  
- 2. ACTIVATE THEM. This will open a dialogue box that will say "Store Automaton" and "Talk"
  
- 3. SELECT "Talk". This will take you to the default follower NPC dialogue
  
- 4. SELECT "Follow me. I need your help." This will recruit them as a follower under your command. They can be managed via the vanilla follower system, Swiftly Order Squad, or any other follower framework.
  
- INSTRUCTIONS FOR STORING FOLLOWER AUTOMATONS  
  
- 1. sure to collect all their equipment and any items first
  
- 2. DISMISS them, if they are following you
  
- 3. ACTIVATE them. This will open a dialogue box that will say "Store Automaton" and "Talk"
  
- 4. SELECT "Store Automaton". This will return them to your inventory as an inert automaton.
  
\* Added Heavy Power Claws recipe lol
  
\* Some other small stuff I forgor
  
  
[Version 2.12]
  
Main Mod
  
  
Magecrafter Tweaks
  
\* Added final level to Magecrafter perk, Timelost Magecrafter (i.e. Magecrafter 5)
  
- requires Ench 100 and Smithing 100 to unlock
  
- replaces the skill requirements to build endgame TLD devices and the Colossus (i.e. the Colossus requires Magecrafter 5 to build now)
  
- this should make it clearer to users to figure out the requirements for the endgame craftable items without having to ask me in the mod comments 
  
- Null Core requires Magecrafter 5 to build now
  
- Tier 3 Warp Core and Tier 3 Stealth Generator require Magecrafter 4 to craftable
  
- Dwarven Colossus, Tier 5 Atronach Cube, Chronokinetic Stabilizer, Null Core, Reverse Time Module, Tesseract Cube, and Advanced Power Armor require Magecrafter 5 to craft now
  
\* Updated the contents of the following books to reflect Version 2.1:
  
- The Animunculariary, Assembling Animunculi and Animunculi Usage and Maintenance
  
\* Magecrafter perks now give you schematics books that list the components needed to build animunculi 
  
- e.g. Magecrafter 1 gives you "Magecrafter I - Animunculi Schematics", "Magecrafter 2 gives you Magecrafter II - Animunculi Schematics" etc.
  
- Explosive Studies perks and its equivalents (name may vary in the different perk overhauls), and Magecrafter 3 and Magecrafter 4 give you Explosives Schematics books
  
  
Automaton Upgrade System (New!)
  
\* Added upgraded variants of Gynoid, Stormswords, Flameswords, and Armati that gain enhanced stats, additional perks, and new abilities
  
- Gynoid Variata gains poison attacks and can sometimes avoid direct damage entirely 
  
- Stormsword Variata's Sparks spell is upgraded to Lightning Bolt, and now has a Lightning Cloak
  
- Flamesword Variata's Flames spell is upgraded to Firebolt, and now has a Flame Cloak
  
- Armatus Variatus gains a passive magic absorption field that has a 50% chance to absorb magic attacks.
  
  
Follower Automaton Tweaks
  
\* Armati now come wearing armor and a random Armatus Head, which means they don't spawn as dwemer metal skeletons 
  
- the starting Armatus skin "armor" has 0 Armor Rating, which means you have replace them with actual Armatus Armor, which is craftable at the Blacksmith Forge
  
\* Gynoids and Armati will now spawn wearing their randomized head/face
  
\* All Automaton Follower models use the Greek alphabet now
  
\* Added 12 additional models to each Automaton Follower type, to reduce the chances you will spawn a duplicate
  
\* Renamed Stormsword models to Niniya Alpha-Omega
  
\* Renamed Flamesword models to Galirra Alpha-Omega
  
\* Removed the Greek Alphabet suffix from the Packhorse (Mzarduk) models and replaced them with Roman numerals
  
\* Gynoids now stay cloaked for 30s instead of 10s
  
  
Crafting and General Automaton Tweaks
  
\* All animunculi now have weight when stored in your inventory 
  
- I removed the Magecrafter weight modifier from the mod because it defeats the purpose of the Tesseract Cube
  
\* Reduced the crafting cost for making Jump Charges: all Jump Charges require only 1 Glass and 1 Dwarven Ingot
  
\* Reduced the weight of all Jump Charges to 3
  
\* Added "Dwarven" prefix to all Timelost Dwemer devices
  
\* Renamed all Seekers, Grenades, Explosive Bolts, and equippable devices in such a way that they are grouped by item types now, rather than tiers
  
- e.g. "Dwarven Fire Grenade (Volatile)", "Dwarven Atronach Cube (Chromatic)", "Dwarven Remote Seeker (Advanced)", etc
  
\* Renamed the Stealth Generators to make more sense: "Stealth Generator", "Stealth Generator (Advanced)", and "Stealth Generator (Hypermemetic)"
  
\* Stealth Generators will drain your magicka while in use
  
- Stealth Generator drains 4 magicka, Stealth Generator (Advanced) drains 2 magicka, and the Stealth Generator (Hypermemetic) doesn't drain any at all.
  
\* Added crafting keywords to all craftable items in the mod, for compatibility with Constructible Object Custom Keyword System
  
\* Gynoid Face Plates cost 1 Dwarven Ingot to make 
  
\* All animunculi now weigh 10-40 units when stored in your inventory, as primed or inert 
  
- animunculi do not weigh anything when returned to your inventory in a broken state (for gameplay reasons) 
  
\* Lowered cost of Exploding Steel Bolts and Arrows to 1 Crixic powder instead of 3
  
\* Repriming an Inert Strider should return a Strider scroll to your inventory now, instead of the old misc item Strider
  
\* Lowered damage of Ballistae but added 50% armor penetration to their ranged attacks
  
  
Player Fixes
  
\* Most (hopefully) armors will be visible on Deep Elf player characters now 
  
- this means that modded rings, for example, will be visible on Deep Elves now
  
- I did this by setting the Deep Elf and Deep Elf Vampire races' Armor Race, and the Deep Elf chest, feet, and hands armor addons to NordRace
  
  
Addons:
  
  
Constructible Object Custom Keyword System 
  
\* Adds the Magecrafter category to the applicable crafting stations
  
- e.g. automatons are now categorized under the "Animunculi" section in the "Magecrafter" category of the Blacksmith Forge
  
- this will make finding items and crafting components easier, now
  
- also the organization is nice to look at :)
  
\* List of sections under the Magecrafter category:
  
- Blacksmith Forge and Aetherium Forge 
  
- Animunculi, Autoballistae, Components, Devices, Explosives, Jump Charges, Panoply: Armatus, Panoply: Gynoid, Power Armor, Power Weapons, Repair Kits
  
- Cooking Pot
  
- Crixic Powders, Oils
  
\* Timelost Dwemer crafting categories cover Extra Automatons, too
  
  
Extra Automatons 
  
\* Forwarded all automaton changes from the main mod to the extra autos as well 
  
\* Colossus requires Magecrafter 5 to build now
  
  
Patches:
  
  
CBBE Muscle Solutions Patch
  
\* Cleaned up error records
  
  
Fertility Mode Fixes Patch
  
\* Fixed the missing textures on dwemer kiddos
  
  
Mysticism Patch
  
\* A tiny patch, and not really needed. All it does is make it so that the Deep Elf Soul Trap spell uses Mysticism's Soul Trap magic effect. 
  
- If you don't know how to merge plugins, or if you don't want another plugin in your load order, then just use the base game's Soul Trap spell instead of the Deep Elf Soul Trap spell.
  
  
Perma Patch
  
\* Updated for Magecrafter level 5
  
  
SPERG Patch
  
\* Updated for Magecrafter level 5
  
  
Adamant Patch
  
\* Updated for Magecrafter level 5
  
\* Updated Magecrafter level 4's description, noting that it requires Weaponsmith lvl2 to unlock
  
  
Ordinator Patch
  
\* Updated for Magecrafter level 5
  
\* Updated Magecrafter level 4's description, noting that it requires Dwemeric Weapon Studies to unlock
  
  
Vokrii Patch
  
\* Updated for Magecrafter level 5
  
  
Vokriinator Patch 
  
\* Updated Magecrafter level 1 for TLD version 2.1
  
  
yunico's Vokriinator Patch 
  
\* No update needed, but I did update the description in the installer: the thing that makes yuniko's patch different from the other Vokriinator Patch is that it adds the Magecrafter perks to the Smithing perk tree as individual perk nodes, rather than upgrades of a single perk.
  
  
Vokriinator Black Patch
  
\* Fixed Magecrafter level 4 so that it requires Dwemeric Weapon Smithing, and updated the description to reflect this
  
  
Housekeeping:
  
  
Installer
  
\* Cleaned up some backup bloat files and compressed the image files in the installer by a considerable amount, reducing the installer's size by 72mb
  
  
Hotfix 1
  
\* Hotfixed invisible body bug for CBBE Muscle Sol, Requiem Patches, and Diverse Racial Skeletons
  
  
Hotfix 2
  
Main Mod
  
\* Removed the extra damage resistance from the power armors
  
\* Fixed the power armor active magic effect descriptions
  
  
Follower Addon
  
\* Hotfixed invisible body bug for Follower Addon
  
  
[Version 2.2]
  
  
UPDATE WARNING AND NOTES
  

  
* Most plugins and patches are now esl'ified plugins, which means they won't count toward the 255 plugin limit.
﻿- Also, Extra Automatons no longer needs Skyrim Immersive Creatures.
  

  

  
* The aforementioned changes have resulted in form changes throughout all affected addons and patches, and may result in the loss of perks and items.
- ﻿NOTE: the main plugin is not affected, and equipment and automatons from the main mod will not be lost. However, perk patch users, for example, may lose their Magecrafter perks upon updating. 
  

  

  
* Before updating: take stock of your perks and equipment. After updating, re-add them to your character via a cheat mod (such as Immersive Cheat Menu) or via console commands.
﻿- Users of Extra Automatons MAY lose their automaton scrolls and other items from this plugin. So please take note of your belongings before updating so you can re-add them to your inventory.
  
* ﻿- 99% of items and perks can be recovered through console commands.
﻿- Unfortunately, Fertility Mode users will lose their baby to the void upon updating. 
  
* ﻿- Timelost Dwemer followers may also be reset upon updating. So please clear out their inventories before updating.

  
* ﻿- In somewhat better news, however is that most automaton scrolls will not be lost in the update, as they were unaffected by the form changes.

[Version 2.22]
  
  
Main Mod
  
\* Fixed typo in Crixic powder names, originally written as Krixic, but now spelled Crixic to be consistent with the documentation

[Version 2.25]
  
  
Main Mod 
  
\* The Maleficarum Curse spell description was moved to a magic effect description instead
  
- this lets me change the spell description without directly modifying the spell
  
\* Added new spell TLD Debug: Dispel Animunculi and Active Effects
  
- this spell will clear all active effects from the player, and dispel all active animunculi. Note: simulacra NPC's will not be dispelled. 
  
- Use this spell to clear unwanted "Deployed: Dwarven Ancillae/Armigeri/Packhorse" active effects from your spellbook
  
- Ancillae/Armigeri/Packhorse active effects are unneeded and may be cluttering your spellbook, so they can be safely dispelled without affectin your game or deployed simulacra

Sacrilege Unified Patch
  
\* Resolves formlist conflicts with Sacrilege Patch changes in both the Timelost Dwemer and Ancient Falmer.
  
  
[Version 2.26]
  
  
Main Mod
  
\* SKSE is no longer required 
  
- SKSE was originally used by my mod to add most of the Timelost Dwemer perks and spells to the player
  
- This is no longer needed, as I've added these perks and spells directly to the Timelost Dwemer race, rather than through RaceMenu with SKSE scripts
  
- I did this in case Bethesda decides to release Skyrim a 4th time and break SKSE for everyone again
  
  
Perk Overhaul Patches 
  
\* All perk overhaul patches have been updated to support the new version
  
\* Please report bugs, such as missing chrono abilities or being unable to craft Timelost Dwemer automata etc

[/spoiler]
  
**[Version 2.3 - The Ancient Darkness Patch]**
  
Spoiler
  
**Ancient Darkness and Perils of the Void** 
  
\* Added new perks and curses to expand upon the lore of the Timelost Dwemer, explaining the origin of your chronokinetic powers and its association with the Void, and punishing the hubris of the dwemer.
  
\* Chronokinetic Feedback has been renamed to Perils of the Void
  
  
**\* ANCIENT DARKNESS** - Not so much of a perk, but more of a lore explanation for your chronokinetic spells.
  
    - "Your return to Mundus hurled you through dimensions outside of the known realms of Aurbis. You remember only a split second of unspeakable darkness, but in that second, a presence older than Oblivion stained your soul. The power of the Void crackles across your flesh, and while you may wield it to manipulate time and space, your powers will cost you dearly. Exercise extreme caution..."
  
  
**\* VOID PATHOSIS** - Inspired by Void Pathosis from ESO, Timelost Dwemer's Void Pathosis is a chronic wasting disease that is inflicted upon the player after using Time Warp for the first time.
  
    - the true purpose of this curse is to "encourage" players to utilize Timelost Dwemer's crafting system to survive.
  
    - Void Pathosis is an incurable, interdimensional curse that is triggered by chronokinetic powers. Continuous chrono-casting will further exacerbate your pathosis, triggering Void Necrosis, which slowly kills you over time (it also stacks).
  
    - Void Pathosis may be SUPPRESSED with ATRONACH CUBES, causing it to no longer trigger Void Necrosis.
  
    - Void Pathosis is mostly incurable, but equipping a Chronokinetic Stabilizer (now renamed to Voidspace Stabilizer) will eliminate it and your Maleficarum curse, and render you immune to the Perils of the Void
  
    - Life hack: if you equip an Atronach Cube before casting Time Warp, you will never be afflicted with Void Pathosis.
  
        - Players are warned TWICE in the Ancient Darkness perk, and in Time Warp to exercise extreme caution when using your ultimate powers. Use your superior dwemer intellect to cure your pathosis!
  
  
***\* B-but I just want to unga bunga bandits with warhammers!!!*"
  
    - You have three choices:**
  
    - don't abuse your transcendental powers, and you won't be punished for your hubris.
  
    - use the crafting system to survive and eventually eliminate your curses
  
    - remove Void Pathosis by installing one of the lower difficulty patches.
  
        - don't bother trying to remove Void Pathosis ingame with console commands. An array of scripts and spells will continue to re-apply the curse to you every time you use your chronokinesis.
  
        
  
**Dwemer Vampire Expansion**
  
**\* Added Undeath Ascendent perk** - Giving into your bloodthirst hones your chronokinetic powers.
  
**\* Void Stalker** - Your Warp Jump power now renders you invisible for 2 seconds. Equipping Warp Cores further augments the duration of your invisibility.
  
**\* Void Tear** - Equipping a Warp Core adds Void Tear to your spell book. Void Tear paralyzes and teleports enemies toward you.
  
**\* Added new haemomantic automata (haemonculi):**
  
    - these automata are craftable by vampires (of any race) only
  
    **- Haemolacrum - Ancilla Bloodborne Mk1 and Mk2** - Haemomantic Ancillae that wield blood magic that siphons vitality back to their masters. Mk1 casts Blood Drain, a concentrated drain spell akin to Vampire Drain. Mk2 casts Blood Bolt, similar to Fireball but it absorbs health, and Blood Cloak, which absorbs health from nearby enemies.
  
   **- Haemonculus - Bloodletter** - Haemomantic variant of the Flayer that wields blood magic. Casts Bloodbite, which is a lesser version of Blood Bolt. Its melee attacks also absorb health from their victims.
  
\* Added new haemomantic Warp Core variants, which increase the effectiveness of your haemonculi blood siphons, as well as doing the same thing warp cores do.
  
**New Items** 
  
\* Atronach Cubes no longer increase your Deployment Limit. This functionality has been replaced with Dwarven Control Wands. See below:
  
**\* Added Dwarven Control Wands** 
  
    - These "armor" pieces, when equipped, increase your Deployment Limit
  
    - Comes in 5 increasingly powerful varieties
  
  
**Other Minor Changes**
  
\* Timelost Atronach Cube renamed to Transcendental Atronach Cube
  
\* Added jump charges and jump charge recipes for upgraded ancillae mk2's
  
\* Removed magecrafter requirements for jump charge recipes, so you can jump charge autos that you've salvaged at any level
  
\* Warp Cores can only be crafted by non-vampire races
  
\* Simulacra no longer clog up your active magic effects
  
  
**Requiem Patch (New!)**
  
\* Adds compatibility for Requiem. AE supported.
  
\* Fozar's Requiem Patch is no longer supported.
  
**SkyRem Patch (New!)**
  
\* Adds compatibility for the SkyRem Perk Overhaul
  
  
**Sacrilege Patch**
  
\* Removed Undeath Ascendent abilities from Deep Elf Vampires, because they have been integrated into the main mod
  
  
**[Version 2.301 Hotfix]**
  
  
**Main Mod**
  
\* Void Necrosis no longer applies if you have Void Suppression active. 
  
\* Time Warp should no longer apply Void Pathosis either if you have Void Suppression active.
  
  
**[Version 2.302 Hotfix]**
  
  
**Main Mod**
  
\* Drakaina and Drakaina MKII recipes are fixed so they produce the correct unit now
  
\* Added Jump Charge for Armiger MKII
  
  
**Follower RDO Patch**
  
\* Fixed Nizrok's infinite magecrafter 4 book bug 
  
  
**Difficulty Patches**
  
\* In both patches, Void Pathosis and Void Necrosis are no longer added to the player when Time Warp is used
