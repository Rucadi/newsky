**The Frozen Heart Paper Map for FWMF by Limon**
  
It's a paper map for [The Frozen Heart](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/159911) mod by Kreiste and wSkeever. Hope it will help you to navigate here and will add little bit of immersion. Mod continues series of paper maps for a [Flat World Map Framework (FWMF)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29932).
  
  
Some things to know about this map:

  
* Best FWMF package for this map is  "FWMF for Fantasy Paper Maps", it renders colors closest to original.
Map texture is 4K, plugin flagged as ESL.
  
* Map was commissioned to [Limon](https://www.instagram.com/acbasaran/)﻿, my part was traced image, mesh, calibration, labels and minor edits.
2 versions available - with maze revealed on the map and covered with the clouds.[﻿](https://postimg.cc/N57rKdvb)

Flat World Map Framework uses mainly vertical look at map, but allows limited inclination and rotation with held right button as well.
  
MCM in FOMOD and config INI file with comments included in FWMF allows to tune map control (keyboard, mouse and gamepad), possible angles and blur.

**Installation**
  
The archive is mod manager compatible.
  
  
Install [size=3][FWMF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29932) FOMOD first (Fantasy Paper Maps package preferable). Make sure FMWF is the last in plugins list (only weather fixes or FWMF various patches may be lower), then install this mod normally and place it last in mod order.
  
  
Install only **one** version, either clear or with clouds.
  
  
[/size][size=3]FWMF 1.9.981+ includes whitelisting for the map and you don't need to anything additionally.
  
  
If you have older version or curate your own whitelist, add worldspace to the whitelist find FlatMapMarkersSSE.json in Flat World Map Framework/SKSE/Plugins/ and add this block in the same fashion other blocks added:
  
  
[/size]
> {
>   
>  "name": "Crag Spire Wastes",
>   
>  "editorID": "ksws07World",
>   
>  "markerHeight": 180000,
>   
>  "enabled": true
>   
>  }

  
FWMF 1.9.981+ also includes config with custom pan speed on the map for [Baka World Map Pan Speed](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/153672).
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
[size=3]SE/AE/GOG compatible (1.6.1130 including), but be sure to pick your exact Skyrim version during FWMF FOMOD installation (first option for 1.6.1130).
  
Not compatible with map mods except [FMWF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29932).
  
  
[/size]**Recommended Mods**
  
[Atlas Map Markers - Updated with MCM](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24104)﻿ works perfect and smaller markers make map more readable. Just be sure to put Atlas' .esp before FWMF in load order.
  
  
Get along with most UI overhauls.
  
  
**Known Issues**
  
None so far.
  
  
**For mapmakers, modders and modlist authors**
  
If you would like to create your own paper-like maps for Skyrim, its DLCs and add-ons, you just need to ask me in Discord - it is simpler than it seems. Some maps are technically ready for drawing already, for others I will provide detailed instructions what to do.
  
  
Modlist authors who wish to add FWMF maps to their lists and have requests to tune/fix some things, feel free to PM me, I will try to help  the best I can.
