**Features**
  
**Better Models and Names**
  
When you create potions or poisons at the Alchemy Table, they will copy their name and appearance from the most similar item from the game's leveled lists. Potions with multiple effects or impurities will have additional suffixes to indicate this.
  
  
These leveled lists are read by the mod:

00065A3E LItemPotionFortifyHealthBest

00074A27 LItemPoisonDamageMagickaLingeringBest

**Impure Mixtures**
  
Impurities in potions and poisons will now **subtract** from the item's cost instead of add to it. You will no longer earn much experience or gold from making them.
  
  
**Rounded Effect Potency**
  
For magnitude-based effects, any magnitude above 25 will be rounded to the nearest multiple of 5. For duration-based effects, any duration above 15 seconds will be rounded to the nearest multiple of 5. This prevents you from creating many different potions/poisons with incremental differences that clutter up your inventory as you level up.
  
  
**Better UI Hints**
  
Combinations of incompatible ingredients will display as grayed out in the UI when you know all of their effects, without having to test them.
