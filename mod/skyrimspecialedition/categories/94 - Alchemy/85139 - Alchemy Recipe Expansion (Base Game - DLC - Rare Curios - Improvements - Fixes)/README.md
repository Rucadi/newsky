**DESCRIPTION**
  
  
Intelligently and thoughtfully expands the pool of available recipes found in the base game by utilizing unused ingredient combinations.
  
Ingredients were chosen from [Dawnguard](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dawnguard), [Hearthfire](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Hearthfire), [Dragonborn](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dragonborn), and the [Anniversary Edition](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Anniversary_Edition) update. **Over 50 new recipes!**
  
  
Recipes typically contain two ingredients of similar qualities – i.e. Morrowind items are pair with Morrowind items.
  
Recipes were chosen and valued with balance in mind – designed to play nicely with the mod [Apothecary](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52130).
  
  
Currently, Alchemy Recipe Expansion is soft-compatible with most alchemy overhauls.
  
Works great withand perfectly complements [Recipe Auto-Learn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/84909). Go check it out!
  
  
  
**THE "PROBLEM"**
  
  
There are very few recipe notes in the vanilla game (only around 20), and they're all for only a few, very common ingredients you might be familiar with. On top of this, they only cover a small handful of potion effects for common potions. Updates, DLC, and Creations expanded the number of ingredients and potion effects there can be in the game but were never given recipes.
  
  
  
**BASE OBJECT SWAPPER**If you have [Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805) installed, some of the (few) hand-placed recipes in the overworld are replaced with some of the recipes found in this mod. As an example, [Avrusa Sarethi](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Avrusa_Sarethi) on [Sarethi Farm](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Sarethi_Farm) keeps a paralysis recipe in her home. This will be swapped with the new Resist Magic Potion Recipe, which is only found in this mod and is an effect found in [Nirnroot](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Nirnroot). Additionally, [Honeyside](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Honeyside)﻿ has had its recipes you are gifted from upgrading your home swapped out with a trio of recipes found in this mod.
