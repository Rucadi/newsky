As a primarily archer player myself,  finding salts to craft elemental arrows and bolts sometimes can be tedious and a chore. So with using Skypatcher this mod adds elemental salts to alchemy vendors (fire, frost and void).  With your choice  of 5,10,15 and 20 quantities. If you would like a larger amount just let me know and I will try to upload a version with the amount you would like. I have included an optional file to lower the cost of the ingredients significantly.
