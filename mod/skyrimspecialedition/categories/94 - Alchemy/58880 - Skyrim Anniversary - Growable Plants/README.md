SpoilerIronwood Nut
  
**NOTE:** Ironwood Nut will be plantable after completion of the "A Dying Wish" quest. You get this quest if you select the "Nothing" cup.**A Note on the Trees:** Green Apple, Red Apple and Ironwood Nut are best planted outside and away from sides of buildings (to prevent clipping). While I have scaled the size down, any smaller than what they currently are just looks odd. Like a tiny bonsi bush. Horrible.
  
**Installation:**
  
  
Download the **sm\_CC\_GP\_AEComplete** file and extract the file to your Skyrim Mods folder. **Using Bruma**? Then download: **sm\_GP\_AEBS** instead. Do not use both files.
  
  
**Combatibility:**Not compatible with any mod that alters the Form lists or adds other growable plants such as:
  
  
More Growable Plants
  
Complete Alchemy Cooking Overhaul
  
  
It is also not compatible with my [Saints and Seducers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30729?tab=description) [Growable plants](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30729?tab=description)﻿﻿(The predecessor to this mod)
  
**Older versions of Skyrim:**
  
The mod only supports the latest version of Skyrim. I will not be supporting older versions nor provide support for older versions.
  
If you are downgrading/running an older version I will not be able to support/answer questions on this.
  
If you have modified the mod to allow it to run on older versions and its not working I suggest you update your game and reinstall the mod.
  
  
  
**A note on the Bruma Edition:**There are some crossover "ingredients/foods" that can be planted. Once the Bruma version is planted it will yield the Rare Curious version. If you want to keep the unique effects from Bruma on these ingredients  [Creation Club Curious and Zombies -BS Synergy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28630)﻿ works great alongside this mod.
  
**FAQ:**
  
  
  
**Q**: Why have you added the Dragonborn and Dawnguard plants when other mods do this?
  
  
**A**: Other mods add these in yes, but in order to do so they have to edit the same FormList. The mod which loads last will be the Formlist loaded. Essentially they override each other.
  
  
  
**Q:** I can't plant Ironwood Nut, why?
  
  
**A:** Did you select the Nothing option at the shrine and complete the relevant quest "A Dying Wish"? The Ironwood Nut is only plantable after the completion of this quest for a number of reasons: Firstly the Ironwood trees are only found during that quest. Secondly the Quest marks the Ironwood Nut ingredient as a quest item, so it can be removed from your inventory (and therefore planted) until completion of the quest.
  
**Q**: Skyrim doesnt have Aloe Vera, why have you added it?
  
  
**A**: Aloe Vera Leaves are an ingredient that were added via the official  \_ResourcePack.eslfile. It was included with [Special Edition Patch 1.6.1130](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Special_Edition_Patch#1.6.1130), released on December 5, 2023. They can be purchased from the [Khajiit caravans](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Khajiit_Traders) . Aloe Vera Leaves were fully compatible with hearthfire and able to be planted.
  
  
**Q:** If they can be planted already why have you included them?
  
  
**A:** The mod was made before the ResourcePack.esl update, therefore causing it to override the changes made by the update. By including the ResourcePack.esl as a master file I brought forward the change and re-introduced them into the FormLists
  
  
**Q:** I dont use Skyrim Anniversary Edition but I have Saints & Seducers/Rare Curios. Will this mod work?
  
  
**A:** No. Instead use [Saints and Seducers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30729?tab=description) [Growable plants](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30729?tab=description)﻿**[b]**[/b]
  
  
**[b][b]Q:** [/b][/b]I don't own the Anniversary content but I do own Saints and Seducers/Rare Curios, Goblins, Bittercup and The Cause seperatly. Will this work?
  
**[b]
  
[b]A:** [/b][/b]Yes - the mod only uses those creations as "masters" - so if you own all of them seperatly instead of the Anniversary Edition then this mod will work.
  
  
**Q**: I use Beyond Skyrim Bruma. Which file do I download?
  
  
**A**: Download sm\_GP\_AEBS.
  
  
  
**Q**: Beyond Skyrim Bruma has an Aloe Vera plant. Does that mean I will get two different types when planted?
  
  
**A**: No. If you plant Aloe Vera from Beyond Skyrim the plany will yield Skyrims Aloe Vera.
  
  
  
**Q**: I planted the correct ingrediants but I get diffrent plants or ingrediants when I harvest. Why?
  
  
**A**: You have a mod that is causing a conflict. Any mod that adds in plantable ingredients via modifying the formlists will be incompatible. Unless they use Formlist Manipulator which allows new plantables to be injected into formlists without modifying them directly. Such examples of mods not compatible include CACO or Growable coffee.
  
  
**Q:** Will you make a patch for CACO?
  
  
**A:** No. I do not use CACO and while I know many people would like a patch it is not something I have the time nor desire to do.
  
  
  
**Q**: This file was included on your Creation Club Growable plant mod page, why the seperate upload?
  
  
**A**: To reduce confusion over which version of the mod to use and help with quality control when identifying which version a reported bug might be relating to. Its to help streamline support for mainstream use.
  
  
**Q**: You are making a lot of mods based on Creation Club content. Creation club is nothing more than Bethesda Paid Mods, Micro transactions and greed. Your supporting....BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH.
  
  
**A**: This is not the place to air your frustrations, opinons, arguments or hate for the Creation Club. Simply put: You dont use the Creation Club? Why are you in my comments.
  
  
  
Lastly a huge thank you to everyone who reported the bugs with the older versions and big appology for making you all wait so long for a fix.
