For those, like me who like when mods are consistent with the rest of the game.
  
  
   There are currently only three mods that can be downloaded. Two of those are directly related to RFM as a whole while the last one is a fix for those that experience a certain conflict.
  
  
   RFM - Tempering adds smithing requirements. Such as perks or material from recipies that did not have them. PLEASE NOTE that the missing requirements were intended by the original author. as was stated on the original mod file in the notes section question 5
  
Spoiler5. The questions have repeatedly arisen - why is no ingot needed to sharpen swords? Because sharpening is the removal of a layer of metal, not application. IMHO.The authors, is of course correct, in this statement, however it is not consistent with the design of the game with ever other weapons requiring materials. So with other mods adding equipment that require ingredients, this one becomes noticible.
  
  
   By request from hhyhhy96211 (lovely name) this one was made after they pointed out that certain weapons, when paired with Animated armoury, became much stronger then their counterparts. For example, take steel, the mace does more damage when compared to the sword but is significantly slower. Following this logic, the rapier introduced with RFM that had a high attack speed had a noticibly higher base damage (12, when compared to the swords 8). This file simply lowers that base damage of the added rapier to 7.
  
  
   Iron visual glitch is for those like me who use forgotten retexture or something similar that retxtures and reshapes the "pickaxe02.dds" file.
  
  
   RFM - Crafting disables multiple recepies, such as the silver and forsworn weapons. This was again done in the spirit to somewhat having consistency since these weapons could not be forged in the main game.
