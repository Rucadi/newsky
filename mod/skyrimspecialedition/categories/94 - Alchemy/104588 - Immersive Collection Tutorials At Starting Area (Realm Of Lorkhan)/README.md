**This mod won't make much sense without my Collections. You have been warned.**
  
  
  
So you've installed 100s of mods but do not know how some of these work and you do not have the time to visit all the mod pages?
  
  
I've created this beautiful, visualized book and also changed some things around in the starting area to make it more user-friendly for new users of my collections. 
  
  
Here are the changes listed:
  
  
**1) A new book has been created & placed** on the table on the left. This book contains ALL you may need to know about controls and some tips in the collection. 
  
In the later revisions I'll also place a controller scheme here too.
  
  
  
Here is how you can find the book:

﻿The book is long, but I'll share 2-3 pages from it just to give you an idea

2) Starting stone locations have been changed, so the first and most visible stone to pick is the Whiterun stone and it is right in front of the user (There used to be a stone that teleported you to a sunken ship in the north in its place)
