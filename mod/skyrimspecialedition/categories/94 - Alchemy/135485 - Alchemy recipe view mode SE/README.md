**DESCRIPTION**
  
  
This is a Special Edition port of the [Alchemy recipe view mode](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/110495) LE mod with permission of the original author, [rkkn](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/rkkn).   The original needed a custom DLL.  This version instead relies on a couple of recent and popular SKSE libraries.
  
  
ESL flagged.
  
  
**ORIGINAL DESCRIPTION**
  
  
I [rkkn] made this because I got tired of having to carry around 1 of every ingredient just to be able to see the recipes. This way I can get the  best of both worlds: I can keep a light inventory and carry around only  what I need and can still see all my recipes so I can know what I need  to collect.
  
  
While in the alchemy menu, press backslash "\" to swap to recipe viewing mode. Press it again to swap back.  And that's it.
  
  
FEATURES
  

  
* Doesn't unlock anything you don't already know.
Crafting is disabled until you swap back.
  
* It's possible to rebind the hotkey by setting the global variable in the console (xzAlchemyHelper\_keyCode)
