A not so simple mod I cooked up that allows players to finally rename their crafted potions in the alchemy menu. Supports 1.6.1170+ AE, 1.6.640 AE and 1.5.97 SE.

* Role playing opportunities. Become the greatest Skooma dealer in Skyrim!
Inventory management. Easily differentiate between player crafted god potions and in-game trash.
  
* Well integrated into the base game crafting menu akin to the enchanting rename.
Potion recipe names are saved.
  
* Install and uninstall anytime.

The F button no longer Clears Selections and will now rename your potion. Pressing this button allows you to modify the name similar to renaming an Enchanted item.

* [**SKSE**](https://skse.silverlock.org/) - Hard Requirement
[**Address Library for SKSE Plugins**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444) - Hard Requirement﻿
  

  
Install using your mod manager. Select options from FOMOD. Open the console and you should see "RenamePotionsSKSE has been loaded" or something.

* First check that you have the correct Address Library installed for your Skyrim version as well as SKSE installed. Also check that the game version matches the plugin's target game version.
Then go to the SKSE logs folder, its located in 'Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition\SKSE' for me and copy the RenamePotionsSKSE.log. Additionally if your game crashed, copy the crash log as well. You will need [Crash Logger](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59818)﻿ for the crash log.
  
* Write a detailed post about the issue in the posts tab and I will take a look at it. Also please include your GAME VERSION as well.

  
  
In terms of **compatibility**, this mod may have issues with mods that alter the crafting menu UI. It works completely with SkyUI and base game UI but other mods may have issues. It also may have issues with SKSE plugins that modify potion creation.
