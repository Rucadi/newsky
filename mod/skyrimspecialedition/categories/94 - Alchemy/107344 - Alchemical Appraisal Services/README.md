You can ask alchemists to identify the ingredients' effects for you, at a cost.
  
  
**How it works:**
  
When you talk to an alchemist you'll see a new option, "Can you identify the properties of these ingredients?", selecting it opens a menu where you select your desired ingredients that you want to find their effects.
  
  
**Pricing:**
  
The pricing is calculated on the fly, each effect on the ingredient costs 15 gold by default, so for an ingredient of 4 effects that totals to 60 gold. If that seems a lot, consider that this service frees you from taking 2 (3?) perks, so ~4500 gold to identify the effects of 100 ingredients sounds very generous. Also you're not charged for effects you already know.
  
The money is deposited into their inventory, in case you want to take it back.
  
  
**Compatibility:**
  
Should be compatible with mods that add new ingredients or modify them. Also should be compatible with new alchemy shops, provided they have the proper faction.
  
  
SKSE is required. Mod is flagged as ESL so it does not take space in your load order.
