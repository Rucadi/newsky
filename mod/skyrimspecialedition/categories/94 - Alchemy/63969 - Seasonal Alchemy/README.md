Were those herbaceous plants blooming in the snow bugging you? They were bugging me, too, so I made them stop doing it. Now, with Seasons of Skyrim installed, alchemy plants will have their own lifecycles - growing and flowering in spring and summer, dying down in the autumn and dormant in the winter. I've tried to get a good spread of availability over the 3 growing seasons, so there should always be something available unless it's the dead of winter.
  
  
I have absolutely no idea how this will affect gameplay, since I made it as a realism mod. I imagine that alchemist characters will want to stock up on things they need (finally, an excuse to pick all those mountain flowers), and maybe even [gasp] *buy* ingredients in winter.
  
  
Requires Seasons of Skyrim. Doesn't currently work on fish, butterflies, mushrooms, bird nests or a couple of other types of flora (such as creep clusters) because Seasons doesn't support swapping those. If they get added, I'll update the mod.
  
  
Conflicts with Shrubs of Snow. If using both, rename the Seasonal Alchemy winter ini file so that it comes alphabetically after SoS (i.e. zzzSeasonal Alchemy\_WIN.ini). Thanks to wSkeever for open permissions on Shrubs of Snow - I used their textures to make my winter juniper and lavender bushes.
  
  
**FAQ**
  
  
**Q. Does this affect greenhouses?****A.** No: Seasons only affects exterior cells, and this is nothing more than a Seasons preset.
  
  
**Q. Compatibility with CACO/Apothecary/other alchemy mods?
  
A.** Completely compatible! Doesn't touch any of the same records at all.
