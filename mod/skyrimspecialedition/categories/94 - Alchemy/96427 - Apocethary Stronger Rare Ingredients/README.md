This micromod is a tweak of Apothecary by SimonMagus and requires it. As part of it's alchemy overhaul, Apothecary standardizes the magnitude of ingredients. This means a Daedra Heart and a Wheat are equally effective in the creation of a healing potion and lessens the excitement of finding and using rare or expensive ingredients. I've made the following changes to ingredients.
  
  
Daedra Heart: Base Price increased to 400. 5x stronger Damage Health effect. 4x stronger Restore Health, Stamina, and Magicka effects.
  
Depending on which part of the heart that is used, Daedra Hearts can make the strongest of poisons or the greatest of panaceas.
  
  
Fire/Frost/Void salts: Base Price standardized at 100. They have Resist their Element at 2x strength, Weakness to their Element at 2x strength, and Restore H/M/S corresponding to their element at 2x strength, and Fortify Magicka at 2x Strength.
  
These are expensive and comparatively hard to find in the base game, and can now be used to make strong restorative or resistance potions, or potions which increase the magical capacity of mages.
  
  
Giant's Toe: Base Price increased to 100. It has fortify health and stamina at 2x strength, Become Ethereal and Fortify Shout at standard strength.
  
Giant's Toes need to be harvested from giant's and are thus hard to get, but make the ultimate warrior's boon.
  
  
Crimson Nirnroot: Base Price increased to 91. Damage Health at 2x strength, Become Ethereal, Invisibility at 2x Duration, Resist Magic at 2x strength. This plant can only be found deep in Blackreach, now there is a reason for alchemists to be excited by the properties of this plant.
  
  
Since this allows alchemists to make much stronger potions if they use these ingredients, it is a straight buff to alchemists allowing them a vastly greater power ceiling.
