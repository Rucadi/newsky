SKSE is NOT required on the Special Edition for this mod.  I rewrote the script for the SE.  Huge thanks to Raxdiam for telling me about the SE scripting changes. 
  
   
A book titled "Ancient Text" will be automatically given to the player. Every time it is read you will receive 1, 3, 5, or 10 perk points depending on your choice. You can read it as many times as you like. Yes, this is a cheat item.
  
   
Physically, this book looks just like the Oghma Infinium.
