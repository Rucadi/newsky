I made this mod for myself and realized no one uploaded one yet for SSE, so I decided to share.
  
   
Pretty simple - This mod lowers the requirements to get the rewards for the radiant quests of the Thieves Guild
  

  
* Before you needed to do: 5, 15,25,35,45,55,75,125 quests to get the full rewards as well as 5 in each Hold before the Hold specific quest. (I personally never made it above 35 without getting bored out of my mind and using console commands)
Now you only have to do ONE quest in each Hold to get the corresponding quest and the levels for the items at the Guild Master's desk are: 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12.
  

  
12 radiant quests are all you need to do to get it all done.
  
   
Enjoy!
  
   
   
PS- This should even work if you already have done some of the radiant quests - users have confirmed that.
