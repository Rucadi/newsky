Sometimes boneheaded Jarls still refuse to sell you a house even you have fulfilled all of the requirements. Fret not, you can now buy the house (or land) anyway, without being a thane. This mod comes with two versions: Normal price and 1 septim version. Upgrades still cost normal, though. ESP-FE, so it doesn't cost a load order. NOTE: For Windhelm's Hjerim, you will need to complete Blood on the Ice quest first. I suggest [Blood on the Ice (BOTI) redux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6126) mod.
  
  
This mod, combined with [Thane Fail-Safe](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12349)﻿, should overcome the buggered thaneship quests. It carries all the relevant [USSEP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266) fixes, even though it does not depend on it. SSE only, sorry.
  
  
Inspired by [No Requirement to buy houses](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32364) mod from Old Rim.

If you have [Blood on the Ice Redux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6126) (BOTI Redux), install this mod below it.
