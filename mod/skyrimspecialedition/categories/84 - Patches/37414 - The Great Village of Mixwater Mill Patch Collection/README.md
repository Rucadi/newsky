Continuing with my series of "I want to run with unique architecture everywhere, but that requires SO MANY compatibility patches" series....Mixwater Mill! soldierofwar put together a lovely little overhaul of Mixwater Mill in his [The Great Village of Mixwater Mill](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36350)﻿, and I've put together a series of compatibility patches for things in my load order which needed it. This one is rather small - not that many things which needed to be patched, and I've avoided reinventing the wheel for any patches that exist elsewhere. All patches are ESP flagged as ESL, unless otherwise noted.
  
  
*Included Patch Descriptions*
  
  
[Cheesemod for EVERYONE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36506) - Shifts a few added cheeses to match the new interior. Last checked against version 1.01
  
  
[Enhanced Lights and FX](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2424) ﻿- Only one patch this time around, due to there being a new building and wanting to keep consistency in lighting mood across all of
  
 them. Forwards any conflicts having Great Village of Mixwater Mill win, shifted any added smoke to match the new interiors, and shifted door lights where appropriate. Last checked against version 3.06.
  
  
Immersion Patch - TGVoMM has an instance of Jessica's Wine which this patch changes to Alto Wine to maintain its uniqueness.
  
  
[Landscape and Water Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26138) - Conflict resolution for records touched by both mods, forwarding ownership changes. Last checked against version 5.3
  
  
[Lanterns of Skyrim II](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30817) ﻿- Forwards cell settings (mostly water) from Update.esm to match LoS II settings. Forwards a light intensity change to its new location, and removes a peg it was hanging on. Last checked against version 4.0
  
  
[Milandriel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56466) - Navmesh conflict resolution. Last checked against version 1.2.1
  
  
[RS Children Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2650) - Makes the added child work with RS Children Overhaul. I couldn't seem to get the facegen to export, so this ended up being a bit of a
  
work-around, and the child is a clone of another kid elsewhere in Skyrim. You'd probably have never noticed if I didn't say anything. Last checked against version 1.1.3.
  
  
[Skyrim's Unique Treasures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5261) - Shifts the location of a placed object and chest to match the new interior/exterior. Last checked against version 4.4
  
  
[Snazzy Furniture and Clutter Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2414) - Shifts a placed painting to match new interior. Last checked against version 1.7
  
  
[Thieves Guild Requirement](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33256)﻿ - Shifts a marker for version 5.0+
  
  
[Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266) - Conflict resolution patch which forwards some ownership/cell changes. Last checked against version 4.2.3.
  
  
Other patches I'm aware of: [Immersive Laundry](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42423?), [Chicken Coop Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52341?tab=description)[size=2], [Medieval Lanterns of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65198)*Installation*[/size]
  
Use a mod manager/organizer to install, or drop the loose files into you Skyrim data folder. Patches should have their appropriate masters set, and should be loaded after any mods which they are patching. Some of the fixes in question are on persistent objects, and may require a new save.
  
  
*Compatibility*
  
I don't believe this should introduce any incompatibilities beyond anything which may be present between base mods. All moved objects should have been moved to locations which are non-overlapping. Let me know if you hit anything
