This is a MCM for all the variants of the original Amorous Adventures (no amorous adventure plus).
  
  
This MCM lets you enable and disable the dialogues that start specific Amorous adventure quests, so you can have better immersion compatibility with other romance mods (solutions, ostim lovers, shadowman mods, martian mods, etc.)
  
  
Note that toggling these options mean nothing if the quest has already started or finished, this only toggles whether the initial dialogue is visible that starts these quests.
  
  
Also, you still need to meet the other pre-requisites for a quest to start (except Angel of Steel, I removed that as a requirement for part of the Elisif quest chain)! this isn't a way to bypass and start a quest!
  
  
ESL-flagged.
