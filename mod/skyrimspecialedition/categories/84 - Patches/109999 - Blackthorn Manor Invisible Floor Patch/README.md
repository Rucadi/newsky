The new and improved version of my Blackthorn Manor patch!
  
  
Being very surprised that nobody had ever fixed this before, this is a patch to solve the problem of the missing floorboard in the Blackthorn Manor in [Ld50365](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/6942439)'s incredible mod, [Blackthorn - A Buildable Town in The Rift (SE)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2242). The original version of my fix was super janky, used SSEEDIT and didn't even seem to work 100% of the time. This new version, however, was made using the creation kit after I finally found out what the issue was thanks to some help! Shouldn't be any major problems, if any issues at all.
