[left][Meridia's Order](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/102584) is a cool mod I wanted to make patches for so I did. Please bother me if you have an issue with my patches not [TheOscar0](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/14923029). These patches were made by me ChickenMike and not the original mod authors. All plugins are .ESL flagged .ESPs so they won't take up a place in your load order. I don't think any of these patches require [BEES](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441) ﻿if you're on an older Skyrim version, but Meridia's order requires it anyhow. 
  
  
The screenshots on this page have the potential to be spoilers but I don't think it is particularly egregious. ﻿[/left]

IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU ADD THESE PATCHES TO A NEW GAME. To quote [robertgk2017](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5544506) "Modding is illegal post character start."﻿ You might be able to get away with it but this is neither recommended nor supported.
  
  
PATCHES﻿

[Cities of the North - Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40088) - Moves a bench and some markers so nothing is floating.
  
  
[The Great Village of Old Hroldan](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33189) - Moves an NPC and some markers into the cell properly so they aren't out floating in the void.
  
  
[Guards Armor Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22671) - Ensures a character that should be wearing guard armor is in fact wearing guard armor
  
  
[Hammet's Dungeon Pack 1 SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12186) - Just a navmesh patch that makes the two mods navmeshes work together better.
  
  
[Lollygaggin' - Vanilla Guard Armor Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/117833) - Ensures a character that should be wearing guard armor is in fact wearing guard armor
  
  
[Northern Roads](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77530) - Fixes floating objects around the sanctuary and adjusts the navmeshes to make it all work slightly better.
  
  
[Pilgrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54099) - This is a synergy patch between the two mods. It turns all of Meridia's Orders's Meridia statues into activatable Pilgrim shrines. I also added a couple shrines of Mannimarco to some spots I thought appropriate.  Spoiler I also added a shrine to Fort Justice that dynamically turns from Mannimarco to Meridia when the fort changes hands.  Big thanks to [MissileMann](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/51322576) for helping me with the activators. 
  
  
[RMB SPIDified - Guard Armor Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/83338) -  Ensures a character that should be wearing guard armor is in fact wearing guard armor
  
  
[Sons of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68656) - Gives a character armor that should have SoS armor. Check screenshots. 
  
  
[Stendarr's Beacon Enhanced and Ruhmastered](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16178) - Slight navmesh refinement on Stendaff's beacon as well as some work to make the two navmeshes play nice. 
  
  
[Unofficial Skyrim Modders Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49616) - Combines the skeleton faction records. This patch is most likely unnecessary if you have a bashed patch but best practice is to double check in xedit. 
  
  
[Wintersun - Faiths of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506) - Adds Wintersun Mannimarco shrines to the necromancer lairs in Meridia's Order.

﻿FAQ

  
Q:Didn't this page have a giant beta sticker for one of the patches on it?
  
A:Yeah it did, but now I have actually played the mod, made several more patches and made sure it all worked. 
  
  
Q:Do these patches work with my game version?
  
A:As long as you use [BEES](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441) you should be fine.
  
  
Q:Wow these patches sure look complicated to do how did you make them?
  
A:Truthfully it's not that complicated. It took me like an hour to learn the like an hour to learn the CK and to be honest you should already know how to use SSEedit. Janquel's guide﻿ is an invaluable resource and without it I wouldn't have known where to even start. If I can do it you can too!
  
  
Q:Why are your screenshots so bad?
  
A:I literally haven't intentionally taken a screenshot in Skyrim in my over 1600 hours until the week before I uploaded this. I'll get better hopefully. 
  
  
Q:FOMOD?
  
A:Maybe at some point? I don't see a reason for a page with 5 plugins. 
  
  
Q:Do you take patch requests?
  
A:My primary reason for making patches is personal use but if I can make the patch quickly I'll consider it. 
  
  
Q:You haven't had any recent activity on Nexus and I need to get a hold of you, how can I do that?
  
A:@ChickenMike in either Ryn, or Janquel's discords and I should see it. I'm also in a bunch of other discords, but I check those two the most regularly. 
  
  
Q:Why are you missing so many screenshots?
  
A:I'm lazy and taking screenshots is super tedious and I hate it.
