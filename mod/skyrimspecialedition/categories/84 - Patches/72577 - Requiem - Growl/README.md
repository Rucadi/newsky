Rewrote some texts to be in line with Requiem
  
  
Removed base magic resistance and level-scaled magic resistance
  
Removed base armor and level-scaled armor
  
Removed level-scaled damage
  
Armor and Weapon skills still scale armor and damage
  
Reduced base attack damage by 10 (because of weapon skill scaling)
  
Reduced base health by 100 (because of armor skill scaling and it was huge in Requiem)
  
Reduced base stamina by 100 (because of stamina/magicka scaling)
  
Reduced base carry capacity by 500
  
Removed weakness to poison from werewolves
  
Rebalanced Werebears, they now have the same stats as Werewolves but higher health/carry weight and less stamina)
  
  
Fall damage resistance from 100% to 75%
  
Removed vulnerability to silver (Requiem has its own system for that)
  
Removed the ability to drain health on attacks (the lifesteal perk is rewritten and still intact)
  
Removed the level scaling of argonian poison claws
  
Werebeast blood ingredient value from 20 to 150
  
Rebalanced some perks to be in line with Requiem

**Known Issue:**
  
[/size]*- Gaining skills in Werewolf form doesn't work as intended (you can read up on that in the bugs section of Growl)
