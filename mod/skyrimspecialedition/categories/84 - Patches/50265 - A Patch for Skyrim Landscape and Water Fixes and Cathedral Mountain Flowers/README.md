Thank you to wizkid34 for Landscape and Water Fixes and JonnyWang13 for Cathedral Mountain Flowers.
  
  
Skyrim Landscape and Water Fixes changes the placement of some mountain flowers and adds some locational references. Cathedral mountain Flowers changes the model. The main patch combines the records from both mods.
  
  
The other patches do the same for Cathedral Mountain Flowers and some other mods which also change the placement of some mountain flowers. These are minor in that only a few records are affected for each mod. They are:
  
  
Cutting Room Floor
  
Lanterns of Skyrim II
  
Winterhold Restored
  
Helgen Reborn
  
JK Skyrim
  
Unique Border Gates
  
Skyrim Realistic Conquering - All in One
  
Skyrim Reborn Hjallmarch Hold
  
  
The patch for Skyrim Reborn Hjaalmarch Hold also requires the CRF patch found on the SR Hjaalmarch Hold files page.
  
  
All patches are flagged as ESL and won't count towards your load order.
