**Update 4/6/25:** After three years away from Skyrim, I am attempting to get back into it.  I have not followed any of the developments while I've been gone, so I have some catching up to do.  I also have some patching up to do, it seems, as the current version of RBB has changed and some of my mods are no longer compatible.  I have started working on updating the patches, but my new job gives me little time for modding, so don't expect it to happen quickly.  I will be posting BETA versions as I go in the hope that brave souls will help with the BETA testing.  I can almost guarantee no RBB patch will break your game--at worst you could end up with boats in strange places or moving in odd ways.  If you do find anything like that, please post it on the bugs page and I'll work on it when I can.  First up: Great City of Solitude RBB patch--all boats should be in the correct places and moving correctly.  Some barrels, crates, stairs, etc. are also moving, and some aren't.

This is a collection of patches for Realistic Boat Bobbing and various mods.  I will be adding more patches as I finish them.  With written permission from ToosTruus, I have uploaded all of his patches except the SMIM Mesh Patch to this page, as well.  I eventually plan to make a FOMOD installer.  Patches marked BETA are either incomplete or not fully play tested.  Some static objects on BETAs (Crates, barrels, etc.) may not move yet, but all boats will.  Otherwise, If you see any issues, please message me.
  
  
With version 8, RBB changed how it handles vanilla boats, and, as a result, these patches may cause two boats to appear occupying the same location.  I am working on testing/fixing patches, and will update this page with the status as things progress.  Again, if you notice any problems with mods marked as 8.2 compatible, please let me know.
