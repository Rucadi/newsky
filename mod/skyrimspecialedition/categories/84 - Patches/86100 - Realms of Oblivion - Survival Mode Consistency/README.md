**Why?﻿**

  
So CC Survival Mode has a couple of formlists that mark certain worldspaces, cells, and locations as an area of Oblivion, and as such, pauses your needs appropriately as if you were in a timeless realm, separate from the real world. I think this is a pretty cool mechanic, but by default it only flags base game zones that would meet these guidelines.
  
  
I made these patches primarily for my own game, but figured some people may benefit from them.
