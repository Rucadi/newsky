**Removes the scripted weather change from Immersive College of Winterhold which fixes an issue with using weather mods.** (see screenshots for comparison)
  
The scripted weather change can lead to very jarring weather transitions as seen in the screenshot.
  
  
  
**Compatibility:**
  
Compatible with all weather mods and all CoW mods as long as ICoW is used.
