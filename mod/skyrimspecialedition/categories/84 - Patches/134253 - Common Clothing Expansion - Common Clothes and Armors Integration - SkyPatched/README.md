**Mod Overview**
  
This is a simple mod that integrates the new clothes added by [Common Clothing Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/134088) (CCE) into [Common Clothes and Armors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21305)' (CCA) Level Lists/NPC Outfits via [SkyPatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106659).
  
  
**This makes it so NPCs have a chance to wear the clothes added by [Common Clothing Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/134088) and allows the player to purchase the clothes from Radiant Raiment as well.**
  
The specific details on distribution are listed below. (Descriptions are based on the masculine version of the clothes, refer to the [image above](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/134253/134253-1731897579-1115166767.png) for clarity):
  

  
* The green tunic has been added to CCA's Fine Clothes outfit level list.
The vested and v-neck style tunics have been added to CCA's Commoner outfit level list.
  
* The multi-layered tunic ([the one on the far left](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/134253/134253-1731897579-1115166767.png)﻿) has been added to CCA's Merchant outfit level list.

**Requirements** 
  
[Common Clothing Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/134088) (CCE)
  
[Common Clothes and Armors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21305) (CCA) or the [RMB SPIDified Version](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/102319)
  
[SkyPatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106659)*On the CCA requirement*, I chose to integrate CCE’s clothes into CCA’s leveled lists rather than directly into Skyrim’s for two reasons:
  
A) I already use CCA and think it pairs nicely with CCE.
  
B) Using CCA’s leveled lists as a framework was the most straightforward way to distribute CCE’s new clothes to NPCs **without replacing vanilla clothes**.
  
More on that below: Spoiler
  

  
* The options to distribute the clothes through vanilla Skyrim level lists/outfit records are lackluster and trying to do so (without making a lot of edits and breaking compatibility with other mods) would result in vanilla clothes being completely replaced by CCE's new clothes.
CCA overhauls clothing distribution in Skyrim to allow for variation in outfits throughthe outfit records themselves containing level lists. **This means NPCs sharing the same outfit record can have different clothes by chance.** 
  
* Therefore, using CCA as a framework for a non-replacer distribution of CCE made the most sense to me as I already use CCA and didn't want to recreate it's functionality. As such, do not except a non-CCA version.
**Installation**
  
Simply install the main file with your preferred mod manager.
  
  
If you use [Fashions of the Fourth Era](https://sforzmods.tumblr.com/sse_fashions) (which is based on CCA) you should use [HSH SPCH - Common Clothing Expansion and FotFE Integration](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/134304) by [Hishigami](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/2977510) instead of my patch. It has identical functionality as my patch but for FotFE.
