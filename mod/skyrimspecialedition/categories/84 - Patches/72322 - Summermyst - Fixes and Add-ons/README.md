Summermyst is an amazing enchantment overhaul. In making patches for it I came across a few inconsistencies in the leveled lists it modifies. This mod aims to address all the inconsistencies in the leveled lists.
  
  
In addition I've also been patching a few mods to have Summermyst enchantments. I will be adding on to these as I go.
  
  
  
Main Plugin addresses these inconsistencies
  
  

  
* Added Summermyst's Orcish Battleaxe of Shock's variants to the proper leveled list. Previously it was added to a leveled list that isn't referenced by anything.
Added the proper Leveled List flags for Nordic Mace Fire's leveled list and Nordic War Axe Paralyze's leveled list following the other leveled lists (Calculate from all levels <= player and Calculate for each item in count)
  
* Created and distributed enchanted variants of Ancient Nord Swords and War Axes. Base Summermyst created enchanted variants of Ancient Nord War Axes but distributed them wrongly and never created enchanted variants of Ancient Nord Swords
Releveled all the imprison enchantments in Stalhrim,Ebony,Daedric leveled lists to follow the other enchantments
  
* Releveled all the items in Nordic Sword Absorb Magicka as they all were level 1 instead of levels 20,22 and 25 respectively for each enchantment strength
Removed the enchanted Ancient Nord Weapons from the Enchanted Nordic Leveled Lists for Greatsword of Fire and WarAxe of Frost
  
* Removed the Steel Weapon showing up once in every Iron Weapon Soul Trap leveled list and added it to the Steel Weapon Soul Trap leveled list
Replaced LItemEnchDaedricWeaponAny with USSEP's fix which makes it more compatible with other mods adding new types of enchantments
  
* Added Level 3 enchants to Glass Greatsword, Mace, War Axe and Warhammer of Magicka Leveled Lists
Corrected inconsistencies in Dwarven Warhammer and Dwarven War Axe's Absorb Health and Absorb Stamina Leveled Lists
  
* Removed enchanted Orcish Swords from the Enchanted Orcish Mace Leveled Lists

**Add-ons**Animated Armoury (Requires Main Plugin, CC Fishing Add-On and [Animated Armoury (DAR Version)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35978))

Fixed the Civil War Rewards for Stormcloaks to give a Nordic Sword instead of an Elven Sword
