**Description**If you try to get near (or any NPC) in the vicinity of the baths, they will automatically undress fully, but will redress back as they leave, this is just a simple patch for JK's interiors, please feel free to make suggestions about what to patch next that's JK, if there are any more baths that was added in that I missed.

(You could place the ESP anywhere, load order doesn't matter, it has custom form IDs and won't conflict with vanilla cell refs IDs, also it has no master files for further compatibility and can also work standalone, but if you don't have the required files obviously you won't be able to access the part of the area that JK had added in, he added new rooms that the baths would be placed in, so undress triggers I've placed wouldn't conflict with other cell editing mods, I can guarantee. Anyway, please consider endorsing if you like the mod and please feel free to suggest.)
