**At the end of the month I will be removing most of my patch files (Any that have this writing at the top of the page). It's partly because I want to concentrate on making followers, and actual mods, but mainly because I got a bit overwhelmed with the amount of updates to the mods involved, and ended up neglecting them. The latter is bad mod hosting practice, and I apologise sincerely for any inconvenience caused.**
  
  
**If anyone wants to take over any of the files, PM me, and I will sign them over to you. Any that aren't will be removed in early February.**
  
  
  
Thank you to agd25 for At Your Own Pace, DanielCoffey for Book Covers of Skyrim, kryptopyr for aMidianBorn Content Addon, Parapets for Save the Icerunner - Lights Out Alternate Routes, Dispensation for Quest NPCs Run, EnaiSiaion for Wintersun Faiths of Skyrim, and EpicCrab for Tactical Valtheim.
  
  
These are some small patches to solve conflicts with the plugins in AYOP and some other mods in my load order. 
  
  
AYOP Main ESP and Book Covers Skyrim - Gives one note that AYOP edits the intended appearance from BCS.
  
  
AYOP Main and Quest NPCs Run - Both mods edit a package given to Balgruuf. This patch combines those edits.
  
  
AYOP Misc and Save the Icerunner - AYOP edits Jaree by adding a condition that he only addresses your character if you have stolen items before, and it also makes him say the line once. This patch combines those edits with those made by Save the Icerunner.
  
  
AYOP Companions and aMidianBorn Content Addon - Both mods edit the Take Up Arms Quest. aMidianBorn changes the quest display text and the shield involved in the quest to an aMidianBorn model. **UPDATE - Added the changes from the last AYOP update.**
  
  
AYOP Companions and Radiant Blocker ESP from the mod Tactical Valtheim - Both mods edit three companion quests. This patch will ensure you don't get to sent to Valtheim after you've conquered it in any of them.
  
  
AYOP College and Radiant Blocker ESP from the mod Tactical Valtheim - Both mods edit a cow quest. This patch will ensure you don't get to sent to Valtheim in that quest after you've conquered it.
  
  
AYOP Thieves Guild and Quest NPCs Run - Both mods edit some packages given to Karliah. This patch combines those edits. **UPDATE - Added the changes from the last AYOP update.**
  
  
AYOP Thieves Guild and Wintersun - Both mods edit TG09 Darkness Returns and this patch combines those edits. **UPDATE - Added the changes from the last AYOP update.**
  
  
**NEW** - AYOP Thieves Guild and Inconspicuous NPC's - Both mods add key words to the Ragged Flagon, and the patch combines them.
  
  
They also conlicted with two other mods in my game but these were better resolved by load order. If you use Bards Reborn Student of Song Become a Bard Expansion with Bard Spells, load it after AYOP to give it priority. If you use Misc Dialogue Edits, load it before AYOP to give AYOP priority.
  
  
The patches are flagged as ESL and won't count towards your load order limit.
