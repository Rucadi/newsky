**Blackthorn Fishing Spots Patch**
  
  
I'm a huge fan of Blackthorn, but it's an older mod, and someone mentioned to me the other day that they wished it had some places to fish. So I made some.
  
  
**What this mod does:**
  
- Creates a permanent fishing spot on the riverbank east of Blackthorn town
  
- Once the dock is built, places a fishing spot and some clutter items (fishing rod, cleaning table, etc) on it
  
- Gives each fishing spot a follower and dog marker so your vanilla followers can comment on your fishing while your pet watches
  
- Optionally provides a discoverable map marker for the fishing spot on the dock, which includes integration into CoMap
  
  
**What this mod doesn't do:**
  
- Edit navmesh
  
- Edit the Blackthorn items or mechanics in any way
  
- Edit any CC fishing quests or locations
  
- Add any new fish, fishing dialogue, quests, or items
  
  
**Requirements:**
  
- CC fishing
  
- Blackthorn
  
- CoMap, if you want your fishing map marker to be a fish
  
- BEES if you are on an older version of Skyrim to handle the modern ESL format
