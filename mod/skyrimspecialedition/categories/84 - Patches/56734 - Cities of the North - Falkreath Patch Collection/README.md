It's me again, (well, US this time - very happy to be working with Czasior, ra2phoenix, and InstantKor to crank things out. Give 'em all some kudos and thanks in the comments! :) ) working at resolving potential conflicts with [Cities of the North - Falkreath](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56731). Each mod which has a patch is listed below, with specific details of all changes contained in spoilers, if necessary. All patches are ESP flagged as ESL, unless otherwise noted.
  
  
Please remember that patches sometimes involve Persistent references, so they will require a new save/playthrough. Before making a request for help, please double check that the problem exists on such a new save.
  
  
Gardden has already added COTN Falkreath to his [Great Cities of JK's North](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33687)﻿, so if you're using both of 'em, head on over there and get yourself taken care of!

*Installation*
  
Use a mod manager/organizer to install, or drop the loose files into your Skyrim data folder. Patches should have their appropriate masters set and should be loaded after any mods that they are patching. Some of the fixes in question are on persistent objects and may require a new save.
  
  
*Compatibility*
  
I don't believe this should introduce any incompatibilities beyond anything which may be present between base mods. All moved objects should have been moved to non-overlapping locations. Let me know if you hit anything.
