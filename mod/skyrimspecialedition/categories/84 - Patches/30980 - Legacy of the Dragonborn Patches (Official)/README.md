If you encounter any errors with the FOMOD or patches contained here please let us know either here on the comments page (preferred), the official Mod page, or on the discord server,  so that the issues can be looked at in a timely manner.
  
  
  
Notes:
  
  
Patches provided here are tested with the mod identified and Legacy of the Dragonborn on an individual basis.  It is simply impossible to test all the various permutations of these patches against other patches (here or elsewhere) or other mods not identified below.  As such, it is the user's responsibility to check for overall compatibility within their entire load order and provide their own conflict resolution where appropriate.
  
  
Do NOT use version 5 patches with a version 6 game!  If you had a v5 patch for something, and it is no longer offered, it means the patch is no longer needed, support for the mod has been dropped, or the patch was created by the mod author and is being managed on their page.
