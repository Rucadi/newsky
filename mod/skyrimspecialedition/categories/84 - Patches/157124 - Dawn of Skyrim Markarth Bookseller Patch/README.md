# Dawn of Skyrim Markarth Bookseller Patch

Background
  
I use a combination of Dawn of Skyrim and JK's Skyrim, along with its combo patches and combo patches with Lux. I noticed that Ginerva, the book merchant added by Dawn of Skyrim, would literally never offer her "What do you have for sale?" dialog option, despite the fact that she would spend the whole day chilling next to her stall. Similarly, I noticed that Beirand, the blacksmith in Solitude, would mill around his smithy, sometimes using the grindwheel, sometimes the armor table, sometimes the forge, etc, but if he ever went to the smelter, he would also not offer his merchant dialog. And he can spend hours at a time dicking around the smelter.
  
  
The Issue
  
It seems like these city overhaul mods add markers in places or change existing markers (Ginerva's original vendor stall in DoS is closer to the main entrance door, and in JK's+DoS, it's further back, below your house), but left the vendor marker in its original place, and didn't edit the distance they could be away from that original vendor marker while still offering their merchant services. All I've done is increase the radius.
  
  
Compatibility & Requirements
  
This only edits the location radius in Dawn of Skyrim, so only Dawn of Skyrim is required. In theory, this patch should be compatible with any or all combinations of Dawn of Skyrim plus any other city overhaul mod/mods, as long as her vendor stall is still in the same general vicinity and the resulting combination of mods didn't leave her original vendor marker in place, then move her book stall to inside Understone Keep or something. Also compatible with any NPC replacers or AI mods, because I'm not editing any NPC records.
  
  
Three versions are available, one that edits just the radius of Ginerva's marker, one that edits just Beirand's marker, and one that edits both. Beirand's marker doesn't require any dependencies, and should also be compatible with any combination of city overhauls.
  
  
Safe to install or remove mid-save.
