# Immersive College of Winterhold Patch Collection

Been a while since it's been a new one of these, huh? Well, not for a new mod, but rather the grand old [Immersive College of Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17004)﻿! While working on the JKs College of Winterhold - ICOW patch (which is currently in beta), I realized it'd be a good idea to get a baseline expectation of what combo patches would be needed, which led to this. Each mod which has a patch is listed below, with specific details of all changes contained in spoilers, if necessary. All patches are ESP flagged as ESL, unless otherwise noted.
  
  
Please remember that patches sometimes involve Persistent references, so they will require a new save/playthrough. Before making a request for help, please double check that the problem exists on such a new save.
  
  
Additionally, please note that an SFCO patch already exists [on the SFCO patch page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62867)﻿, many patches (ELFX, etc) are already included with ICOW itself, Miscellaneous College of Winterhold Tweaks already contains an ICOW version for Early Elementalist, and LOTD already has a patch for ICOW.
  
  
Additionally, ICOW already has patches for Cutting Room Floor and M'rissi, but I already made new ones before I realized it and I like how mine are implemented, so nyah. They won't be included in the FOMOD, but they'll be on the optional page :P
  
  
  
If anyone is using [Ultimate College of Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44797) in combo with Obscure's, I have no idea how these work with that - they're likely unnecessary and could otherwise cause problems.
  
  
If using ICOW in tandem with JK's College of Winterhold, [use the patches in this linked patch collection](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67820) instead of﻿ any of the patches on this page.
  
  
  
*Included Patch Descriptions*
  
  
Unofficial Immersive College of Winterhold Patch - While making this, I came across a few things which I felt I could clean up. USSEP is a master to ICOW and added some mage gloves since ICOW was made (I assume) and some of them were clipping into furniture. Any cases needed were moved. USSEP also adds some weapon rack stuff in the archmage's quarter which could be interacted with despite the display being disabled by ICOW, so I disable those too. A number of activators in the Hall of Countenance weren't aligned with their plaques which was kinda weird (I remembered this from playing it), so they're all shifted. The navmesh in the Arcaneum was a bit off, so I cleaned that up a smidge (all markers added by ICOW should be reachable now), at one point Update.esm updated one of the containers that ICOW touches so that change is forwarded, and finally there was some exterior navmesh where one cell looks like ICOW's changes got overwritten accidentally at some point (edges weren't aligning, etc), and I cleaned it up. If using this, make sure it loads right after ICOW (it should be treated as a direct update to it). None of these patches DIRECTLY conflict with its changes except for Royal Armory Tweaks, but best to be on the safe side. This was last checked against version 6.2 of ICOW.
  
  
  
[3DNPCs/Interesting NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194) - shifts one indoor reference marker to match new interior, and shifts the ENTIRE bit of Gorr/Zora's quest outside Skytemple Ruins to the other side of the ruins. It was theoretically possible to have the ruins destroyed by ICOW's quest simultaneous with that thing playing out which....honestly, would have been borderline hilarious. Anyway, it *should* play out alright, but on the icy cliff behind the temple. Let me know if you run into trouble. Last checked against version 4.4
  
  
[Additional Hearthfire Dolls](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46930) - Shifts two placed dolls to match new interiors. Last checked against version 3
  
  
[AI Overhaul SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21654) - Redo of the existing patch from [this page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41694?tab=description ), with a focus more on shifting instead of disabling, and includes the latest package updates and whatnot. Last checked against version 1.7, yes, it will work with either version, no you don't need Fishing. Additional combo versions with CRF and SEF are available.
  
  
[Amorous Adventures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7305) - CR on the player's bed. Last checked against version 3.4. As far as I'm aware, should work with any version
  
  
[Amulets of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/487) - Moves a few amulets to their appropriate locations in the new interiors. Last checked against version 4.061
  
  
[Animated Armory (DAR Edition)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35978) - Shifts a bunch of the placed books to match the new interior. I opted to make a new one from scratch instead of updating the one from [this page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63365?tab=description), as they noted they disabled all the books and added to the inventory instead. Last checked against version 2.3
  
  
Artifacts of Skyrim  - Artifacts adds a whole structure on top of the mound at Skytemple Ruins, which Immersive College of Winterhold also edits. The result is rather unsightly and there's a lot of object collision. Disabled the Artifacts edits in favor of Immersive College of Winterhold's. After all, during the Fall of Winterhold quest,
  
  
Spoilera dragon emerges from there, which would be hard to do with all that stuff in the way.
  
  
Helm of Yglar has been moved to compensate for this, it's next to the chest in the Skytemple Ruins. The patch also relocates the Provincial Artifacts - Volume IV, Skyrim book so it's no longer on the ground of the Arcanaeum. Latest version was the last one released, but this mod no longer looks available so.....sorry?
  
  
[BadGremlin's Collection AIO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15092) - Moves a placed jar and book to appropriate locations in the new interior. Last checked against version SE1
  
  
[Cassandra Frost Witch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4783) - Shifts book to not conflict with other objects. Note this is for the original mod, I'm sure there's like 50 versions out there some of which are compacted. If you note that your game is crashing with patches installed, my first response is going to be to screenshot this section of the description and post it in reply to you. Last checked against version 3.
  
  
[Cathedral 3D Mountain Flowers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41312)﻿ - CR on a single reference in Windhelm. Last checked against version 1.8
  
  
[Cheesemod for EVERYONE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36506) - Shifts a few added cheeses to match the new interior, CR on a number of references. Last checked against version 1.01
  
  
[Cloaks of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6369) - Moves placed cloaks and spinning wheel into to (at least somewhat) appropriate locations in the new interiors. Last checked against version 1.2.1
  
  
[Containers and Levelled List Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26575) - CR on 5 containers. Combo version with Tamrielic Culture also available. Last checked against version 1.2.5
  
  
[COTN Dawnstar](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28952) - Finally got off my ass and made these. Makes the scrying feature look at the new throne location instead of the void. I think. This will get uploaded into the other patch collection too, but will be the same file. Last checked against version 1.2.1
  
  
[COTN Falkreath](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56731) - Finally got off my ass and made these. Makes the scrying feature look at the new throne location instead of the void. I think. This will get uploaded into the other patch collection too, but will be the same file. Last checked against version 1.2
  
  
[COTN Morthal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34168) - Finally got off my ass and made these. Makes the scrying feature look at the new throne location instead of the void. I think. This will get uploaded into the other patch collection too, but will be the same file. Last checked against version 1.1
  
  
[COTN Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40088) - Finally got off my ass and made these. Makes the scrying feature look at the new throne location instead of the void. I think. This will get uploaded into the other patch collection too, but will be the same file. Last checked against version 1.1
  
  
Creation Club Gray Cowl Returns - Re-enables the Gray Fox's gravestone that ICOW disables and moves it slightly, and moves the Stranger's Journal so that the quest can be completed
  
  
Creation Club Wild Horses - Shifts placement of a journal to match interior, also shifts spawn point of a unicorn to be on navmesh. Does CC have version numbers?
  
  
[Cutting Room Floor](https://www.afkmods.com/index.php?/files/file/1894-cutting-room-floor/) - When making this, rather than trying to get stuff to work in the Hall of Countenance, my brain went "man, there's a bunch of unused beds
  
over in the Hall of Attainment, let's just use that, since it'd also circumvent the conflict with M'rissi." So I did that! Orthorn moves into the basement in that hall instead. Also, combo patch with AIO exists. Last checked against version 3.1.11
  
  
[Elder Scrolls Online Imports](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11729) - CR on a bunch of references (mostly alcohol which ICOW disables), changes a few newly placed alcohol to be the new ESO types, too. Last checked against version 8.1
  
  
[Enhanced Landscapes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18162) - Disables/shifts some mountain peaks to not overlap with stuff added near the secret hideout. Last checked against version 2.0.
  
  
[Improved College Entry: Questline Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22184) - CR on one ref to make sure it stays disabled since ICOW removes it. Last checked against version 2.8
  
  
[JK's Blue Palace](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45324) - Finally got off my ass and made these. Makes the scrying feature look at the new throne location instead of the void. I think. This will get uploaded into the other patch collection too, but will be the same file. Last checked against version 1.2.2
  
  
[JK's Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6289) - Shifts a bunch of little stuff near some of the teleport markers so they're still accessible/don't have stuff growing through them. Last checked against version 1.7
  
  
[Khajiit Will Follow](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2227) - Shifst Chaturjo to not clip through some added aesthetics from ICOW. Last checked against version 4.6.1
  
  
[Konahrik Accoutrements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22206) - Moves The Dragon Forge book upstairs, so that it's no longer laying on the floor in the Arcanaeum. Moves the Scroll of Abjuration in the Hall of Countenance to Colette Marence's room on her desk, so that it's no longer clipping inside of a shelf. Last checked against version 5.5.3
  
  
[Lanterns of Skyrim II](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30817) - CR on one or two lights, disables and rotates some of the blowing snow FX because LoS II had them going at like 90 degree angles to what ICOW added and it looked funny. Last checked against version 4
  
  
[Marshlands](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23062) - Disables one tree that was growing through the Morthal teleport marker. Last checked against version 1.
  
  
[Miscellaneous College of Winterhold Tweaks: Governable Gatekeeper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22653) - Since I'm making this page anyway, instead of requiring you to do load order, I made them load order agnostic following the instructions on that page. Last checked against version 1.5.1
  
  
[Morrowloot Ultimate](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3058) - Shifts some placed clothes and other objects to match new interior. Additionally, CR on Ancano's NPC base. Combo version with SRCEO available. Last checked against version 1.57
  
  
[Morrowloot Miscellania](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27094) - Same as the above, except without the Ancano's NPC base change, as MLM's touching this ref is ITPO (it does not give him a daedric dagger). Thus, combo patch with SRCEO is not necessary. Load ICOW after MLM, tho (or clean MLM). Last checked against version 1.3
  
  
[M'rissi's Tails of Trouble](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9666) - When making this, rather than trying to get stuff to work in the Hall of Countenance, my brain went "man, there's a bunch of unused beds over in the Hall of Attainment, let's just use that, since it'd also circumvent the conflict with CRF." So I did that! Additionally, updated a package and two quests to point to the new bed. There's also a bunch of stuff that M'rissi stuck outside the wall for some reason which....I don't really think has any purpose for existing, but I left it alone, outside the new wall. There's a lot of weird stuff this mod does like changing scale of some things to 0 so they're the size of an atom. Anyway, it should all work. Last checked against version 1.7
  
  
[Mystic Condenser](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10176) - Fixes placement of the Mystic Condenser, navmesh conflict. Last checked against version 2.3.
  
  
[Mysticism](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839) - CR on containers, shifts one placed spellbook. Last checked against version 2.0.6
  
  
[Not so Fast Mage's Guild](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5686) - Package combination for ICOW and NSF-MG so Ancano goes to ICOW's marker, but not until NSF-MG says to. Last checked against version 1.4. And after having made this one, someone keyed me in to [this one](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18731), which I somehow missed. It looks like there may be more to this one, so I'd recommend using that one until I have a chance to look into what it does (I might take mine down)
  
  
[Palaces and Castles Enhanced](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1819) - Finally got off my ass and made these. Makes the scrying feature look at the new throne location instead of the void. I think. This will get uploaded into the other patch collection too, but will be the same file. Last checked against version 2.3
  
  
[Quaint Raven Rock](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20851) - CR on some ash, shifts one other ash pile so it doesn't completely cover the teleport marker. This will get uploaded into the other patch collection too, but will be the same file. Last checked against version 1.7.1
  
  
[Radiance Locations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45419) - CR on two refs and a location. Last checked against version 1.0.1.
  
  
[Royal Armory Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26398) - re-enables a disabled display case and puts it in an appropriate spot. Last checked against version 1.40
  
  
[Sepolcri](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34105) - Shifts a few markers to work properly with the teleport marker. Will work with the Sepolcri - JKs Skyrim patch. Last checked against version 1.2
  
  
[Skyrim Immersive Creatures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12680) - Shifts one placed book to match new interior of Arcaneum. Last checked against version 7.0.2
  
  
[Skyrim Revamped: Complete Enemy Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14598) - CR on Ancano's NPC base. Generally speaking, the higher number on any stat was chosen (you're playing on SRCEO), any spells/perks got forwarded, packages from ICOW, and skills from SRCEO were chosen. Last checked against version 2.45
  
  
[Skyrims Unique Treasures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5261) - Shifts placed object to match new interior. Last checked against version 4.4
  
  
[Special Edition Followers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7622) - CR with ICOW on Onmund, J'zargo, and Brelyna. Generally speaking, ICOW won packages, outfit, and skills, SEF won class and max level, any perks got forwarded from both. Combo version with AIO available. Last checked against version 1.01
  
  
[Tamrielic Culture](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11418) - Shifts newly placed references in the Arcanaeum and the Arch-Mage's Quarters to match the new interior, as well as CR on one container. Combo patch with CLLF which contains changes of both included. Last checked against version 2
  
  
[Tools of Kagrenac](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14168) - Shifts placed references and objects to match new interior, disables placed bed which is redundant because ICOW adds so many. Last checked against version 1.59
  
  
[Weapons Armor Clothing and Clutter Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18994) - CR on the Archmage's Robes and outfit, CR on a bunch of stuff in the Hall of Attainment, "No Respawn" flag added to the added user room stuff from ICOW to match WACCF, and CR on the archmage's stuff. Verified with Monops that it's okay for the things referred to by the WACCF startup quest to be disabled. Last checked against version 2.8
  
  
[WACCF - Armor and Clothing Extension](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19002) - CR on stuff that ACE changes. Last checked against version 1.3
  
  
[Your Choices Matter - A Dark Brotherhood Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46871) - From the sticky, the included patch which uses a script doesn't always seem to work. This is CR and a tweak to a quest to do what the script was supposed to. It's explicitly for version 2.0.6 and isn't guaranteed to work on updates, since they're trying to get the script to work right.
  
  
Other mods I'm aware of: [Here There Be Monsters: Call of Cthulhu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63367)
  
  
*Installation*
  
Use a mod manager/organizer to install, or drop the loose files into you Skyrim data folder. Patches should have their appropriate masters set, and should be loaded after any mods which they are patching. Some of the fixes in question are on persistent objects, and may require a new save.
  
  
*Compatibility*
  
I don't believe this should introduce any incompatibilities beyond anything which may be present between base mods. All moved objects should have been moved to locations which are non-overlapping. Let me know if you hit anything.
