**Overview**
  
  
[Talkative Dragons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26955) is a mod that gives dragons combat dialogue. [Skyrim Immersive Creatures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12680)﻿ adds a new dragon type - Dwarven Mechanical Dragons.
  
  
From using these two mods, I found that it's a bit immersion-breaking to hear mechanical dragons have the same combat lines and voice as regular, alive dragons, so I made this patch. But then again, mechanical dragons aren't a super lore-friendly addition, so if you don't think the voice is a problem, then this patch isn't for you :)
  
  
Requires **Skyrim Immersive Creatures**. Technically doesn't require Talkative Dragons, but it would be useless without it
  
  
And if you're using Skyrim Immersive Creatures, be sure you're using the [Official Patch and Patch Central](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18639)
  
**Problem**
  
 **Talkative Dragons** gives dragons their combat dialogue by checking for the "crDragonVoice" voice type. **Skyrim Immersive Creatures**'s mechanical dragons have the "crDragonVoice" voice type.
  
  
**Solution**
  
  
Removed the "crDragonVoice" type from SIC's "Dwarven Mechanical Dragon" records. I know, it's crazy!
  
  
  
There shouldn't be any problems, so let me know if you have any. Patch is ESL-flagged, so it won't take up a spot in your load order
