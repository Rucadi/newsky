[[color=#93c47d]Fortune's Tradehouse](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22755)[/color]
  
~~[DoubtSuspended](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/4975440) made an excellent quest mod called [Fortune's Tradehouse](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22755), though some may find it lacking in interior design. I tried my best to spice it up a bit and make it a nice place to revisit. There are some screenshots provided.~~

  
* ~~There are also some reports of navmesh issues. I've done my best to fix the problem, and I now have no issues on my end.~~

Version 2.0 of Fortune's Tradehouse includes a fix for the exterior navmesh; therefore, I will be moving my fix here to the [old](https://tenor.com/view/press-f-to-pay-respect-press-f-f-to-pay-respect-pay-respect-meme-gif-22107222)﻿ files.
  
  
Animated Whistling - Press H to Horse Patch
  
~~This patch replaces some scripts to add the animation of calling your horse (normally or through the UIExtensions menu) and telling it to wait.~~[Press H to Horse](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81195?tab=description) now has patchless support for Animated Whistling as of v1.0.4.1. If, for some reason, you don't want to update, my patch is found in the old files.
  
Thanks to [TateTaylorOH](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/61720101) for the easiest horse overhaul I've ever used and [TheCyclist](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/103085918) for their incredible animation work.
  
  
Rodryk's Dragon Bridge - Great Cities Patch - cale's Edit
  
Originally I was going to create my own patch from scratch, but [skyfall515's](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/41181730) [patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42619) between the two pretty much covered everything I wanted, so I just ended up using that instead, except I also made a few changes. I removed the two inside gates to sort of make the roads more spacious, and I took the blacksmith's house and gave it a makeover using Rodryk's assets. No more vanilla farmhouse. I also fixed the navmesh on the road to Solitude, so there's no need for [this](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61447) fix. Screenshots are provided.
  
***REQUIREMENTS***

JK's and Redbag's Dragonsreach Patch - cale's Edit
  
This is nearly identical to [this](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45686) patch. Because I used it as a base to make mine, it doesn't require that patch at all. It's an either-or situation. I only wanted a few changes, so that's what I did. Mainly, I removed the second dragon skull that Redbag's plugin adds and the Jarl's little pedestal. I thought it looked a little weird, so I restored the original one. I also removed the fences that JK's plugin adds around the fire. I thought it was weird for there to be wood so close to an open fire, and I also wanted Redbag's custom fireplace to pop out more. That's all. Screenshots are provided.
