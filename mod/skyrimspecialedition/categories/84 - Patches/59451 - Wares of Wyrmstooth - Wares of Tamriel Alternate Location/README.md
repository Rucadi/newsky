# Wares of Wyrmstooth - Wares of Tamriel Alternate Location
- Author: Jelidity
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59451


This mod is a relatively simple patch to revert all changes made to Dawnstar to its vanilla state and provide an alternative location for the docking of the ship added by [Beyond Skyrim: Wares of Tamriel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31519) in [Wyrmstooth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45565)'s Stonehollow.﻿
  
  
The Dawn's Venture will not arrive at the docks until Stonehollow has begun its rebuilding process.
  
  
**Load Order:**
  
In order to make sure your Dawnstar setup functions as you would expect, ensure that your load order follows this pattern:
  
  

  
* BeyondSkyrimMerchant.esp (Wares of Tamriel)
WaresOfWyrmstooth.esp (This mod)
  
* Other Dawnstar Overhauls

  
With this mod installed, you do not need to install any patches for Dawnstar mods and Wares of Tamriel.
  
  
**Compatibility:**
  
As stated above, this shouldn't cause any problems if the above load order rule is followed.
  
  
Incompatible with my othe mod of this type: [Wares of Haafingaar Expanded - Wares of Tamriel Alternate Location](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35356). Choose one or the other.
  
  
**Thanks:**
