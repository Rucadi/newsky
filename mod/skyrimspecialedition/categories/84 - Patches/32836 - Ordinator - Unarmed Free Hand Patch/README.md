FAQS**[/font][font=Verdana]
  
  
**Q**: What does this mod do?
  
**A**: It allows you a free hand to use on other things if you use the ordinator unarmed perks. Magic, shields, staves, and torches.
  
**Q**: What makes this mod different from Drask's mod?
  
**A**: Drask's mod overwrites the ordinator mod itself where as this one is a patch. Drask's mod lets you use weapons and unarmed where as mine doesn't allow melee weapons. Drask's version is outdated and isn't compatible with the current version of ordinator because it replaces the entire esp, so you're stuck deciding between using an old version of ordinator if you want drask's changes or using the current version without them. Mine doesn't suffer from that issue.

**Q**: Why did you make this mod?
  
**A**: I wanted to make a khajiit monk and I couldn't find another mod that did what I wanted so I made my own.
  
**Q**: Is this in esl format?
  
**A**: Yes.
  
  
**Q**: Will you port this to oldrim?
  
**A**: No. You can do it though. Just look at what I did and make the changes yourself, it's a few easy steps.[/font]
