It's me again, working at resolving potential conflicts with [Cities of the North - Morthal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34168). PLEASE check the sticky on the posts tab, please bear with me, and I hope you enjoy. Each mod which has a patch is listed below, with specific details of all changes contained. All patches are ESP flagged as ESL, unless otherwise noted. I'm certainly more experienced than last time, but I'm still a relative novice, so if you run into trouble, please let me know.

[Enhanced Lights and FX](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2424) ﻿- Two patches. one more planned. Exclusive Patch has all of COTN - Morthal's changes to lights/objects forwarded, and removes all references added by ELFX, which will give you the exact lighting intended by COTN Morthal. Inclusive Patch attempts to replicate the intention behind ELFX to the new interiors, however, due to engine limitations compromises needed to be made in two of the buildings. Last checked against version 3.06.

In some cases, original markers are restored and moved to locations where new markers had been placed in COTN Morthal. Please note that all changes here are subjective on my part, and may not reflect the vision of the original mod.

Other patch option available over [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42423?)﻿, and that MA is more familiar with Immersive Laundry than I am, so I'd err towards using his.
  
  
[Immersive Patrols](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/718) - moves an X-Marker used for wandering patrols to be back within the bounds of the Moorside Inn. Last checked against version 2.2.3. NOT NEEDED WITH VERSION 3+, REMOVED FROM FOMOD. Old version still available in the old versions section.

[JK's Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6289) - combines the changes of both mods. In addition to this, the enterprising [Gardden has an all-in-one patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33687) for both COTN mods, JKs AIO, and The Great Cities All-in-One at the above link. If you want your all-in-one, please check out their page - I won't be making a separate one. They were kind enough to let me take that one and apply the same changes to just The Great City of Morthal, for people who choose to use the stand-alone. I made a couple of further tweaks (including interiors, etc), and that patch can be found here.
  
  
[Kaidan 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19075) - Shifts a couple placed objects in Falion's house to match the new interior. Last checked against version 2.1.1

[Lanterns of Skyrim II](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30817) ﻿- Two patches available - one base one, one additional one to resolve a conflict between JKs patches, if you're using JKs. In that case, correct load order: COTN Morthal - JKs Skyrim Patch, LoS II - JKs Skyrim Patch, COTN Morthal - JKs Skyrim - LoS II Patch. COTN Morthal - Lanterns of Skyrim II Patch is still needed in that case, but can be loaded anywhere. Last checked against v2.1
  
  
[Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802) ﻿- Surprisingly little. Moves the amulet/gem/markers in Falion's House to match the interior, moves fliers/drunk marker/gems in Moorside Inn to match new interior. Forwards a little conflict resolution, and removes some added barrels/etc which conflicted with the mailing crates.

[Mihail's Handicapped Citizens](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63235) - moves all added elements to a different spot. Last checked against version 1.1
  
  
[Morrowloot Ultimate](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3058) ﻿- same changes as the previous, but with a couple additional items which aren't included in Miscellania, as well. As I don't use this, I've been going off the changelog rather than looking explicitly.
  
  
[Morthal Overhaul II](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17536) - Applies the COTN Morthal aesthetics to the Morthal Overhaul layout. Last checked against version 1.0
  
  
[Morthal Tree Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23866) - shifts one tree, removes a couple others to allow tree placement to work with COTN. Slight clipping, but nothing of consequence, with JKs. Last checked against version 1.

[Open Civil War](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11076) - Moves a set stage trigger back over the opening of The Highmoon Hall entrance, matching the new layout. Patch was generated for revision

Load order matters here, due to compatibility patches which conflict with one another. Load COTN/RRR in any order relative to one another, then all RRR patches, then the COTN - RRR patch, and finally all other COTN compatibility patches. Behavior will be potentially erratic otherwise. Last checked against version 1.8.9.001.

[World Assets Recycle Project](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28228) - Moves objects/references to match new interiors/exteriors. Due to nature of the changes (they're all things which factor only after quests are completed), it is not explicitly tested and should be considered in beta. Based on v1.01a.
  
  
Other patches I'm aware of: [Combo patch with Skyrim Bridges for various city mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57001), [Simplicity of Snow](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58559), [Skyrim Unbound Reborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68994), [Mihail's Crows](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/104487)
  
*Installation*
  
Use a mod manager/organizer to install, or drop the loose files into your Skyrim data folder. Patches should have their appropriate masters set, and should be loaded after any mods which they are patching. Some of the fixes in question are on persistent objects, and may require a new save.
  
  
*Compatibility*
  
I don't believe this should introduce any incompatibilities beyond anything which may be present between base mods. Let me know if you hit anything.
