**This patches the location of the CC Fishing Supplies at the Solitude docks to work with the [Great City of Solitude](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22243)﻿.**
  
It simply moves the fishing supplies on the nearest dock, nothing else is changed.
  
  
This can be installed on an existing save, but the fish that spawn with the fishing supplies will remain at their original location.
  
A new save, however, will have the updated location.
  
  
This doesn't touch the Great City of Solitude, so in an untested theory it could be used for other Solitude mods if the docks are in the right place.
  
  
ESL flagged ESP to save those slots.
