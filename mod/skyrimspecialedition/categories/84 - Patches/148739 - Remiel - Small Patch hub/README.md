Remiel - Combat Style Tweaks:Aimed at normalizing Remiel's combat AI when using NPC Spell Variance or something similar;However,you don't have to have those spell variance mods to use this.Compatible with Remiel Enhancement.Load it after Enhancement.Remiel's intension to use melee and ranged weapons increase while the ranged intension is more than melee intension;Magic intension has been halfly reduced.
  
  
Remiel Hates Magic:Only when you have NPC Spell Variance(or similar mods distributing spells to her.Work with my combat style tweaks.This mod actually blocks Remiel from casting any magic except summoning spider.Should have a custom patch for your own appearance replacer.Provided an alternate version for Remiel's Enhancement.
