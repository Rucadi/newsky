This patch resolves conflicts with Bloodchill Manor's entrance
  
  
**REQUIREMENTS:**
  

  
* Skyrim Anniversary Edition (or just Bloodchill Manor from Creation Club)
Majestic Mountains (any kind, any version)
  

  
  
**INSTALLATION:**
  

  
* Install via the mod manager of your choice, to manually control load order
Make sure this patch loads after **MajesticMountains\_Landscape.esm** 
  
(I put it after MajesticMountains**.esp** just because I like things to be ordered)* Re-run DynDoLod if you use it

  
**Another solutions:**
  
For anyone who uses **Majestic Mountains** and **Enhanced Landscapes**, instead of using this patch, try this: <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72618>
