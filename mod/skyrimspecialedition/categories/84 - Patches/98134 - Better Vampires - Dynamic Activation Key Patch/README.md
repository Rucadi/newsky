This patch adds the Dynamic activation key function to the sneak feeding and sneak extracting blood potions from Better Vampires.
  
  
I mainly made this mod to fix issues I had with using Dynamic Activation Key together with Better Vampires. As it would open the dialogue box before opening the actors inventory to steal items. File is ESPFE.
  
  
**You need to stand and use the DAK hotkey for feeding and if you sneak and use the DAK hotkey you will get the option to extract blood potion, if you have it enabled in your settings from Better Vampires.**
  
  
If you have any requests for other features from Better Vampires to be added so you have to use the Dynamic Activation Key to use them, let me know and I'll consider patching it as well :)
  
  
**Not compatible with Vampire Feeding Tweaks.**
