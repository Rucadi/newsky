**What does this mod do?**
  
  
This mod converts the dialogue option for hug which used a vanilla animation, to one that starts OStim scene. I have used the original voicelines included in the mod for the responses. I have changed the text accordingly. I can make an integration that also includes an option for hug if that is wanted. This will obviously only work when daumbra is in a body as no one has made sword animations yet :). 
  
  
This mod **requires** OStim Standalone and its dependencies. It will not work without it. Load this patch after the main quest mod.
