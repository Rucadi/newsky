Patches for [Wyrmstooth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45565) to fix some compatibility issues I've run into while testing. Here are the patches available so far and what they do:
  
  
**Crates:**
  
Removes the alternate textures from Wyrmstooth's crates to fix texture issues when used together with a mod like [ALT - Crates](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93482) that replace the models with ones that are incompatible with vanilla textures.
  
  
**EECO building:**
  
Modifies the navmesh inside and around the building at the Imperial Docks to fit the new model from [FYX - Eastern Empire Company Building](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86526). Requires the aforementioned mod.
  
  
**Installation:**
  
The FOMOD will suggest patches based on mods found in your LO, but user discretion is advised.
