Updates meshes to have more accurate collision ... for Capital Whiterun Expansion. Crazy right? Like the title directly relates to what the mod does. Exactly. 100%. All of it.
  
  
I mean, I also added a missing thingy on one mesh (pictured). So that's a thing. So maybe not 100%. But like, 100% of you should like it. I like it. I hope you like it. I like Capital Whiterun Expansion. Still holding out for Capital Riften Expansion. Please notice us Surjamte senpai.
