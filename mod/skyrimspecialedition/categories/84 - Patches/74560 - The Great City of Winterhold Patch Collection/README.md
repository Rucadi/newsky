[Cities of the North: Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40088) - Jeledity's heresy. It preserves TGC's general city layout and adds Jarl's castle from COTN on top, changing TGC's Wintershus Castle into guards barracks. All other patches are available (if needed) also in the versions dedicated to working with this one. Last checked against version 1.1
  
  
[Cloaks of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6369) - moves three placed cloaks to appropriate locations in the new interiors. Last checked against version 1.2.1
  
  
[Clockwork](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4155) - Navmesh CR patch. If using a college/city layout mod, load that patch below this one to get the appropriate navmesh for your layout. The chamber won't be tied into the navmesh in those cases, but NPCs don't use the path so that's fine, and it'd be borderline meaningless to make separate patch versions for each permutation. Last checked against version 1.0

[Curse of Akavir - Phoe SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17469) - Shifts an NPC and a few xmarker headings to match the new interior/exterior. Last checked against version 9.11
  
  
[Dawnguard Sentires Plus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13547) - modifies two NPCs spawning points and placement of patrol markers. Last checked against version 1.1c
  
  
[Distinct Interiors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6130) - Combines changes from TGCW and Distinct Interiors for the Inn. Last checked against version 1.82
  
  
[DootY](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34634) - moves outhouses to different spots, and modifies their texture sets. Last checked against version 4.
  
  
[Drunks of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22392) - Shifts a marker and an NPC spawn point. Last checked against version 10.2.1.7
  
  
[Dwemer Colosseum](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4435)﻿ - Shifts the anchor and teleport location a bit so it doesn't clip through buildings. Also, make sure to load DC before TGCW, otherwise there's tons of navmesh conflict - I didn't want to patch for it because it's all meaningless and that portion of the conflict goes away if you clean DC. Last checked against version 1.7
  
  
[DX Ursine Armor Pack UNP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3905) - shifts book position. Last checked against version 2.0

[Expanded Winterhold Ruins](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4299)﻿ - CR on a ton of stuff, disabled a buuuuuuuuuuunch of things added by Expanded Winterhold Ruins which clashed with the layout/aesthetics of TGCW (but kept a few because I personally thought they looked neat/didn't interfere), tied the navmesh for the two entrances (one at the base of the cliff, one to the hall of the dead) and shifted it slightly to match the new layout.

***Installation***
  
Use a mod manager/organizer to install, or drop the loose files into your Skyrim data folder.
  
Patches should have their appropriate masters set and be loaded after any mods they patch. Some of the fixes in question are on persistent objects and may require a new save.
  
  
  
***Compatibility***
  
- I don't believe this should introduce any incompatibilities beyond anything which may be present between base mods. All moved objects should have been moved to non-overlapping locations. Let us know if you hit anything.
  
- COTN versions of the patches aren't compatible with corresponding ones from [Cities of the North - Winterhold Patch Collection](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40181). **Do not install any of them with TGC / COTN Winterhold combination.**- **If you use [Cities of the North Optimized Meshes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85242), load it BEFORE this patch collection.**
  
  
  
***Load order***
  
1) Main patch for Cities of the North: Winterhold (TGCotN Winterhold)
  
2) Most of the patches
  
3) Snazzy Interiors and/or Keep It Clean patches
  
4) Outlaw Refuges patch (if used with JK's Skyrim, TGC - Outlaw Refuges patch must be loaded **after** the JK's Skyrim - Outlaw Refuges patch from JK's Skyrim page)
  
5) College of Winterhold Quest Expansion patch
  
6) Sounds of Skyrim patches
