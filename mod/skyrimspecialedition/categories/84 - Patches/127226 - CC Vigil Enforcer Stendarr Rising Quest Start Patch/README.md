# CC Vigil Enforcer Stendarr Rising Quest Start Patch
- Author: Susoheit

The Quest Unholy Vigil can be started by reading one of two letters, the first letter in the interior hall of the vigilant cell prior to dawnguard being triggered, the second after dawnguard has been triggered in the ruins of the hall of the vigilant. If you fix the hall of the vigilant as part of stendarr rising then neither of these letters are accessible, this mod adds a third letter inside the repaired hall of the vigilants so you can still start the quest.
  
  
This mod is not recommend to be installed mid-game and will likely be incompatible with any other mods that make edits to the "unholy vigil" quest (though I'm not aware of any currently existing).
