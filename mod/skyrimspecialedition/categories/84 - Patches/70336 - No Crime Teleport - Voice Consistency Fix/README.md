This mod updates the voice and lip files for guards during the arrest dialogue where you choose to pay your fine. They will no longer reference going to another location. This mod has no dependencies, so you can use this to make the dialogue shorter if you want. Though, it was meant to be paired with any combination of the following mods:

So like, anyways, that's it. Thank you for reading. If you have a dog or cat pet give them a treat for me <3 (full disclosure: this is a bribe so your pet will endorse this mod).
  
  
Also maybe check out my other stuff. I'm all over the place so I've prolly got something else you'll want. Khajiit has wares if you have endorsements.
