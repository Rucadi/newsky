[Interesting NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194)added one of my favorite characters ever, **Mugnor**. But when using with [Obscure's College of Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20514), she gets stuck on the same room, not interacting with anything around her properly.
  
  
**This mods fixes her references for sandbox behaviour, and lets her roam around beyond that little space.**
  
If you are still getting her stuck near the enchanting table and the bookshelf, trough console *disable* her and then *enable* her, and the fix should apply properly. 
  
  
In the future, I would like to add more behaviours to her so she feels more lively, but this quick patch should suffice for the moment.
