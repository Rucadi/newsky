**Some improvements and rebalancing for [Baba Yaga and the Labyrinth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/84492).***- Changed the innkeeper text from "Hear any interesting rumours lately? (Wild Witch)" to "Heard anything out of the ordinary lately?"
  
- Made it more difficult to craft the potion required to progress the quest. (no longer everything available in the hut)
  
- Removed some loot from the hut and the maze (e.g. placed items and some chests)
  
- Added some additional clutter to the maze where I removed loot
  
- The maze now includes a combat encounter
  
- The witch now buys and sells a wider variety of goods
  
- Rebalanced the effect of the staff which is rewarded for the quest and added a proper description to it
