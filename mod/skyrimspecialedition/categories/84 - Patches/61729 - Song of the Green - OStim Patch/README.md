A simple patch to change the fade-to-black scenes in Song of the Green into OStim scenes.
  
  
Works with the latest Auri 2.0 update and beyond as well as older versions. Make sure this mod is overwriting the original mod! I have tested it myself on the latest version and can confirm it works.
  
  
Not much else to say. I simply replaced three scripts from the original mod with scripts that trigger an OStim scene. Works with OStim NG, OStim Standalone, or the original OStim. Remember to endorse the original Song of the Green mod by Waribiki.
