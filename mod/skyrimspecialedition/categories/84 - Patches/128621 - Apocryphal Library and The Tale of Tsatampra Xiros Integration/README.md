Simple SWAP.ini file to enable integration of [Jenasto](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/1048346)'s [Apocryphal Library](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/121654) with [SlimeSire](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/84859838)'s The Tale of [Tsatampra Xiros](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36707).
  
  
This makes it so that piles of books within the Annals, the Waterlogged Passage, and in the final area where Tsatampra Xiros is located (Desolate Strand) will become containers holding the books added by Apocryphal Library.
  
  
Some book stacks in areas added by The Tale of Tsatampra Xiros are unaffected, such as the shack and village areas. Think of it as Hermaeus Mora controlling the flow of forbidden knowledge outside of areas not closely connected to Apocrypha.
