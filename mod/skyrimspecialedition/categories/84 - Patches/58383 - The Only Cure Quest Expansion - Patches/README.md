The Wintersun patch was tested in-game and works. However, if you're worshiping Peryite when you destroy his shrine you currently WON'T suffer any favor loss. This is more of a consistency issue, rather than compatibility, and one that I'm not sure how to tackle so I'm putting it off until later. 
  
  
Huge thanks to Neilzz and JaySerpa for holding my hand through figuring out how to patch scripts.
