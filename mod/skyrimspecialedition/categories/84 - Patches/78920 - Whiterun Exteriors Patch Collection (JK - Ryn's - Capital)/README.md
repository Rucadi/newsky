Whiterun's exteriors are a *really* popular spot. There's SO MANY mods that touch that area. This patch page will be an ever-growing location where we attempt to cover a number of patches and their combinations for it.
  
  
Major Whiterun Exteriors mods:
  
- [JK's Whiterun Outskirts](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78351) - already patched individually and in combination with Ryn's Whiterun City Limits
  
- [Ryn's Whiterun City Limits](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65661) - already patched individually and in combination with JK's Whiterun Outskirts
  
  
- [Warbird's Whiterun Metropolis](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56839) - patches planned (some are already started), but no ETA﻿
  
- [Whiterun Outskirts Market](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12490) - patches are planned (patch for JK's Whiterun Outskirts it's already on the kojak's page), but no ETA
  
  
- [[color=#ff0000]Dark's Whiterun Market](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22926) [/color]- patches aren't planned in the nearest future
  
- [Whiterun Valley - Hold Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11917) - patches aren't planned at all, but who knows?
  
  
We will not cover every combination. That way lies madness. Like seriously, if you've never dealt with navmesh or landscape conflicts, you genuinely don't know what you're asking for. That likely means it may not cover the specific combo you're looking for. Sorry.
  
  
*Included Patch Descriptions*
  
  
Due to the nature of how these combinations work, there's not going to be a specific list of changes as per usual. Instead, we're going to list what these specific mods did/where they conflicted (ICAIO is a specific exception which will have its changes detailed per request from Shurah).
  
  
As the holidays hit, this project combined with other ones basically hit all of us as a sledgehammer to the face. We've hit version 1.0 now, and Whiterun Market patches will be coming, but they won't be immediate.

[Convenient Carriages](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12693)﻿: I finally beat Tarlazo to one! Ryn's patch is on his page already. CR on landscape for JK. Last checked against version 5.9.7.
  
* [Creation Club: Fishing](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Fishing)﻿ - If memory serves this ended up being needing to rotate one casting marker?
[Creation Club: Tundra Homestead](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Tundra_Homestead): Adds a building and a bunch of stuff around it. Landscape conflicts out the wazoo. Reworked one from Ryn's page.

[Dwemer Colosseum](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4435) - Clean Dwemer Colosseum. It needs it. **JK does not need a patch if cleaned**. Ryn's still does, and the patch is made in such a way that will work if you don't clean it. Last checked against 1.7.1.

HBH didn't include navmesh changes when it honestly *should* have, and I didn't decide to redo it in the patches, so....there's jank in the navmesh here? I should probably fix it? But it's not a priority path so.....yeah. Last checked against version 1.1.
[Iggath](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/75157) - CR on navmesh/landscape/etc. Combo patch for JK + Tundra Homestead + Iggath still needed.  Last checked against version 1.01.0

[Immersive Citizens - AI Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/173)﻿ - ICAIO places multiple markers/has some changes to a couple farms (adding work areas, etc), and correspondingly touches the navmesh in a few cells. There's a few refs there's CR on, adjustment of markers to still be accessible, and re-do of navmesh to restore access to the modified areas. Last checked against version 0.4.0.1
  
* [Immersive Fallen Trees](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8767) - Shifts one fallen tree which was partially clipping into a house. Last checked against version 2.0.2.

* [Landscape and Water Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26138)﻿ - Looooots of CR, but primarily ownership/movement of crops. Ownership should have been added to all added crops, but I probably missed something obvious. Last checked against version 7.9.
[Landscape Fixes for Grass mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9005)﻿﻿ - Conflicts on landscape for obvious reasons. Last checked against version 5.1.

* [Mihail Mammoths](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69391) - Shifts some bones so they're not growing through a placed road. Last checked against version 1.
[Nature of the Wild Lands](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63604) - I can't remember. Disables and adjusts the placement of some trees. Last checked against version 2.4.

* [Skyrim 3D Trees](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12371)﻿: CR on trees, made a couple tweaks to prevent clipping through added fortifications/rocks. Last checked against version 5.0.1.
[Skyrim Better Roads](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2640) - Honestly mostly just removing some fences where it looked silly having a wooden fence in front of a stone fence. Last checked against version 1.4.1.

[USSEP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266) - Patch only needed with JK, Ryn's got updated to be natively compatible. There was a tree growing through a wall mostly, but also some very minor placement tweaks. Last checked against version 4.2.9a.
  
* [Walls of Whiterun](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65144) - CR on navmesh/landscape mostly, if memory serves. I don't think there was any overlap otherwise. Last checked against version 1.3.

**Mods that have been checked and do not need a patch.**

  
* [Point the Way](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/352) - Even though there IS a conflict on a ref with JK, it looks fine either way. Not making a patch
[Skyrim Sewers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9320) - Not actually needed. Turns out Sewers DOESN'T tie into the navmesh, so I'm not going to introduce more problems by forcing it. If followers don't follow you...it's their fault, I swear :P
  
* [Sounds of Skyrim Complete](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8286)﻿ - Crap, while writing this I realized I still need to make a "add SoS stuff to new buildings" patch.

Important thing to keep in mind: **effectively, every mod which mentions "landscape" or "navmesh" probably needs combo patches for everything else which touches that cell and adjacent cells for that record type (and then that cascades to all the ones touching THAT, and so on and so forth). You're not going to be getting all those patches.**
