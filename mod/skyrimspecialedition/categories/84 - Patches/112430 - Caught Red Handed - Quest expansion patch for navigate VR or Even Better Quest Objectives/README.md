I simply carried over changes from Even Better Quest Objectives and tweaked the ones that needed Cardinal directions for those using a paper map and compass in Navigate VR.  You technically dont need Navigate VR or Even Better Qust objectives to benefit from this esp file, it merely changes Jayserpa's quest mod, which you will need to download.  I also carried over my tweaks to the USSEP patch.
