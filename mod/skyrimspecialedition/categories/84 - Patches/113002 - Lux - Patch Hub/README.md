**This is the official Lux patch hub.**Main mod still needs to be installed from the original mod's page. That new page is a patch hub so all patches are now hosted there, thus both can be installed separately. I made that change upon frequent requests since people who need a new patch or different options had to run a quite lenghty FOMOD every single time. It'll also allow me to update more easily.
