Rebalancing and improving Tentapalooza for a more immersive experience. Removed some of the craftable objects to reduce clutter and keep in line with the original Campfire craftables.
  
  
  
- Rebalanced the weight and value of some objects
  
- Witch's Tent is now craftable on the Tanning Rack instead of campfire crafting
  
- Storage Chest and Knapsack are now craftable in the campfire crafting menu instead of Tanning Rack
  
- Memory of Spring spellbook is no longer craftable, instead, it is placed in the archmage quarters
  
- The 2 spells are now expert-level spells
  
- Added additional material requirements to the tent recipes based on their appearance
  
- Placing shrines required gold from 10 to 100
  
- Makeshift Shrines now also require branches
  
- Daedric Shrine crafting recipes reworked
  
- Removed the conditions to craft all of the objects (e.g. Shrine of Boethia requiring Dunmer or Dragonborn DLC quest progress)
  
  
- Removed the following craftable objects:
  
Saturalia Presents
  
Decoration Pumpkins
  
Decorating Tips (needed for the above decoration items)
  
Vampire/Desert tent variants
  
Bedroll variants
  
Tubs, Chairs, and some other misc decorations
