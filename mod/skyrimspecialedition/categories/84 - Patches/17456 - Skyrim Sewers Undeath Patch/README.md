This is a patch for Skyrim Sewers creating compatibility with Undeath.
  
 It moves a sewer exit so it does not conflict with the Undeath sewer exit.
  
Although another patch exists for Skyrim Sewers and Undeath it was outdated prompting me to make this one.
  
  
The original Skyrim Sewers mod is needed.
