Everyone who uses any mod-added weapons with custom types is likely using [SkyUI Weapons Pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37231) by Ashingda by now. As cool as it is, it usually has the side effect of having to either know which perks each weapon type uses by memory or refer to the mod's description, since few of these weapon mods are accompanied by perks, using instead the same perks as one of the vanilla weapon types, which only refer to said vanilla weapon type in their descriptions. This patch neatly integrates my favorite custom weapon mod, [Animated Armoury](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35978) by NickaNak, with my favorite perk mod, EnaiSiaion's [Ordinator](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1137) and its perk descriptions. **ESL-flagged!****This is strictly a UI consistency patch!** Animated Armoury is fully compatible with Ordinator's perks out of the box. This patch only makes the descriptions reflect the fact.﻿﻿
  
  
Here is the list of Ordinator perks affected by this mod and the new weapon types added to their descriptions:

All perks with multiple ranks had their 2nd/3rd ranks edited as well with the relevant additions to their descriptions.
  
  
**HOW TO INSTALL**
  
  
Simply download and install it via your favorite manager (Mod Organizer 2 or Vortex). Manual installation is possible but not recommended, and assistance to manual installs by my part would be limited.
  
  
Whether or not you use LOOT to manage your load order, make sure NewArmoury+OrdinatorPerkDesc.esp is placed lower than Ordinator - Perks of Skyrim.esp.
  
  
**REQUIREMENTS & COMPATIBILITY**Requires [Ordinator](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1137). Technically works without [Animated Armoury](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35978) but the changes to perk descriptions only make sense alongside this mod. [SkyUI Weapons Pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37231) isn't necessary either, but it was what introduced the inconsistency I aim to fix with this patch. Will conflict (and require manual patching) with any mods that make any sort of edit to the perks listed above. Examples of such would be add-ons and tweaks to Ordinator as well as mods that fuse perk overhauls together. The only way to be sure is by checking for conflicts through xEdit.
  
﻿
  
This patch was built upon Ordinator version 9.31.0, with Animated Armoury DAR Version 2.3 in mind. This file will become outdated if:
  
-Ordinator is updated with changes to any of the perks mentioned above (this patch would override the changes). If there's a version newer than 9.31.0 available for Ordinator. a good way to find out if this needs updating is checking the recent Changelogs, as Enai always documents each and every change to perks and perk trees.
  
-Animated Armoury is updated with new weapon types. This would be a minor issue as it would only break the consistency, but Ordinator's functionality would be unaffected.
  
Still, in both cases this patch would require an update to work 100% as intended. Feel free to chime in on Posts and/or PM me in this event so I can make the necessary updates, or feel free to upload your own patch if I'm inactive.
  
  
**USAGE**This patch is incompatible with Oldrim and a 1:1 conversion would be inconsistent since the LE version of Animated Armoury doesn't have whips or katanas. You can use my file as a base for your own Oldrim version of this patch, as my permissions are open.
  
  
Similarly, this patch isn't intended for the non-DAR version of Animated Armoury as it lacks katanas. I strongly recommend switching to the DAR version regardless of whether you plan on using my patch or not as the non-DAR version is no longer supported by NickaNak.
