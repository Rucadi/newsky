**[Smooth Wells](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66715) alternate texture fix:**
  
  
Reorders the mesh blocks in the farm well mesh to match the vanilla order to fix issues with alternate textures being applied to the wrong part of the mesh, resulting in stuff like wood posts made of stone or ropes made of wood. This happens because the alternate texture system replaces the textures on the mesh blocks based on their order (from top down). Examples of mods (non-exhaustive list) that should benefit from this fix:
  
[size=3][size=3][JK's Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6289)﻿[/size] (example in the gallery)
  
[JK's Whiterun Outskirts](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78351)
  
There's also a bonus UV fix for the grates on some of the wells.
  
  
FOMOD has matching options for each of the main file options of FYX - Smooth Wells.

Corrects the position of the bounding spheres on [size=3]winterholdtowerwell02.nif to prevent it from becoming invisible when used in conjunction with certain mods like [JK's College of Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65676). Regular, parallax and Lux compatible meshes available.[/size]
  
  
[size=4]**Requirements:**
  
Only meshes that needed tweaking are included, the original mod is required for the rest!
  
  
**Installation:**
  
Install/uninstall whenever. A mod manager is strongly recommended, overwrite the files from the original mod.
