# My Lux Patches

These are the patches for [Lux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43158) I made for mods in my load order when I couldn't find an official patch. The patches are "quick and dirty" and will not be the same quality of an official patch, but they are still much better than nothing (IMO). So, I'm sharing them in case someone doesn't want to make their own patch.
  
  
Suggested load order is Specific Mod > Mod Patches > The Lux Patch.
  
Example: Forgotten Dungeons > Forgotten Dungeons Patches > Forgotten Dungeons Lux Patch
  
  
All patches are flagged as ESL so they won't take up a slot in your load order.

- [Forgotten Dungeons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/449?tab=description) Special thanks to [Apoapse](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Apoapse?gameId=1704) who let me use the dungeons names from their mod [Apoapse's Renamed Forgotten Dungeons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45077). The dungeon names are integrated into the Lux patch. Give Apoapse a kudos and an endorsement if you can!
