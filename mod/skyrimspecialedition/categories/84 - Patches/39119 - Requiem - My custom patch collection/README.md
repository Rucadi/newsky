This is very much WIP. The more mods I try to add to my playthrough, the more patches I will make for them.
  
  
  
**AI Overhaul SSE** **Patch**
  
  
Forwards Requiem's stat changes to NPCs and AI Overhaul's packages.
  
  
**Dawnguard Arsenal Patch**
  
  
Adjusted Spell Tome  and Weapon value to follow Requiem's, Adjusted leveled items to include Requiem's changes. Forwards Requiem's NPC stats and Dawnguard Arsenal's item distribution. Adjusted tempering recipes.
  
  
**JK's Interiors Patch**
  
  
Patches various JK's interiors by moving the vendor chest that Requiem made visible into unconflicting areas as well as adjusting all the additions to various shops from Requiem to fit in the new altered locations by JK.
  
  
Also includes an optional balance patch to remove or downgrade some of the stuff added by JK's interiors (removing the Daedra Heart in JK's Dragonsreach for example)
