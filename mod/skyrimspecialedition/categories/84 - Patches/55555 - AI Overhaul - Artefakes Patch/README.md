This mod corrects conflicts found on six NPCs (Styrr, Alessandra, Runil, Odfel, Andurs, and Helgrid) which would otherwise either get the new items from Artefakes or the AI changes from AI Overhaul depending on your load order. Now you can have the best of both worlds with this patch. Load after both Artefakes and AI Overhaul.
  
  
For Artefakes version 2.0 and AI Overhaul 1.6.6
