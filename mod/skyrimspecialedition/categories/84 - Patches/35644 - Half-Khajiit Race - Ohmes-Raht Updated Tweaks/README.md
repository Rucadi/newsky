***Consider this a temporary patch until the main mod is updated.
  
Regardless, this should be completely safe to install, uninstall and update at your leisure.***

  

Some tiny but critical bugfixes for NikoJaeger's [Half-Khajiit-Race (Ohmes-Raht)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28702) with optional tweaks.
  
Currently only for the default custom textures version.﻿

  
**NOTABLE FIXES FROM VERSION 6.05**
  
  

  
* Fixed missing chargen/race morphs. RaceMenu morphs and presets should now work correctly (no more weird bloated faces!).
Fixed a corrupted texture that could potentially cause CTDs (*maleheadhalfkhajiit.dds*). New textures are a modest but improved 2k-1k, and based on [Vitruvia Skin Textures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9112)﻿ by Mandragorasprouts and [Svein's Skin](https://voblascreatures.blogspot.com/2021/02/sveins-skin-skyrim-sosvanilla-texture.html)﻿ by Vobla.
  
* Modified texture sets to use default humanoid specular and subsurface maps. For some reason the game wants to use the default head specular instead of the custom one, which causes visible seams when using glossy replacers. This is an imperfect solution that should help minimize seams, but eliminating them entirely requires reworking all textures (stay tuned *\*wink\**).
Modified feet to use your own meshes for better compatibility with body replacers.
  
* Added head complexion options.
**OPTIONAL** - High Poly Head Vampirism fix. The only downside is that your eyes won't automatically change when becoming a vampire, but you can always change them manually in racemenu if you have a mod that makes vampire eyes playable.
  
* Compatibility options for [Aetherius - A Race Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26686) and [Imperious - Races of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1315)﻿.

  
**INSTALLATION**
  
  
Install with your mod manager of choice or extract into your data folder. Overwrite when prompted.
  
  
Please note that the [Imperious](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1315) and [Aetherius](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26686) patches in the base mod are not needed if you select the appropriate plugin version from this page, so either remove them from your load order or make sure they load before this patch.
  
  
Load order should be as follows:
  
  

  
1. *HalfKhajiit.esp*
*HKR - OhmesRahtTweaks.esp*
  
2. (Optional) *HKR - OhmesRahtTweaks - VampFix.esp*

  
Forever a work in progress. If you run into any other bugs, let me know so that I might look into it.
