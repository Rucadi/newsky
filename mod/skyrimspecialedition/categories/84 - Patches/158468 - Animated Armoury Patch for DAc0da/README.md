**Animated Armoury Patch for DAc0da**[left]This mod adds keywords and changes the animation of some of the weapons added by Vicn's **[DAc0da](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/134405)﻿** quest mod, so they can use the animations added by **[Animated Armoury.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15394)**[/left]
  
  

**I have released an [All-In-One plugin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/160379)﻿ for the whole series, get this one instead if you have the whole tetralogy installed. I will keep the individual DAc0da patch updated for those who have DAc0da installed but not the whole series.**

***\*I hesitated to keep the sabers as regular swords. However, given that they are obvious references to Star Wars lightsabers, which are depicted being used with both hands by the samurai-like Jedi (whose fighting styles are also inspired by real-life japanese sword-fencing), I figured making this mod's sabers into katanas would reinforce their connection to Star Wars and bring them closer to how they are portrayed in the movies. Dual-bladed versions are unaffected because the animations wouldn't make sense otherwise.***
