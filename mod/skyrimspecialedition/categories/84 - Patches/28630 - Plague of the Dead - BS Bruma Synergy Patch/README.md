**What does this mod do?**
  
  
This plugin swaps the Zombies introduced in Beyond Skyrim - Bruma to be the ones added by Plague of the Dead. It also replaces the relevant Spell Tome(s) in the Cyrodiil levelled lists.
  
  
**Optional Patches:**
  
  

  
* *Restore Plague of the Dead Sounds* - I have had it reported many times that the Plague of the Dead zombie sounds are more noticeably repetitive, so favoured the Bruma ones, this simply reverts the changes.
*Zombies Wield Weapons* - Bruma's zombies are all normally unarmed, so the zombies in the main patch are adjusted to suit, this patch restores weapon wielding to the zombies.
  

  
*This mod page previously hosted Rare Curios patches, however, with their v2 update, they now have their own page for clarity due to scope of change and having multiple additional patches. [The Rare Curios - Bruma patches can now be found here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60412).*
