\*Partial support

**- Warning -** This mod is a replacer, so will effect every cloak and cape for the mod you select.
  
  
It can *potentially* hit your FPS hard depending on your hardware, mods, configuration,
  
and the number of NPC's in your loaded cells wearing physics-enabled clothing.
  
  
Some people may have no noticeable impact on their performance at all. It depends.
  
HDT-SMP is still an alpha software, and may still have many performance fixes yet to come.

  
  

**--------------------------------------------------------------------**

  
**Requirements & Installation**
  

  
1. Install [SKSE64](http://skse.silverlock.org/)
 Install [HDT-SMP SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30872)﻿ 
  
2. Install the required mod(s) for your desired SMP patch(es)
 Download the main FOMOD or your pick of individual patches with NMM/MO2/Vortex; no support for manual install
  
3. Install with your mod manager; overwrite or override all

  
If you do not already have SMP installed, and you need help doing so, you can watch this video from Tooneyman:  

There will not be further support from me in terms of installing HDT-SMP.
  
Be sure to check out Tooneyman's port of [Resplendent Armor and Greatsword SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17510)!

  
  
  
**Notes**[size=4] **/ Known Issues**
  
- Dragon Priest cloaks from Cloaks of Skyrim do not have physics applied.[/size]
  
- Some clipping issues are certain armors. It could be improved but probably won't ever be perfect.
  
[size=4]
  
**[size=3][size=4]Possible To-Do's
  
[/size][/size]**- Collision/Weighting Improvements (ongoing)
  
[size=3]- Improve [/size]flow movement to be more unique for certain types of Cloak
  
- Full-blown patches to fix problems of the original mods.
  
  
  
Let me know if there is anything truly broken, but no promises on substantial support though.
  
There's definitely improvements that could be made, but take it for what it is for now...

**Permissions**
  
The mod authors of the patched mods have given me permissions to release this or had patch permissions. You do not have permission to redistribute the art assets in these patches in any way due to the permissions being on a mod by mod basis **UNLESS** you check the original mod and contact the original author.
  
  
If they allow esp/esl/esm compatibility patches, then that permission applies here as well.
