[/font][font=Georgia] ﻿? DESCRIPTION
  
  
Some of the trees either added or edited by Fabled Forests intersect with layout introduced by Orc Strongholds. Using Base Object Swapper with zero conflict problems, clippings have been resolved. I mostly repositioned the trees, but occasionally needed to rotate or resize, and delete only one tree because there was no place to put it in the reasonable vicinity. I tried to keep aligned with visions of both authors in the process.
  
  
Based on *Author's Choice* version of Fabled Forests. *Vanilla Proportions* would still benefit from this patch, but *Mythic Proportions* may need additional tweaks.
  
  
  
 ﻿?️ COMPATIBILITY
  
  
Anything! Floating Trees fix (+ BOS version) are compatible by default, for they don't touch the same records.

 ﻿?️ INSTALLATION
  
  
Please use a mod manager of choice.
  
  
If not, extract the file into your data folder.
  
  
I assume you can safely add/remove this mod mid play. This is only a BOS ini.
  
  
But you always back up your saves. This is Skyrim, afterall. You never know when it Just Works™. ??
