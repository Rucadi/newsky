I will look into making a FOMOD after international backlash.
  
[Daedric Armor and Weapon Improvement](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15121)Adds all of the armor and weapons to Open World Loot leveled lists. For Daedric Standalone file.
  
[Redguard Noble Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15526)Adds the armor to leveled lists. Changes npcs to have leveled items, could be useful for later \*hint\*.﻿ Requires Encounter file.
  
[Scoped Bows](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/912)Adds non-unique bows to leveled lists, had to tinker a bit with the falmer bow but I think it's good. Real Bows version no longer requires the other patch.
  
[BillyRo Compendium (NO LONGER SUPPORTED)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49221)Adds every weapon to leveled lists. A few odd ones are sold by khajiit merchants. Don't download the leveled list addon, this replaces that.﻿ If you have the Redguard Noble Armor patch the NPCs it adds will make use of some of the leveled lists added by this mod. ~~To obtain this join the discord in TwoSecond's discord and go to #file-share.~~
  
[Fireglass Armory](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12597)Anywhere glass can be, Fireglass can be also.﻿ Disabled cheat chest and removed distribution script.
  
[Guards Armor Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22671)Functions with the civil war patch. Distributes northerner boots and gauntlets and forwards changes made to Stormcloak gear.﻿

[Legendary Skyrim Crossbows and Bows](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8273)Simple compatability. Let me know if you see anything you shouldn't in-game.﻿
  
Needs [this](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7960) because I couldn't get asset use permission, but it did have a "modify files" permission
  
[Expanded Skyrim Weaponry](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2300)Craft only version.

[Soulsborne Themed Collection](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38149?tab=description)Adds a few weapons to leveled lists, as well as the plauge doctor armor. I tried to stick as close to both games' lore as possible while keeping some semblance of balance.
  
[Mithrodin Sword](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13065)
  
Distributes the swords as ebony.
