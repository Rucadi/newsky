# CC Dawnfang and Duskfang - No Forced Quest

Moves the note and activator that starts the quest "A Soul Divided" to one of the wooden pillars outside of the canal so you aren't forced to start the quest if you want to enter the ratway. Also disables the ghost and trigger box until you interact with the activator so that the quest doesn't start when you enter the room where the ghost normally is. (ESL Flagged)
  
  
Also now included is a patch for [Rebalancing Anniversary Edition - Quest Requirements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61004?tab=description) that way the note only shows up at whatever level you set it to and will still be moved to the different spot.
