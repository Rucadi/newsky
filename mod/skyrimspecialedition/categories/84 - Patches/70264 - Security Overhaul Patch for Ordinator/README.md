This is just a small ini file for Security Overhaul if using it while having the Ordinator perks Hotwire and Lockdown. It works with all vanilla atomatons but the following below require certain mods.
  
  
  
DwarvenConstruction - requires Skyrim Immersive Creatures
  
ESO centurion - Requires Mihail's Dwarven Colossus
  
Dwarven Mageta - Requires Mihail's Dwarven Mageta or Mihail's Dwarven Collection
  
automated dwarven power harness - Requires Mihail's Dwarven Armor, the enemy version.
