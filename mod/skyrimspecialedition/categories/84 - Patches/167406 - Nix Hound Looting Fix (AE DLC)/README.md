**Fixes an issue that the** [Nix Hound pet](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Nix-Hound) **finds loot for the player before the pet is obtained.**
  
  
  
*This mod simply changes the Nix Hound pet looting ability (where the player receives random items after certain intervals) to only work after the pet is bought by the player.
  
I'm unsure why this issue happens in the first place but this mod ensures it doesn't happen without any downside.*Compatible with the [Unofficial Skyrim Creation Club Content Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18975)
