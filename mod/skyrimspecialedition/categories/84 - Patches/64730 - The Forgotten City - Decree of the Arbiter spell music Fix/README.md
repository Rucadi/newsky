I was looking for a solution when I came across a mod by [Maleficus32](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/12650173). I used some of the code from his mod with his permission to get rid of the music after the power has dissipated. This mod is based on [Forgotten City Music Fixer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54019). Which I highly suggest downloading and endorsing.
