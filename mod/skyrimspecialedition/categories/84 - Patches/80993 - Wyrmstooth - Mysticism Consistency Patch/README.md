Wyrmstooth adds some spells that perform the same function as some spells added by Mysticism. This mod removes the Wyrmstooth versions of these spells and replaces them with the Mysticism versions. It also incorporates appropriate keywords and perk support from Mysticism, and adjusts the stats of some Wyrmstooth spells to better match their closest, tier-appropriate Mysticism variant.
  
  
This mod directly builds upon the foundation from [Wyrmstooth - Mysticism Spell Consistency Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63927) by elmiraguth. I expanded upon and updated their work for this mod, so go give them some love.

  
  
Details:
  

  
* Removes instances of some Wyrmstooth spells from the world and replaces them with their matching Mysticism variants
All Ease Burden tomes are replaced with Pack Mule tomes, all Cure Disease tomes are replaced with Mysticism's Cure Disease tomes, all Night Eye tomes are replaced with Mysticism's Night Eye tomes, all Fade Other tomes are replaced with Fade tomes, and all Conjure Skeleton tomes have been replaced with Mysticism's Conjure Skeleton tomes.
  
* Spell tome costs have been normalized to match Mysticism's changes
Summon spells have received adjustments to their spell cost, experience gain, menu descriptions and images, and casting art to match their closest Mysticism counterparts
  
* The Draugr summons and Mudcrab summon have received proper perk support and adjustments to stats to bring them in line with their closest Mysticism counterparts
Ice Volley has received adjustments to better match Mysticism's Icy Spear
  

  
Specific Details on Spell Changes:
  

  
* Draugr Wight: Level 10; 125 Health, 200 Magicka, 100 Stamina; Draugr Warlock class; equipped with an Ancient Nord Sword and Ice Spike
Draugr Scourge: Level 20; 300 Health, 50 Magicka, 200 Stamina; equipped with a Honed Ancient Nord Sword, Iron Shield, and Unrelenting Force

Spectral Mudcrab: Level 5; 50 Health, 220 Stamina; equipped with pinchies
  
* Ice Volley: Frost damage reduced to 40; the unique double stamina damage effect remains. The total damage value of 120 matches Mysticism's Icy Spear.

  
Installation:
  
This mod should be safe to install at any point before beginning Wyrmstooth. I do not recommend uninstalling this at any time during a playthrough, and will be unable to provide any troubleshooting assistance if you decide to do so.
