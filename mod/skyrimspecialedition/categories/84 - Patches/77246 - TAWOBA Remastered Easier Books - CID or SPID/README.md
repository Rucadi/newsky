TAWOBA Remastered by SunJeong (and originally made by Nisetanaka) is a great mod which somehow manages to be both quite immersive and completely immersion breaking at the same time. However, the way it makes you voyage around Skyrim to pick up the crafting books at random locations is a pain - becoming yet more painful on every playthrough.
  
  
This patch for the original mod adds these 14 books to selected traders. If you still want to run around Skyrim to pick them up, you can do that too.
  
Two options:
  
  
1. CID version - RECOMMENDED VERSION. This is the scaled version which releases the books for sale gradually from leather to daedric as you level up from level 1 to 41. Books appear for sale at the Belethor's Goods in Whiterun, Riverwood Trader in Riverwood, Bits and Pieces in Solitude, Arnleif and Sons in Markarth, Niranye in Windhelm, Birna in Winterhold and Pawned Pawn in Riften. 
  
  
OPTIONAL CID version 3.1 - Added crafting books for Draugr Bikini and Dragonscale Bikini by Kofman77 (with their permission). 
  
  
2. SPID version -  Gives all 14 books from the start. The first four books appear at Belethor's, Riverwood Trader, Bits and Pieces and Arnleif and Sons. All more advanced books may only be purchased from Niranye in Windhelm's market or Tonilia in Riften's Ragged Flagon, with Orcish sold also by Ghorza in Markarth.
  
The SPID version can have multiple copies of the same book at vendors - not sure how to fix this.
  
  
Requires the original mod as master (available on SunJeong's website) and SPID if using that version or CID if using that version.
  
  
**CID VERSION**
  
- Uses Container Item Distributor by ThirdEye3301 to distribute the 14 books gradually as you level up from 1 to 41.
  
**-** esl-flagged esp used to manage the levelled list
  
- No patching needed. Load order doesn't matter as long as after TAWOBA.
  
  
**SPID VERSION**
  
- Uses SPID by PowerofThree to distribute the books. 
  
- no esp
  
- no patching needed. Load order doesn't matter as long as after TAWOBA (and Draugr/Dragonscale if using those mods).
  
  
**RECOMMENDED TO GO WITH THIS PATCH**
  
[Add Missing Male Model to Female Armor - xEdit Script (Invisible male Torso Fix) at Skyrim Special Edition Nexus - Mods and Community](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/121748)the great Xedit patcher "Fix World Model.pas" by MaskPlague adds the female world models and the alternate textures to the male file. Why do you care? Because now as a male NPC when crafting or buying you can actually see the TAWOBA (and other modded armour) pieces.
