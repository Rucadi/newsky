# Skyrim Cut Content Restoration - Patch Collection

- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/158229


After much kicking and screaming and badgering from [MissileMann](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/51322576) and [ItzIvy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/73411923), [ChickenMike](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/70500678) finally switched to [Skyrim Cut Content Restoration](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90744) (SCCR for short). This was very irksome for him because it meant he had to patch another large mod into his 3000+ mod load order. Luckily for him, Ivy and Missile also made patches so now this page exists for other people so that they don't have to suffer as much as we did. Please bother us if you have any issues with these patches not the original mod authors. These patches were made by the three of us and not [RoastGorilla439](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/81424703). All plugins are .ESL flagged .ESPs so they won't take up a place in your load order.
  
  

IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU ADD THESE PATCHES TO A NEW GAME. To quote [robertgk2017](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5544506) "Modding is illegal post character start."﻿ You might be able to get away with it if you haven't entered the cell yet but this is neither recommended nor supported.
