**Why this mod exists?**
  
  
This is the third and, as of today, last Wintersun patch for jayserpa's Quest Expansions. Previously, I released Wintersun covers of [The Whispering Door](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/130774) and [The Only Cure](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/131556).
  
  
This is not just a compatibility patch (kudos to [somohexual](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/4645963) for his patches that were released long before my mods).
  
  
This mod adds full [Wintersun](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506) support for jayserpa's [House of Horrors - Quest Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57285), where the choices you make will reflect on the favor of your deity towards you.
  
  
  
**What this mod does?**
  
This mod is a bit special, and it stands apart from my previous patches. And the reason for that is the nature and the character of Molag Mal, the Daedric Prince behind the House of Horrors quest. Molag Bal has enemies. And these enemies have different lore and background. So this patch takes it into account, and the changes of favor reflect the unique characteristics of each deity involved.
  
  
With this mod, you will experience changes of favor depending on your actions, if you follow any of these deities:
  
[Molag Bal](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Molag_Bal)
  
[Boethiah](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Boethiah)[Meridia](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Meridia)
  
[Stendarr](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Stendarr)
  
  
Also, I implemented Wintersun mechanic in one of the ways that player can reason with Tyranus, the Vigilant of Stendarr in Markarth.
  
  
  
**Requirements and recommended mods**
  
Requires House of Horrors - Quest Expansion and Wintersun, naturally.
  
This mod contains scripts, so don't uninstall mid-game.
  
  
Plays well with my [AFDI - Wintersun Tweak](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/131468) mod. With that mod, if you complete the House of Horrors quest as a "good guy", or destroy Molag Bal's artifact in the Aetherium Forge, you will never be able to follow Molag Bal again.
  
  
  
**Patches**
  
There are patches in the Optional files section for the following mods:
  
  
[The Choice is Yours](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3850)
  
Note that if you install my patch for TCIY, this patch - [House of Horrors - The Choice is Yours Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/90617) - is not required.
  
  
[House of Horrors - Quest Expansion - Expanded](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/165821)This is a minimal patch. By that I mean that it was created to cover most obvious conflicts in esp and the scripts. However, it does not offer full Wintersun coverage (considering favor changes and offers to follow a deity) for the entire HOHQEE mod. Track this mod to get notified if/when a full version is released.
