Makes More Critters and Lepidoptera compatible with other critter mods without a patch. (Please feel free to request other patches, because I'd love to add the mods to my list!)
  
Removes the need for a patch between Immersive Interactions and Puzzle Variations (thank you [Kailithnir](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/21107764) for the [previous patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58490))
  
Adds some Requiem and Fozar's Dragonborn records, just in case anything overwrites them.
  
  
Also, thank you [TheShiningAbsol](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/6218685) for Saints and Seducers Bugs Around Skyrim, which was also recently updated to use FLM! It will now work seamlessly and patchlessly with similar mods.
