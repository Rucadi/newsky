A little patch compendium for Skyrim's Unique Treasure Chest Locations not meshing well with certain mods and moving their locations, nothing else has been changed and the purposely buried ones will be kept in-tact.
  
  
So far there's patches for: 
  
  
[Enhanced Lights & FX](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2424) Exterior.esp - Moves the chest in the middle of the 2 Braziers places by ELFX (not a LOS1 or 2 issue) ontop of the Whiterun Watchtower where you fight your first dragon 
  
  
If there's any other mods that cause some chests to be unobtainable or melded into an object via normal means like clipping through or inside of other objects, let me know and i'll try to make a patch for it (If one doesn't already exist)
