A collection of smaller tweaks that tries to enhance the Vigilant mod.
  
  
  
  
**You can choose between an All In One version or download each tweak individually:**
  
  
**Altar of Nocturnal**
  
Removes the Altar of Nocturnal at the start of Act 4 *(this was used to skip parts of the area due to being able to buy keys with septims)*
  
  
**Anvil of Zenithar**
  
Removes the Vigilant crafting station and with it all the recipes, replaced it with a usable vanilla anvil *(the majority of the items can be obtained without crafting, the recipes didn't require blacksmithing skills and are inconsistent with Skyrim crafing)*
  
  
**Bandit Removal**
  
Removes the access to the door in the starting area to the Bandit Kanra *(this NPC is practically a spoiler machine that has no other purpose than revealing secrets etc.)*
  
  
**Harder Stat Purchase**
  
Required Devotion/Radiance to buy stats across the mod from 3 to 30
  
  
**No Debug Room**
  
Removed the keys to the debug room *(this room provides players to choose acts, cheat equipment and honestly shouldn't be accessible through normal play)*
  
  
**No Skip**
  
Removed the Orlando NPC and attached quest entries so the player can no longer skip acts
  
  
**No Shared Chest**
  
Removed all shared chests *(these chest were placed for player convenience all around Act 4)*
