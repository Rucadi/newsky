Dragon Claws Auto-Unlock is a very nice quality of life mod for those of us that have been around the Skyrim block a few times and don't want to constantly have to "solve" the dragon claw puzzle doors. The only puzzle door I ever remember off the top of my head is Bleak Falls Barrow; and the rest? Nope.
  
  
As long as you have the appropriate claw in your inventory, it will unlock the door just by activating the keyhole.
  
  
Ashen, the original author of DCAU, has kindly provided a new script based patcher. I haven't had a chance to test it fully yet so this mod will be in beta for a short time. If you downloaded the individual plugins prior to this - then I recommend switching to this method instead, as it's far more efficient.
  
  
So far the script covers the following mods:
  
  

  
* Legacy of the Dragonborn (confirmed as working)
Wyrmstooth
  
* Konahrik's Accoutrements
Skyrim Sewers
  

  
If you know of any other mods which add new dragon claws and puzzle doors, let me know and I will endeavour to add it to the list.
