**What is "The Halls of Rielle"?***The Halls of Rielle* combines Rielle as found in Beyond Skyrim: Bruma and The Cause (Creation Club) into one great Ayleid city, but retains their individuality via a completely new cave system. This cave system acts as the city's central concourse with doors to each ruin only accessible by completing each dungeon and using their respective exit in order to prevent breaking of any quests.

Rielle's **Temple of Merid-Nunda** (*Beyond Skyrim: Bruma*) has seen much footfall from looters and researchers over the years. Many of the treasures it once held have been removed and its once ornate walls have faded over time.
  
  
The **Great Vaults** of Rielle (*The Cause*) are lavishly decorated and filled with treasures untouched by looters for thousands of years. Due to a lack of accessibility, not much is known about the history of the vaults or what they might have contained.
  
  
**Whitestone Cave** (*The Halls of Rielle*) sits high on the mountainside overlooking the ruins of Rielle with views reaching out from Frostcrag Spire to the Imperial City. The cave has recently undergone seizmic activity, uncovering two previously hidden chambers containing partial remnants of Rielle's **Central Concourse**. The concourse likely once had many exits leading to various parts of the city, however, only two such connections remain accessible, one to the Temple of Merid-Nunda sitting high over the main concourse, and another to the Great Vaults taking pride of place at the concourse's head.
