**Description** ﻿Welcome! This modpage hosts various patches I've made for the [Dagi-Raht](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3166), [Driinkiin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55687?tab=description), and [Ohmes-Raht](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28702) custom races. They're meant largely to resolve conflicts between each other (as well as other mods), but some also act as add-ons. You can find a list of the current patches below:
  
  
**Custom Races**[Dagi-Raht - Lunar Lattice](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3166)
  
  
 ﻿The Dagi-Raht race has addons to give new hair colors (Through USMP) and racial scaling, as well as a patch to resolve confusion when using it alongside the Ohmes-Raht.
  
  
[Driinkiin - Deerborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55687?tab=description)
  
  
 ﻿This custom race is given the same two addons as well as an addition one - the inclusion of a racial description in RaceMenu! It gives brief details about the race's lore and abilities. Also includes patches for Ohmes-Raht and [Project ja-Kha'jay](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57610).
  
  
[Ohmes-Raht - Half-Khajiit](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28702)
  
  
 ﻿Ohmes-Raht is the race I initially built the patch collection on. It is provided the new hair colors and racial scaling as well as patches for Aetherius, HKR Tweaks, and Project ja-Kha'jay. I also have addons for animations and some personal tweaks.
  
  
[Project ja-Kha'jay - Khajiit Diversity](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57610)
  
  
 ﻿Includes the aforementioned patches but also includes patches for [Fluffy Khajiit](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/91729?tab=description) and [HDT-SMP Fluffy Beast Race Tails](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/91811?tab=description&BH=0)﻿ to resolve conflicts between JKJ and these two mods.
  
  
**Patched Mods**
  
  
[Aetherius](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26686)
  
  
 ﻿Aetherius patches are available for Ohmes-Raht only currently (The others technically don't need them). Specifically, I provide patches between Aetherius and[**HKR Tweaks**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35644), as well as addons for new hair colors and racial scaling mods like [Racial Body Morphs Redux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65047)﻿.
  
  
[Catlike Animations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63666)
  
  
 ﻿Addons are provided for Dagi-Raht and Ohmes-Raht. Made for the latest version of [Open Animation Replacer (OAR)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92109)
  
  
[Feline Animations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43048)
  
  
 ﻿Addons are provided for Dagi-Raht and Ohmes-Raht. Made for the latest version of [Open Animation Replacer (OAR)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92109)
  
  
[Fluffy Khajiit](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/91729?tab=description)﻿
  
  
 ﻿A patch is provided between Fluffy Khajiit and Project ja-Kha'jay. There is an additional patch for [HDT-SMP Fluffy Beast Race Tail](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/91811) as well.
  
  
[HKR Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35644) ﻿As mentioned above, I've made patches for HKR Tweaks between Aetherius, USMP (the hair colors), and racial scaling mods.﻿
  
  
[Racial Body Morphs Redux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65047)
  
 ﻿Each race has addons to match racial scaling mods. I built them around the aforementioned mod but they should, in theory, work with others or even without! A racial scaling mod isn't required for these patches but they were made to match.﻿
  
  
**[Unofficial Skyrim Modder's Patch (USMP)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49616)**
  
  
 USMP patches are available for all three races, providing each race with the full USMP suite of hair colors!
  
  
**Installation**
  
  
 ﻿It should be fairly-straightforward. Each patch is included in a FOMOD installer, **but be sure to** **read!** Install the FOMOD through your mod manager and go through the steps, otherwise you can put the plugins in your Data folder.
  
  
**Compatibility**

﻿Due to the nature of these patches and addons, incompatibilities are certainly possible. The most-likely is other custom races, as some may need combo patches as well. It shouldn't be anything too severe. If you want my changes to be forward, however, be sure to load my patches later than others affecting the same races!
  
  
  
**Future Plans**
  
  
As I hoped, I have converted the modpage to a spot for patches for a few custom races, rather than just the one. I'll likely look to resolve other problems in the future, but be sure to leave requests if there's one you want! I started with patches I needed for my upcoming modlist but I can look to expand.
