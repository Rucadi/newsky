This mod requires Hestra's nest and either the SE or the 10nth anniversary edition of the Gray Cowl of nocturnal to be installed. The mod has two versions for the two respective gray cowl of nocturnal versions. The SE version uses a 1.70 plugin and the 10nth anniversary edition a 1.71 plugin. This means that if you are using an old version of skyrim, or skyrim VR, [BEES](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441) is required for the 10nth anniversary edition to work.
  
  
The new pass in the Alki'r desert is located in a corner at the east of the map, between the Shanta Filibb to the south and the Oasis of Mora Sul to the north. Both the border gate in Hestra's nest and the new pass in the Alik'r desert now have map markers.
  
  
The most recent plugins are cleaned with SSEditQuickAutoClean, and there is an optional ESL flagged version of both files. BEES or an updated version of skyrim is required for both ESL plugins.
  
  
I **strongly** recommend using [Talk to the Hand Arenar - Gray Cowl of Nocturnal - Escape from Cold Harbor Required](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/156923)﻿ by Kulharin to avoid the Gray Cowl of Nocturnal quest breaking if you visit the Alik'r desert early.
