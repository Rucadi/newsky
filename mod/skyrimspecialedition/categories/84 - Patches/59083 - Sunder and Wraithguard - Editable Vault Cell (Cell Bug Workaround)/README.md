# Sunder and Wraithguard - Editable Vault Cell (Cell Bug Workaround)

**[b][color=#ea9999]With version 7.0.14 and up, [SSE Engine Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17230)﻿ provides a true fix for this bug, allowing all edits to the original cells. Since mods made that way are fundamentally incompatible with anything made with this worse duplicate cell solution, this mod should be considered obsolete and, following updates to dependent mods, will be hidden. Please DO NOT create any more mods based on this file.**
  
Old mod description while still active:
  
  
[/color]What does this mod do?
  
[/b]
  
This mod is a supplementary master file (ESM) that copies the Sunder and Wraithguard vault and makes it usable to mod authors. All relevant references have been updated and the quest fully playtested to ensure it functions correctly and will provide a stable platform to build off of.
  
  
Without this implementation, a mod editing Sunder and Wraithguard's new cell will cause that cell to break due to the creation being an ESM flagged ESL.
  

**Compatibility**

**﻿**
  
This mod should be compatible with anything that edits Sunder and Wraithguard unless it edits one of the following:
  

  
* The Creation's Quest "Lost Legacy" - *Resolution: Forward the alias changes in the quest from this mod and retain any other changes from the other mod*
The "Sightless Vault" Cell - *Resolution: Apply any changes the mod makes to the original cell to this mod's cell.*
  

  
No edits have been made to Sunder and Wraithguard themselve, so overhauls are 100% compatible.
  
Strings have been retained, so any localisation should be carried forwards (I am not in a position to check this, so let me know if it hasn't and I'll remove this statement).
