# Ryn's Mehrunes Dagon - Patch Collection
- Author: ChickenMike
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/96663
I made a half dozen patches (that have since grown to a lot more) for [Ryn's Mehrunes Dagon's Shrine](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/88451)and now I'm sharing them with you. This is my first Nexus upload so please bear with me. Please bother me if you have an issue with my patches not the original mod authors. These patches were made by me ChickenMike and not Ryn2g. All lighting changes from the original mod have been forwarded and all plugins are .ESL flagged .ESPs so they won't take up a place in your load order. 
  
  

IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU ADD THESE PATCHES TO A NEW GAME.
  
To quote [robertgk2017](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5544506) "Modding is illegal post character start."﻿ You might be able to get away with it if you haven't entered the interior of the shrine yet but this is neither recommended nor supported. 
  
  
These patches require [BEES](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441) to function properly on older game versions.

  

PATCHES

(See screenshots for exact item locations, or don't and be surprised I'm not your dad)

  
[Amulets of Skyrim SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/487) - Moves the amulet to the arm of the throne in the first large room. 
  
  
[Armor and Clothing Extension](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19002) - Moves a robe from the old part of the cell to next to a chest in the back right of the first large room. 
  
  
[Bowgasm SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42929)﻿ - Puts the bow on the shelf on the left side of the second room. 
  
  
[Cloaks of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6369)﻿ - Moves the Daedric Cloak to the first shelf on the left side of the second room. 
  
  
[CROSS\_Crucible\_SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20203)﻿ - Moves the book to a shelf on the left side of the second room. 
  
  
[Daedra Pack- Mihail Monsters and Animals (SE-AE)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/159364) - Makes the two mods load order agnostic and moves the added spell tomes to the bookshelf under the platform to the left of when you enter the first room. 
  
  
[Daedra SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56497) - Scatters the spell tomes and scrolls throughout. I put the Clannfear in the hallway between the two rooms. DO NOT USE WITH MY DAEDROTHS SE PATCH.
  
  
[Daedric Face of God](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92193) - Moves the helmet to on top of a book on a table on top of the platform in the first room. 
  
  
[Daedroths SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44816)﻿﻿ - Scatters the spell tomes and scrolls throughout. Check screenshots for exact locations. I kept the two daedroths that ambush the player when they first enter the dungeon because it is a feature not a bug. DO NOT USE WITH MY DAEDRA SE PATCH.
  
  
[Deadlands Xivilais- Mihail Monsters and Animals](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/91216) - Makes the two mods load order agnostic by forwarding a helmet record. If you load Ryn's mod after Mihail's you don't need this patch. 
  
  
[Dremora Markynaz Armor SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/79753)﻿ - Moves the armor and helmet to the corridor between the rooms. If you're using [Dremora Markynaz Armor - My patches and fixes SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/79766)﻿ by [Xtudo](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/452087) make sure you're using the corresponding patch for your version, either the .ESP or .ESL versions respectively. 
  
  
[Fiendroth Beetles](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70076)﻿ - Scatters some beetles throughout the dungeon.
  
  
[Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802) - Moves the strong box with the Black Band in it to a table on the left side of the last large room and moves the Ancient Daedric Lord Cuirass to sit in the open chest at the very end of the dungeon. This is actually an updated version of [Gonzeh84's Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/91052) that I updated with permission. Now with less floor clipping. 
  
  
[Legacy of the Dragonborn - Hall of Forgotten - Forgotten in History](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64117) - Places the Book of vile darkness﻿ on the second shelf to the left when you first enter the last room. Please note that you should only install this patch if you're using the Forgotten in History add-on from the Hall of Forgotten FOMOD otherwise it will likely break your game. Also if that is the case you didn't need this patch anyhow. 
  
  
[Locked Chests Have Keys](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74565)﻿ - The chest is in the same place that Ryn had it and the key is in the first room somewhere. I'm not going to tell you but its in screenshots. Load this patch after my Pilgrim and Daedric Shrines patch. 
  
  
[Lore Friendly Guns of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60183)﻿ - Specifically for the handgun plugin. Moves the gun and the bullet to the shelf next to the enchanting table to the left of the first large room. 
  
  
[Lost Relics of Tamriel - Echos of the Past](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/122137) - Moves the sword from floating off randomly to leaning against the chest at the end of the dungeon
  
  
[Lux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43158) - TWO VERSIONS ONLY USE ONE. These plugins will revert GG's lighting back to Ryn's. GG gave the shrine the same lighting as a Nordic ruin. While it looks excellent I personally prefer Ryn's more stylized redish lighting so I made a plugin to revert it back. There is a version for if you do have the Lux - Ryn's Mehrunes Dagon Shrine patch.esp installed from the [Lux - Patch Hub](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/113002) and one if you do not. 
  
  
[Mehrunes Dagon Unique Shrine - Shrine Objects Swapped - Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/133264) - Swaps the objects that need to be swapped via a BOS SWAP INI. The door inside the shrine can't be swapped because there isn't an animated asset. This INI was provided by [LoadBearingNoodle](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3108882). Go check their stuff out! 
  
  
[Mehrunes Razor Perk Tree](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/111253) - Moves the book added by MRPT to a bookshelf on the left side of the first room. 
  
  
[MorrowLoot Ultimate](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3058) - Moves the boots that MLU adds to next to the chair on the upper platform in the first room
  
  
[Mythic Dawn armor SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/84280)﻿ - Scatters the armor parts throughout the dungeon. I honestly forgot where I put them all but I did screenshot them all so check there. Be sure to use the correct patch for you're version of the mod as there is a patch for both the .esp and .esl versions of the armor. My ESP patch works with both [Xtudo](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/452087)'s [Patches and fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/84325)﻿ and [tatururutia](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/20621889)'s [HDT-SMP Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/84655). 
  
  
[Oblivion Artifact Patch SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10644) - Moves the ring to the table on the left side of the second large room. DO NOT USE THIS PATCH IF YOU'RE USING THE LEGACY OF THE DRAGON BORN OBLIVION ARTIFACTS PATCH AS IT DISABLES THE RING.
  
  
[Pilgrim and Daedric Shrines Consistency and Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63617)- Moves the activator to the pauldron at the end of the dungeon and disabled leftover floating objects. I built the patch against the map marker version without Sithis but it has been confirmed to work with all versions. 
  
  
[Tamrielic Culture](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11418) - Moves the floating wine to the table on the left of the first room and moves the ingot to the pile at the back of the dudgeon.
  
 
  
[The Cause - Reduced Cut](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66676) - Replaces Ryn's Oblivion Gate with the one from The Cause at the very end of the dungeon and adds the alter activator thingy to the right of the gate. ABSOLUTELY REQUIRES A NEW GAME. 
  
  
[Zim's Dremora Improvements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12128) - This mod adds several objects. I moved the scrolls to the first shelf on the left of the last large room. The robes to the small shelf in the hallway between the two big rooms and spread the spell tomes out throughout the entire dungeon.﻿ If I forgot to mention something here check the screen shots. 
  
  
  

FAQ

  
Q:What took longer making the patches or putting the mod page together?
  
A:The patches but boy does it feel like the other way around. 
  
  
Q:Do these patches work with my game version?
  
A:as long as you use [BEES](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441) you should be fine.
  
  
Q:Wow these patches sure look complicated to do how did you make them?
  
A:Truthfully it's not that complicated. It took me like an hour to learn the CK and to be honest you should already know how to use SSEedit. Janquel's [guide](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37651)﻿ is an invaluable resource and without it I wouldn't have known where to even start. If I can do it you can too!
  
  
Q:Why are your screenshots so bad?
  
A:I literally haven't intentionally taken a screenshot in Skyrim in my over 1600 hours until the week before I uploaded this. I'll get better hopefully. 
  
  
Q:FOMOD?
  
A:I did one! I didn't want to but I did. 
  
  
Q:Do you take patch requests?
  
A:My primary reason for making patches is personal use but if I can make the patch quickly I'll consider it. 
  
  
Q:You haven't had any recent activity on Nexus and I need to get a hold of you, how can I do that?
  
A:@ChickenMike in either Ryn or Janquel's discords and I should see it. I'm also in a bunch of other discords, but I check those two the most regularly.
  
  
Q:Why are you missing so many screenshots?
  
A:I'm lazy and taking screenshots is super tedious and I hate it.
