[Ryn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/81880043)﻿'s location overhauls are a great addition to Skyrim. Covering many different areas, and also being an ongoing project, there is an ever-increasing number of conflicts with other mods. Since Ryn has decided to not create any 3rd-party patches himself, that is being left to other modders, resulting in some of his mods severely lacking patches to other mods, as well as DLCs. This collection mostly consists of patches for the mods I am using, which previously didn't have a patch. [Czasior](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/9933289) and [ra2phoenix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/111052) have also contributed with a few patches. As of version 2, this should be the most complete patch collection for Ryn's Skyrim to date, and will hopefully be expanded into a more complete collection in future (when my collaborators have time; I have done most of my part).

**Patches provided elsewhere**

  
* My patches for [Landscape Fixes For Grass Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9005) can be found here (should now fully complement the patches found elsewhere): [Various Landscape Fixes For Grass Mods Patches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/128121)
Patches for Seasonal Landscapes - Unfrozen are available here for all of Ryn's mods that need it: [Seasonal Landscapes - Unfrozen - More Patches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/91359)
  
* A patch between Ryn's Farms and Open Cities is available here: [Jonado's Open Cities patches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/84729)

  
**Load order and compatibility**

  
* The ELFX patches **must load last** of all mods that affect the same cells, otherwise you will not get the intended light settings. Moreover, Ryn's Lund's Hut does not need any patch as long as EnhancedLightsAndFX.esp loads **after** Ryn's Lunds Hut.esp.
JK's Riften Outskirts[color=#ffffff] is generally **not** compatible with the [/color]Ryn's Farms[color=#ffffff] patches provided at this page, and this is true even if you have a compatibility patch between those mods. I have not checked against every single patch, but if the patch is making changes to the Riften area, you should treat it as incompatible.[/color]
  
* The patch between Ryn's Farms, Riften Extension, and Ryn's Standing Stones is not needed if using the Landscape Fixes For Grass Mods patch for the same mods. Also **don't**[color=#ffffff] use the patch found at [Ryn's Skyrim Official Patch Hub](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73778). It is outdated.[/color]
[color=#ffffff]The Ryn's Farms - Riften Extension Northshore - Riften Docks Overhaul patch should [/color]**not**[color=#ffffff] be used together with the Ryn's Farms patch at the Riften Docks Overhaul page.[/color]
  
* [color=#ffffff]The Ryn's Farms - Riften Extension Southwoods patch is not compatible with CACO Farm Overhaul (neither is the Northshore patch). There is a patch for that combination at the original mod page, but it is not compatible with the most recent version of Riften Extension. My original intent was to carry over the CACO Farms part of that patch into a new patch, but I found it too much work for a mod I don't use myself. Perhaps it will be added to this page in future, but don't count on me to do it. The same goes for the Rift's Rest patch, except that that mod doesn't interest me the slightest.[/color]
Ryn's Alchemists Shack - LAWF patch.esp and Ryn's Bleakwind Basin - LAWF patch.esp are not needed together with the Landscape Fixes For Grass Mods patches for the same mods. Ryn's Karthspire - LFfGM patch.esp [color=#ffffff]must load [/color]**after** Ryn's Karthspire - LAWF patch.esp[color=#ffffff].[/color]
  
* Ryn's Farms - RiftenExtNorth patch.esp[color=#ffffff] and Ryn's Farms Grass Fix.esp must load **after** Ryns\_Farms\_-\_LAWF\_patch.esp.[/color]
Ryn's Anise's Cabin.esp must load **after** Ryn's Standing Stones.esp. No patch is needed if respecting this.
  
* RynsWhiterunCityLimits.esp must load **after** Ryn's Bleakwind Basin \_USSEP\_Patch.esp (neither are included in this collection, but useful to know).
If you are using [Capital Windhelm Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42990), then WindhelmSSE.esp[color=#ffffff] must load **after** Ryn's Farms.esp[/color]. The two mods don't need any patch if following this load order.
  
* If you are using [JK's Sky Haven Temple](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63039), then Ryn's Karthspire.esp[color=#ffffff] must load **after**JK's Sky Haven Temple.esp[/color]. No patch is needed if respecting this.[color=#ffffff] [/color]
[Consistent and Open Capital WIndhelm](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68753) would normally need a patch with Ryn's Farms, but the conflicts are resolved by using the patch for Unique Windhelm Farms and respecting the following load order: Ryn's Farms.esp - WindhelmSSE.esp - Capital Windhelm worldspace consistency.esp - Unique Windhelm Farms.esp - Open Capital Windhelm.esp - Open Capital Windhelm and WIndhelm Farms Navmesh Patch.esp - Ryn's Farms - Unique Windhelm Farms patch.esp[color=#ffffff].[/color]
  
* If you are using [Obsidian Weathers and Seasons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12125), then Obsidian Weathers.esp should load **after** Ryn's Azura's Shrine.esp, Ryn's Dragon Mounds AIO.esp, and Ryn's Broken Tower Redoubt.esp[color=#ffffff].[/color]
Ryn's Saarthal.esp[color=#ffffff] needs to load **after** Draugr Upgrades and Improvements.esp if you want to play with Ryn's intensions for the boss.[/color]
  
* [color=#ffffff]The patch provided here between Ryn's Farms and Landscape and Water Fixes should not be used together with the one provided at [Ryn's Farms AIO - Landscape and Water Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72747). The patch provided at this page is currently much more complete, and there is anyway nothing included at the other patch that is not included here.[/color]
