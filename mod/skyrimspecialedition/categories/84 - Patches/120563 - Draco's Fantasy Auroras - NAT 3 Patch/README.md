# Draco's Fantasy Auroras - NAT 3 Patch

What this is:
  
  
A quick patch for NAT III and Draco's Fantasy Auroras prioritizing NAT III's custom values while keeping Draco's Fantasy Aurora's custom auroras.
  
  
What this isn't:
  
  
A standalone mod - this requires [NAT 3](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27141) and [DFA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32871) to work.
  
A perfect patch - this is only a forwarding of values into a small, esl-flagged esp. This probably won't work if you have placed other mods that modify the same weather records below this esp in your load order.
