Adds mod-added blacksmiths/enchanters to the NPC crafting system from [Honed Metal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61015) with [FormList Manipulator](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74037).
  
  
**Supports the following mod added NPCs:**
  
- The Great Village mod series
  
- The Great City of Winterhold
  
- JKs Skyrim
  
- Cutting Room Floor
  
- ClefJ's Morthal
  
- JK's Solitude Outskirts
  
- Beyond Skyrim: Bruma (optional file that adds unvoiced support)
  
  
  
Currently, only the Bruma Addon adds an enchanter, the other mods listed don't have an NPC that qualifies as an enchanter.
  
  
If you encounter blacksmiths/enchanters that aren't integrated into Honed Metal with this patch let me know. (Click the NPC in the console and send me a screenshot)
