# The Only Cure - Quest Expansion - Wintersun patch

**Why this mod exists?**
  
There are several mods that add [Wintersun](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506) compatibility to [The Only Cure - Quest Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57683) (TOCQE). Originally, this mod was going to be an update of [somohexual](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/4645963)'s Wintersun patch. Then, I decided to dig a little deeper, and eventually added full Wintersun support to TOCQE.
  
  
  
**What this mod does?**
  
Like other TOCQE - Wintersun patches, it gives you a prompt to follow Peryite at a certain stage of the quest.
  
  
Unique feature of this mod is that if you are a follower of Peryite (or become one during the quest), it closely follows the choices you make along the quest, resulting in favor increase or decrease.
  
  
I made Peryite very sensitive, so do show some respect!

**Installation**
  
  
- Load after TOCQE and Wintersun.
  
- Made with the latest versions of TOCQE (1.05) and Wintersun (3.2.0).
  
- This mod contains scripts, so don't uninstall mid-game.
  
- I highly recommend to install my [AFDI - Aetherium Forge Destroys Items - Wintersun Tweak](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/131468). It has in-built TOCQE support and will do so that if you offend Peryite greatly - you will never be able to follow him again! 
  
- If you use [iNeed - Food Water and Sleep - Continued](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19390) - make sure to install my [iNeed - Wintersun Peryite patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/131555)!
  
- If you use [Daedric Shrines - All in One](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78772) - make sure to install The Only Cure patch from [this modpage](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78809) by Xtudo and then install TOCQE - Wintersun - Daedric Shrines Xtudo patch from the Optional Files section of this mod!
