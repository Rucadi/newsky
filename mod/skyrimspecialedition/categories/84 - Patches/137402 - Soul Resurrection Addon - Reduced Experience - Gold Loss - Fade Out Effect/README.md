**Mod Overview**
  
These are some tweaks I made to [Soul Resurrection - Injury and Alternative Death System](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/128265) for personal use. I am releasing it for those who may want it.
  
  
Currently, this mod features four new effects that happen on "death". Everything within the mod is optional and customizable in the FOMOD.
  
  
1. **A fade to black effect on "death" and a fade-in on revival.** The idea being to sort of imitate a loading screen/add the sense that some time has passed.
  
You can see how it looks below (Note: its significantly more smooth in-game, the video frame rate is just capped to 30s).:
  
  
  
2. **A skill XP debuff on "death"**to disincentive cheesing the same enemy for skill level ups.
  
By default, this debuff slows leveling by 50% but you can customize it to a higher value in the FOMOD installer. Additionally, the FOMOD allows you to decide when the debuff becomes active: either during the Soul Exhaustion debuff (lasting 1 minute) or the Injury debuff (lasting several in-game hours).
  
  
Personally, I use EXP reduced by 95% while Soul Exhaustion is active. So, essentially, if I die, I just won't gain any skill level ups for that fight which feels fair to me.
  
  
3. **Exp loss on "death" for users of** [Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751). DO NOT use this plugin unless you use [Experience](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17751) or a similar mod.
  
By default, upon "death", you lose xp equal to 10% of the total experience required to progress to the next level.
  
  
With xEdit, You can change the percentage of EXP lost by changing the value of the record **madPercentExpLoss**in "Soul Resurrection - EXP Loss on Death.esp" to whatever you want.
  
  
 Also, as a precaution, you won't lose XP if you have already hit the "Level Up" point (but have not actually level upped via the menu). And if your XP would ever go negative, it is instead set to 0.
  
  
Make sure "Soul Resurrection - EXP Loss on Death.esp" loads lower than "Soul Resurrection - Fade on Death.esp" if using both.
  
  
4.**Gold loss on "death".**
  
By default, upon "death", you lose 10% of your total gold.
  
  
With xEdit, You can change the percentage of gold lost by changing the value of the record **madPercentGoldLoss**in "Soul Resurrection - Gold Loss on Death.esp" to whatever you want. Range is (0.01 to 1).
  
  
Make sure "Soul Resurrection - Gold Loss on Death.esp" loads lower than "Soul Resurrection - Fade on Death.esp" if using both.
