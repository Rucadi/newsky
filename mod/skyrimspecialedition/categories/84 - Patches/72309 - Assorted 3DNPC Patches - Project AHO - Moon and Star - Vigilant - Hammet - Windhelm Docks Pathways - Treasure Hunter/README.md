I'm splitting off any of the patches from my [patch page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57365) which have downloads in the thousands because a) they seem popular enough to warrant it (read: thanks, random Wabbajack list!), and b) searching for them is a royal PITA because my patch page was meant to be a dumping ground moreso than a collection. (But  seriously, click the link, you might find some others that are useful)
  
  
[3DNPC](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194) - [Vigilant](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11849) - CR on one cell settings, forward Update.esm navmesh change over Vigilant (but then re-tie the door into it) so some 3DNPC stuff is still accessible, but mostly moves some objects, updates a quest and note to reflect these changes, and the objects were placed inside a destroyed building which Vigilant covers up with a functional building.  3DNPC version: 4.4, Vigilant version: 1.6.2
  
  
[3DNPC](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194) - [MAS](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4301) - Cleaning up navmesh from a direct conflict, a few CR on cell settings. I also cleaned up a landscape seam and a bit of object clipping that seems unrelated to 3DNPC itself, as opposed to Dawnguard.esm, so maaaaaaybe revisit this later as a potential unofficial patch to go through everything, but didn't feel like tackling that right this second. 3DNPC version: 4.4, Moon and Star version 3.2
  
  
[3DNPC](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194) - [Treasure Hunter](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5789) (will work wikth any of the fixed ESPs either) - Shifts the corpse at the Dawnstar Lighthouse around the corner so the 3DNPC dude isn't working on his book next to a corpse. 3DNPC version: 4.4, Treasure Hunter version 1.1 (or the fixed ones)
  
  
[Hammet's Dungeon Pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12186) - [3DNPC](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194) - Resolves a navmesh conflict between added dungeons that share a cell. 3DNPC version: 4.4, Hammet version 2.03 and 2.04 (different plugins)
  
  
[Project AHO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15996) - [3DNPC](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194) - Combines navmesh changes between the two where there's a conflict, one CR on cell settings. 3DNPC version: 4.4, Project AHO version 2
  
  
[Windhelm Docks Pathways](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8697) - [3DNPC](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194) - Navmesh conflict resolution. 3DNPC has a quest which adds a ship, which needs to be navmeshed, and it and Windhelm Docks conflict in their navmesh *pretty badly* which would result in NPCs being unable to navigate outdoors during that quest because WDP isn't an ESM and would override it. 3DNPC version: 4.4, Windhelm Docks Pathways version 1.32
  
  
*Installation*
  
Use a mod manager/organizer to install, or drop the loose files into your Skyrim data folder. Patches should have their appropriate masters set, and should be  loaded after any mods which they are patching. Some of the fixes in question are on persistent objects, and may require a new save.
  
  
*Compatibility*
  
These are navmesh patches. I don't know what else you've got installed. There's absolutely potential for conflict but that's the nature of navmesh. Use your brain?
