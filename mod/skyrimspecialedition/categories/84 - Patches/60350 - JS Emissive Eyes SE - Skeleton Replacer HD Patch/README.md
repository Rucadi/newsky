# JS Emissive Eyes SE - Skeleton Replacer HD Patch
- Author: Mura - johnskyrim - PraedythXVI
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60350


The skeleton replacers by PraedythXVI cause the newly added eye emissive meshes from JS' mod to be misaligned, since the latter mod matches vanilla while the former reshapes it. My mod repositions those meshes to match the former more properly, without affected Draugrs.

FEATURES
  
  

  
* Separates the skeleton emissive eye meshes﻿ to their one file path, so that my repositioning won't cause issues on Draugrs.
Redirects the "Off" option for Skeletons to an empty mesh, so you can make a transition from empty eye sockets to glowing eyes when they enter combat if you tweak the MCM for that purpose.
