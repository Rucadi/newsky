A simple compatibility patch with Beyond Skyrim Bruma and Bathing in Skyrim renewed, ESL.
  
Should fix missing references with and reduce Papyrus and Save bloat that could cause ctd or false save corruption bug.
  
  
The additional patch is for Bathing in Skyrim renewed and Simple Hunting from Jayserpa, modifies levelled loot and crafting recipe for regular Soap removing Troll Fat and replacing it with animal fat.
  
  
  

  
* Floral Soap and Basic Soaps: Replaced Troll Fat with Animal fat (easier to get around) - Craft at the cooking Pot
Spriggand and Dwemer Soap: Recipe Unchanged
  
* Craftable Linen Wraps: With 4X Tundra Cotton - Craftable at the Tanning Rack

  

**Update**

  
Added Optional File: False Save Corruption fix for Beyond Skyrim Bruman in AE 1.6.1170.0.
  
[left]﻿Quick workaround if you have heavily scripted mod list with Beyond Skyrim SE Bruma and you get False Save Corruption bug even With Engine Fixes Toml for AE and you see this error in Papyrus logs:
  
  

```
﻿[code]﻿Cannot call HasKeyword() on a None object, aborting function call
```

  
[/code]
  
It may choke it and you get false save corruption bug.
  
Edited the maintenance quest script so it does not fire the auto undress when in bathouse event. Obviously the side effect it will not undress in Bruma, but all Bruma's Maintenance quests still run fine.
  
  
(Beyond Skyrim SE Bruma required as Master, for obvious reasons)[/left]
