[Unique Flowers and Plants](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29154) goes around Skyrim and hand places lots of new plants as actual objects, but I was noticing issues with some Seasonal changes even when having Flowers and Plants up near the top of my LO. Turns out some of the landscape painting done in the mod messed with some of the stuff Seasonal Landscapes and others in my LO were expecting to work with, even if its vanilla terrain in most spots. 
  
  
Taking Inspiration from a similar mod done for [Northern Roads](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/79168) - I spent a while in xEdit and just removed all the Landscape edits so its just new objects placed in the world. Since Unique Flowers and Plants hand places the plants, the landscape edits arent needed to see these plants in game. I haven't checked everywhere so there might be some oddities like a slight floating plant somewhere or similar, akin to the same issues you would find in [Let me guess someone stole your sweetROADS](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/79168) but these are fixable a lot easier than repainting everything.
  
  
The mod even notes put it at the top of the LO so other Landscape edits overwrite but with this you can just put it anywhere or merge it into any other worldspace adding content mod. This is for the ESL version of the mod and I dont think I wanna sit through another really long xEdit session for each of the ESM, ESP, or ESL files. If you really really desire the ESM or ESP for whatever reason over the ESL'd ESP just change the flag of this mod in xEdit.
  
  
If you have any patches for Unique Flowers and Plants I would recommend opening them in xEdit and removing any Landscape edits and just leave alone any moving/removing of plants
  
  
UPDATE: Added optional file that's kind of not related but maybe BlameDragon will want to host it on his Seasonal Unique Flowers Page. That mod is made for the main file of Unique Flowers and Plants, the non-esl thus the formID's in the seasons ini don't match.
  
This optional file is just two ini's that require the original Seasonal Unique Flowers downloaded, replace the inis with these if you use the ESL version of the mod and want the seasons changes.
  
  
Install:
  
1. Have [Unique Flowers and Plants](https://www.nexusmods.com/Core/Libs/Common/Widgets/DownloadPopUp?id=145685&nmm=1&game_id=1704) Installed already (REQUIRED)
  
2. Install this mod after it in the Left Pane of MO so the ESP overwrites.
