> **PATCH HUB FOR [VAMPIRE EYE FIX](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/75528?tab=description)
>   
> ﻿By default, Skyrim will change your eyes to the standard vampire eye that is used by all vampire races. It will also force you to use the vampire face part even if you switch it to high poly. This mod will disable the features that are automatically applied when you become a vampire and allow you to retain your appearance or customize your current preset.﻿ Custom races and mods that affect the vampire race will interfere or revert these changes. Patches are required for custom races or vampire overhaul mods. Request patches in comments.**
