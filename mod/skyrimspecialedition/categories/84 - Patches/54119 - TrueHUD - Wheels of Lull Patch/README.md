An .ini that allows [TrueHUD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62775) to recognize most bosses from [Wheels of Lull](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/748) so they show up with a big health bar.
  
  
It should work with most bosses and mini-bosses in the mod.
  
  
2024-02-07 Version 1.1: Updated folder structure to work with TrueHUD instead of True Directional Movement. If you've already renamed the
  
folder to make this work with TrueHUD, there's no need to update this mod.
