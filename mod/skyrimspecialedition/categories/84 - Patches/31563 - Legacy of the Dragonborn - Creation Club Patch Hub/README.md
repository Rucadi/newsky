[color=#ffffff]Here you will find various support patches for Legacy of the Dragonborn and Creation Club content.
  
  
As of v2.0, the Creation Club patches centralize around a new hall added to the museum. Here they are given their own set of displays that will not conflict with other patches for the museum and will provide a more robust base for patches moving forwards. Where a Creation and Legacy (or in the future, Odyssey) share an artifact, Legacy's artifact will either be replaced, or, in certain special cases, the Creation's quest line might be tweaked slightly to make everything play nicely together.
  
  
Where a patch is listed as "(CC Disabled)" it is required that you have no patches or other mods related to that Creation installed, doing so will cause issues in your game and also voids any potential support.
  
  
[/color]*For these reasons, it's not recommended to run the Unofficial Creation Club patches with this collection.*
