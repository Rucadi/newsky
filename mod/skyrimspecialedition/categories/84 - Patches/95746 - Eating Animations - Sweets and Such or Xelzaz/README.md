✦ There are 2 Patches, one for Sweets and Such and one for Xelzaz The Fully Voiced Argonian Telvanni Follower
  
  
✦ You can have both patches installed, they are independent of each other
  
  
✦ The plugins are ESL flagged
  
  
✦ They are safe to install mid-game and should be safe to uninstall mid-game
  
  
✦ The patch for Sweets and Such includes these 2 new edibles that have the nif files, but I can't find them in the Sweets and Such ESP plugin

Note: The animation for Ice Cream Goblet isn't quite fit but sadly I'm not familiar with animations to change it :(
