**Amorous Adventures for OStim Standalone - Patch and Fixes**
  
Read the description carefully before using this mod. I have below, in detail, the installation instructions and **everything that this mod implements and fixes**. This mod patches the original [Amorous Adventures for OStim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48912) to work with [OStim Standalone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98163) - along with other fixes so that the missing romance scenes play properly. No additional ESP!
  
  
**This patch also works out of the box if you use Open Animations together with other animation packs for OStim Standalone.**

**1. Requirements list, my mod will not work without them**
  
- [OStim Standalone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98163)
  
- [Amorous Adventures for OStim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48912)
  
- [Night-blooming Violets for OStim Standalone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98276) - high quality animation pack for lesbian scenes.
  
  
- [Open Animations Romance and Erotica](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98732/) - not required but HIGHLY recommended as it has some of the highest quality OStim animations.
  
  
- [Amorous Adventures OStim Standalone - OStim Sequences](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106773) - not required, but if you want Amorous Adventures for OStim Standalone to play pre-determined animations instead of you controlling them, along with other edits, then use that mod and let it overwrite this one. READ ITS DESCRIPTION CAREFULLY!
  
  
  
  
**﻿2. Installation instructions**
  
Use the mod manager of your choice to install this mod. I will not provide support for manual installations.
  
  
**1) Install [b]OStim** Standalone and all its requirements by **carefully** following the [OStim Standalone Installation Tutorial](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/5654)﻿. Failure to do this will make things not work properly in the first place. Do not skim through the installation tutorial, read all of it carefully![/b]
  
  
If you're having trouble getting OStim to work, join the [OStim Discord](https://discord.com/invite/RECvhVaRcU) and post your questions on the support channel. I will not provide OStim related support on my mod page.
  
  
  
**2) Install [b][Amorous Adventures for OStim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48912)**. My patch will not work without the original mod! I merely updated the necessary scripts for the Amorous Adventures port to OStim to work with OStim Standalone and Open Animations. All of the other assets are present in the original mod and you obviously need them for Amorous Adventures to work.[/b]
  
  
**IGNORE THE OSTIM HELP CENTER LINKS IN THAT MOD, AS WELL AS ANYTHING RELATED TO OSEX. FOLLOW ONLY THE OSTIM STANDALONE INSTALLATION GUIDE LINKED IN STEP 1) OF THIS PAGE.**
  
  
**3) Install this mod and let it overwrite Amorous Adventures for OStim (or in other words, let my patch win all conflicts).**
  
  
Please note that this patch contains the Amorous Adventures esp file which will replace the one you already have from the original Amorous Adventures for OStim mod, so it won't take an additional slot on your load order.. It also contains a set of updated scripts from the original Amorous Adventures for OStim mod. No new scripts were added, and no scripts were removed. I also did not touch any vanilla scripts.
  
  
  
**The current version of my patch is 3.0.0 and it only works with Amorous Adventures for OStim 3.4.0.3 Beta, the latest version! Do not try to use it with earlier versions of the Amorous Adventures for OStim mod - some scenes will fail to trigger if you do not use the latest version of both mods!**
  
  
  
  
**3. Motivation**
  
[JameStarker](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/50438361) did a very good job of porting the Amorous Adventures mod to the OStim framework. Be sure to endorse his mod!
  
  
However, his mod relies on OSex animations, which are not compatible with the more modern OStim Standalone and Open Animations - not only they are much higher in quality, they are also still being actively supported, with new animations being added every week. Therefore, many users were requesting the Amorous Adventures for OStim mod to be updated to support OStim Standalone and Open Animations. Since no one else had already done it, I decided to give it a shot myself and this was the result.
  
  
  
  
**4. What this patch fixes and improves**
  
  
A problem with the original version using OSex was that some scenes were missing in the Amorous Adventures quests, particularly those that involved a kiss, an NPC masturbating, two NPCs having a romance scene while the player watched and the threesome animations which involved the player and another 2 NPCs.
  
  
With this OStim Standalone patch, all of those scenes will now play properly! For instance, the threesome scenes with Adelaisa + Jenassa and Serana + Senna should now be properly shown. You can also ask 2 lovers of your choice for a threesome at any time through the original Amorous Adventures mod dialogues. Basically, every possibility that existed in the original Amorous Adventure mod has been unlocked with this patch.
  
  
There was also a missing romance scene between Lydia and Adrianne at the end of the quest An Angel in Steel. This patch also restores that scene in the form of a threesome with the player.
  
  
  
  
**5. Frequent Questions and Problems**
  
  
**1) Is this safe to install midgame?**
  
  
Yes, **my mod is safe to install midgame if you already have OStim and Amorous Adventures installed.** Technically, installing OStim and Amorous Adventures midgame shouldn't cause much trouble either, but I won't be responsible if you do that and something breaks. It's up to you.
  
  
  
**2) Is it safe to update this mod midgame? How to update?**
  
  
Yes, this mod is 100% safe to update midgame unless otherwise specified.
  
  
To update, simply uninstall the old version from your mod manager, download the new version, and install the new version. Nothing else is needed!
  
  
  
**3) Your patch changes scripts, is it safe?**
  
  
Yes, my mod only updates already existing scripts in the original Amorous Adventures for OStim mod. **It does NOT****add nor remove any scripts**. It also does NOT touch any vanilla scripts either.
  
  
To add to all that, all the scripts edited only fire when starting an OStim scene or when a quest related to Amorous Adventures advances stage. So this makes installing it midgame ultra safe. Seriously, nothing about it can break.
  
  
The only thing that you will miss are the sexy scenes from quests you have already completed if you install this patch midgame. But hey, better late than never!
  
  
  
**4) Is it safe to uninstall your mod midgame after I have installed it?**
  
  
Due to the nature of the mod described above, yes, it should also be safe to uninstall my patch midgame. All that it will happen is that you're going to lose the functionalities implemented by this patch
  
  
  
**5) I use other animation packs along with Open Animations, with their respective compatibility patches. Can I still use your patch?**
  
  
Yes, you can still use this patch even if you use other animation packs along with Open Animations. The scenes will start with Open Animations animations, but from there, you can navigate to other animations from your other packs!
  
  
  
**6) I'm having trouble with some scenes or animations not triggering. What's wrong?**
  
  
After several tests, I can say with confidence this isn't an issue with my patch. After analysing the reports of the very few users who had issues with some scenes not triggering, here are 6 possible problems. **Go through all of them before reporting an issue!**
  
  
1. You did not run Nemesis after **installing, updating or changing** your OStim animation packs. You must do this every time you **install, update or change** your animation packs. You'd be surprised how many people forget to do this. 
  
  
2. Scenes are not triggering only with a certain NPC -> no idea what causes this, but it's not exclusive to Amorous Adventures. This is happening even in normal OStim scenes triggered with the up arrow. We currently don't know if this is an issue with OStim or an issue with some other mods or load orders. Starting a new game or simply exiting Skyrim and reloading your save usually fixes the problem. There's nothing else I can do about this.
  
  
3. **Make sure you have version 3.4.0.3 Beta of the original Amorous Adventures for OStim mod**. I don't care if you **think** you have it, double check if you do! A user thought he had the latest version but turns out he didn't and that's why kiss and threesome scenes weren't triggering. So please, double check your versions!
  
  
4. Nothing works, nothing is triggered -> you probably have OStim as a whole installed incorrectly. Re-read the installation tutorial, if you still have issues join the Discord server for further help. In general, OStim is installed correctly if you can see the MCM menu properly and if you walk up to an NPC and press the Up arrow on your keyboard, a scene will start and you can control the animations. If this isn't the case, then OStim is not properly installed.
  
  
5. OStim scenes trigger properly when pressing the Up Arrow but not when started through Amorous Adventures -> test on a new game and see if Amorous Adventures still doesn't works. By using the Alternate Start mod, you can quickly do the Ralof Nordic Hospitality quest, or spawn in Whiterun, hire Jenassa, and start her quest. From there, you can quickly test the scenes triggered through AA dialogue. If it works on a New Game, your other save might need to be cleaned or otherwise has other issues, which is not a problem with my patch or with Amorous Adventures mod itself!
  
  
This isn't to say my patch is free of bugs. With Skyrim and coding in general, probably nothing ever is. So feel free to report any bug or problem you might have. But please, go through these 6 points in the list above first before reporting an issue!
  
  
**When reporting a bug in the comments or bugs section, provide as many details as possible, includind how you are starting scenes, the quest(s) or NPC(s) with problems, the logs in the ingame console (yes, OStim Standalone logs a ton of useful information there), anything that you might find relevant to help isolate the issue!**
  
  
Simply saying that "it doesn't work" really doesn't help me find the issue, and you'll be wasting my time and your time, and neither of us want that :)
  
  
  
**9) I found a bug or otherwise have suggestions that can improve this patch.**
  
  
If you found a bug, first make sure that you have installed OStim and all animations correctly. Most of the time people will have problems with their OStim installation. This isn't a problem with my patch! Go to the OStim page and [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/RECvhVaRcU) for support on that.
  
  
Otherwise, use the comments section. I will also gladly take in suggestions, but I don't guarantee to implement them. I will do my best to fix bugs, but understand that I have a life of my own and modding is not my job. I might take long to fix bugs or I might take just a few days. It will entirely depend on how busy I am at the moment with my personal life. Please respect that. If the mod is unusable for you for whatever reason, remember that uninstalling it has no risks as described in above questions.
