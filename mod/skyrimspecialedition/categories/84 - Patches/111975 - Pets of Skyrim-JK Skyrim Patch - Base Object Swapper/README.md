This moves Halvar's Journal and bedroll to outside of woodstair to make it accessable. As a bonus, a clipping barrel is also fixed by slightly moving it.
  
  
The difference with other patch is:
  
1. esp-free so less esp for you
  
2. fixed a clipping barrel 
  
3. the original woodstair placement from JK Skyrim is preserved
  
  
Enjoy!
