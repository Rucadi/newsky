Adds support for custom races in Wintersun: custom races that have the appropriate ActorProxy keyword attached to them will be treated as vanilla races and thus receive correct initial deity sugggestion as well as racial favor bonuses.
  
  
Also added keyword check for the blood collection quest.
  
  
Let me know if I missed something.
