# Project AHO - Spell Crafting for Mysticism

Adds some of [Mysticism - A Magic Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839)'s spell tomes to the tome crafting station added by [Project AHO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15996). Consistency patching was also done (for example, to make Detect Life spell use common filled soul gem, to make you use Sealed Spell of Illusion to get Paralyze spell tome instead of the alteration one).
  
  
This is ESLified ESP (won't count toward your plugins' limit).
  
Place the patch after both mods in your load order.
