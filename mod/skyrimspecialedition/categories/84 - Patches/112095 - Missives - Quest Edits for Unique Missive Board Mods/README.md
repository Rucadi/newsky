**Missives - Quest Edits for Unique Missive Board Mods**

  
  
**NOTE: If you install this midsave and try to go to a missive board that has already tried to generate missives and and it appears empty, you will have to wait the cooldown time (can vary based on MCM settings) until it's ready to regenerate more missives!!!!
  
It's best to test to make sure it works on a new save. If missives still fail to generate then check your list in xEdit for conflicts!!!!**
  
  
Small mod the edits the missive board alias in all the missive quests to allow them to generate in other containers if the missive board is replaced by another. Removes the condition that checks to make sure the container is the base container from missives and made it check the specific missive board reference instead, so that if something changes the base object, it still works. (ESL Flagged)
  
  
**Load directly after Missives.esp and RadEx\_Missives.esp if you have it (This is the lawbringer patch. It's changes are included in this patch) and make sure you load it before any other missive patch, like Headhunter Missives patch and Bounty Hunter missives patch.**
  
  
Any mod that edits the missive quests would need to forward the changes. The changes don't require this mod as a master, so I'd recommend including this change into your mod. I have forwarded this change into my [Bounty Hunter](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/109031) mod's missives patches and have provided an esp replacer for Jay's [Headhunter Missive patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51847).
