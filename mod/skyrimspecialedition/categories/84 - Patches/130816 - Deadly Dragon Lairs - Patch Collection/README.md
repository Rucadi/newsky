[FuzzBeed](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/TheOneTrueFuzzBeed/about-me?gameId=1704) and I have been grinding for months to get [Deadly Dragon Lair Locations - FuzzBeed's Dragon Lairs AIO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/129681) out the door and I am happy to say we've finally done it.  Please bother me if you have an issue with my patches not the original mod authors. These patches were made by me ChickenMike and not [TheOneTrueFuzzBeed](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/52991701). All plugins are .ESL flagged .ESPs so they won't take up a place in your load order.
  
  

IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU ADD THESE PATCHES TO A NEW GAME. To quote [robertgk2017](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5544506) "Modding is illegal post character start."﻿ You might be able to get away with it if you haven't entered the exterior cell yet but this is neither recommended nor supported. 
  
  
These patches require [BEES](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441) to function properly on older game versions.

PATCHES
  
﻿

[Better Dynamic Snow SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9121) - Ensures a sarcophagus is in the correct position and has snow on it. This plugin does not have Better Dynamic Snow as a marked master to ensure it works with all versions. Ensure the patch loads after both the BDS ESP as well as the Dragon lairs ESP.

[Lawbringer - Guardsman](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67003) - Conflict resolution on the bandit chief record and makes some objects disappear when they should.

[Run For Your Lives](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2272) - Conflict resolution on some dragon perch markers. This plugin is not needed if you load Run For Your Lives before Deadly Dragon Lairs
  
  

FAQ﻿

﻿
  
Q:Why does your thumbnails look like you just took FuzzBeed's thumbnail and threw a text box over it in PowerPoint?
  
A: I don't know how to do thumbnails and FuzzBeed said it was cool so thats I did. Also I'm lazy and you're not my dad. 
  
  
Q:Do these patches work with my game version?
  
A:as long as you use [BEES](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441) you should be fine.
  
  
Q:Wow these patches sure look complicated to do how did you make them?
  
A:Truthfully it's not that complicated. It took me like an hour to learn the like an hour to learn the CK and to be honest you should already know how to use SSEedit. Janquel's guide﻿ is an invaluable resource and without it I wouldn't have known where to even start. If I can do it you can too!
  
  
Q:FOMOD?
  
A: Its 7 plugins. no
  
  
Q:Do you take patch requests?
  
A:My primary reason for making patches is personal use but if I can make the patch quickly I'll consider it. 
  
  
Q:You haven't had any recent activity on Nexus and I need to get a hold of you, how can I do that?
  
A:@ChickenMike in either Ryn, or Janquel's discords and I should see it. I'm also in a bunch of other discords, but I check those two the most regularly.
  
  
Q:Why are you missing so many screenshots?
  
A:I'm lazy and taking screenshots is super tedious and I hate it.
