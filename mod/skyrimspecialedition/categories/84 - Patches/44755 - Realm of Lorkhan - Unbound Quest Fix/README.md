# Realm of Lorkhan - Unbound Quest Fix
- Author: TheRetroCarrot

This should fix the bug in the current version of Realm of Lorkhan preventing "Unbound" from being marked as complete in your journal. It will also fix the issue where when Alduin flies out of Helgen the first time you go there, the weather would change to cloudy. This will work for SSE and VR.
  
  
Realm of Lorkhan is required, load this ESP after.
