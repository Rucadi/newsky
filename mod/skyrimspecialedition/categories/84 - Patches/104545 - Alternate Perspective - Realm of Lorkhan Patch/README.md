I like Alternate Perspective and I like Realm of Lorkhan and I wanted to use them together, so now you can be the shezarrine with helgen undestroyed
  
  
so now you can have all the options that Realm of Lorkhan provides with non of the dragon urgency if you wish.
  
  
not sure i've done everything perfectly since both mods do a lot but i've yet to notice any issues, but if you notice any issues that this mod doesn't address let me know.
  
  
Update:
  
  
Updated for Alternate Perspective Version 4 and Fixed issue where you are given the Teleport to Realm of Lorkhan ability even when you choose a different start
