This is a small synergy patch for "[CC´s Camping Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73354)" by [xGasilx](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/133056758) and [Campfire](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/667) by [Chesko](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/187943) (and optionally [Sorcerer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/95196) by [SimonMagus616](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/67410746) & Team).
  
  
There are two versions of this patch available.
  
  
Version 1:
  
With this patch, you can still drop the camping supplies from the Camping Expansion mod as usual. However, the fireplace won't be automatically lit. Instead, an unlit campfire from Chesko's mod will be placed. You'll need to light it yourself (I personally prefer using the simple lighting method for this, but you can adjust it according to your preferences in Campfire's Mod Configuration Menu). I have removed the cooking and smelting pot from the Camping Expansion, but you can place Chesko's cooking pot and reactivate the smelter if you wish.
  
  
Version 2:
  
This version of the patch is identical to Version 1, but additionally, if you use the Advanced Camping Supplies from the Camping Expansion mod, it will replace the alchemy lab and enchanting table with a Scroll Enchanter and a Staff Enchanter from SimonMagus' Sorcerer mod. Please note that this version requires Sorcerer to be installed.
  
  
I have personally tested both versions, and I haven't encountered any issues. If you happen to come across any problems, please do let me know.
  
  
There is a patch in the optional files. It will put out the fire and refund remaining fuel. Kindly provided by [GiraPomba](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/20507499).
