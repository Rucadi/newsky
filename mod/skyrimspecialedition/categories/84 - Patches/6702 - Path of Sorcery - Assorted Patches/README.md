A collection of patches for steelfeather's [Path of Sorcery - Magic Perk Overhaul](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6660/) v3.0 (PoS). More patches may be added as time permits.
  
  
**Adept - Magic of Ash**
  
A patch for HeirOfTheSeptems's [Adept - Magic of Ash](https://www.patreon.com/posts/adept-magic-of-0-65784179) allowing the new spells to benefit from PoS perks.
  
  
**Apocalypse - Magic of Skyrim Patch**
  
A patch for version 9.45.0 of EnaiSiaion's [Apocalypse - Magic of Skyrim](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1090/) allowing the new spells to benefit from PoS perks.
  
  
**Creation Club**
  
Individual patches for the various Creations which add new spells, allowing them to benefit from PoS perks. With the release of Path of Sorcery 3.0, these patches have been updated for consistency with the official PoS AE patch. Please note, the Rare Curios and Saint & Seducers patches require [FormList Manipulator](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74037).
  
  
**Immersive Sounds - Compendium Patch**
  
A small patch to resolve the changes made to certain magic effects by both PoS and lazyskeever's [Immersive Sounds Compendium](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/523/).
  
  
**J'zargo Dialogue Fix**
  
A fix to resolve a small issue with J'zargo's dialogue caused PoS. When J'zargo is first encountered at the College of Winterhold, he asks if you have mastered the expert destruction spells, with your possible responses dependent on whether or not you have the Expert Destruction perk. As that particular perk isn't used in PoS, it becomes impossible to tell J'zargo, "Yes, I have". This fix replaces the perk condition with one based on having a Destruction skill of 75 or higher. It also carries forward a couple changes USLEEP makes to one of the records.
  
  
**Reach Magic**
  
A patch for HeirOfTheSeptems's [Reach Magic](https://www.patreon.com/posts/reach-magic-v1-0-65777188)﻿ allowing the new spells to benefit from PoS perks.
