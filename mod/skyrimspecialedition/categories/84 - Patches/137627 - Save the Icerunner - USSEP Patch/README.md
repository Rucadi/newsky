# Save the Icerunner - USSEP Patch

USSEP adds a missing keyword to Ironback Hideout and Orphan's Tear so that radiant quests can send you there. However, Save the Icerunner depends on Ahtar's quest only being able to send you to Broken Oar Grotto, so it reverts USSEP's changes to ensure you'll get the quest item. I used [Favor Quests Separated](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73903) to change the location requirement for this specific quest from LocTypeBanditLair to LocTypeBrokenOarGrotto, without affecting any of the other "Kill the Bandit Leader" quests.
  
  
Things to note:
  

  
* With or without this patch, Ahtar won't offer his quest until you've spoken with Jaree-Ra.
If you use [Skyrim Realistic Conquering](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26396)﻿, load it after this patch.
