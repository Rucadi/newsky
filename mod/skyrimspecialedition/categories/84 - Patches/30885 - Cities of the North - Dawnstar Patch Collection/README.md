While building a modlist, I wanted to include [Cities of the North - Dawnstar](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28952) for its unique building designs, however it ran into a number of conflicts with item placements for other mods which I used. This resulted in a bit of a rabbit hole, teaching myself how to use the CK in addition to xEdit, and creating a series of patches which I felt others could use. This is my first time uploading something, so please bear with me, and I hope you enjoy. Each mod which has a patch is listed below, with specific details of all changes contained in spoilers. All patches are ESP flagged as ESL, so they will not take up load order space (unless you're at the thousands of patches level). As I'm now moving into maintenance mode, I'm adding which version of the parent mods is the most recent one I've actively taken a look at. If parent mods continue to update further, these patches may not work as intended, or may not do everything they're supposed to do.

[The Great Cities - Minor Cities and Towns](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20272) ﻿- Patch which applies the same changes as The Great City of Dawnstar patch, but to the AIO version of The Great Cities. Last checked against version 2.01

[Immersive Citizens - AI Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/173) - designed for version 0.4.0.2 Four patches available.
  
  
Spoiler• Base patch - forwards updates to objects/markers in various interiors. Moves added markers/objects to new locations to match the new interiors - please note that all changes here are subjective on my part, and may not reflect the vision of the original mod, most notably the cot location and the dancing/celebration markers in the Windpeak Inn. Due to the complete rewrite of the Windpeak Inn, the navmesh changes from COTN - Dawnstar are forwarded to overwrite AI Overhaul's. After re-reading Shurah's message, I realized I could clean up the navmesh if I used his as the base, so I've done so, along with fixing some landscape issues to prevent gaps/grass/etc. The only adjustment to placement of objects/markers was to lower them to match the new landscape. I tested the behavior quite a bit, so no issues should arise, but if any were to do so, bother me, not ICAIO folks - it's definitely something on my end.
  
• 3DNPC patch - If using the complete patch for 3DNPC, there is one chair in the Windpeak Inn which is touched by all three mods - this forwards the changes from the previous ones, so they play well together. Include after the base patch. I don't have a version for the "Interiors Only" one right now, but will put one together if someone asks - I'm guessing this won't be a very interesting usage case for folks, though :)
  
• JKs Skyrim - No longer requires base patch as a master. Forwards updates to objects/markers in various interiors. Moves added markers/objects to new locations to match the new interiors - please note that all changes here are subjective on my part, and may not reflect the vision of the original mod, most notably the cot location and the dancing/celebration markers in the Windpeak Inn. Due to the complete rewrite of the Windpeak Inn, the navmesh changes from COTN - Dawnstar are forwarded to overwrite AI Overhaul's. After re-reading Shurah's message, I realized I could clean up the navmesh if I used his
  
as the base, so I've done so, along with fixing some landscape issues toprevent gaps/grass/etc. The end of JK's dock (and the corresponding scaffold changes) have been removed to prevent clipping with the ferryman campsite. No references/markers with ICAIO have been touched in this case, just adjustment of landscape/navmesh to match (and prevent grass clipping). I tested the behavior quite a bit, so no issues should arise, but if any were to do so, bother me, not ICAIO or JK - it's definitely something on my end.
  
• ra2phoenix's all-in-one patch adjusts the placement of some of the added objects down by the ferry for ICAIO. Its placement conflicts with Arthmoor's Dawnstar by default, and this patch takes care of that. Additionally, it rolls back CFTO changes (CFTO makes a duplicate of NPCs and disables the original ones), and applies the dialogue/etc from CFTO to the vanilla NPC. It's been thoroughly tested and the ferry behavior works, as well as all expected AI behavior of the ferryman from ICAIO is being done properly, without touching any packages or quests. There's already a CFTO-ICAIO patch, but when I tested it out, the ferryman wasn't sandboxing correctly with that patch, so I'm not sure the patch does everything it should do? At least not in Dawnstar. xEdit manipulation would require that patch to work with this one, but given it does not seem to do what the original patch *should*, I did not want to include it as a master. Specific changes relative to ICAIO are including everything in the base patch, while also moving the campfire/ferryman markers to match new exterior.
  
  
There used to be an interiors only patch but it's been removed. It's still available in the old files area.
  
  
[Immersive College of Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17004) - Shifts scrying location to (hopefully) cover the new interior. Last checked against version 6.2
  
  
[Immersive Wenches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/595) - moves a bunch of markers to match the new interiors, primarily sweeping markers in The White Hall. Last checked against version 1.60SE
  
  
[Inncredible](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/790) - Resolves conflicts so that COTN Dawnstar's interior is the interior usedin Morthal, and Inncredible can be used for other inns. If using Inncredible's 3DNPC patch, load COTN Dawnstar's 3DNPC and Inncredible's patches below it. Note: parent mod has some deleted vanilla navmeshes, etc - that's not something that can be fixed in a patch. Last checked against version 1.3.1. No longer supported - available only in miscellaneous files.
  
  
[Keep it Clean](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17846) - Moves the trapdoor and added towels to a new location within the new interior of the Windpeak Inn. If using, load after any other mods that modify inn interior (RRR, ICAIO, etc). Last checked against version 3.15a
  
  
[Kozakowy's Mythic Dawn Priestess Outfit](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50134) - Shifts the chest in Siluss' house to match the new interior. Last checked against version 1.2.1
  
  
[Lanterns of Skyrim II](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30817) ﻿- Two patches available - one for with JKs Skyrim, one without. Only install ONE patch. Special thanks to wizkid for keying me in to what changes were needed for the newly added objects to also toggle with his MCM, confirmed to be working. Last checked against version 4.0.
  
  
[Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802) ﻿- Moves placed gems/sulfur in every house to match new interior. Moves fliers/drunk marker in Windpeak Inn to match new interior. Moves placed object in Dawnstar Museum to match new interior. Moves three barrels outside the Windpeak Inn to prevent clipping with museum shipping crates, if enabled. Works with/without JKs Skyrim, no other city overhauls tested, but exterior changes are small enough it should work with most any. Last checked against version 6.3
  
  
[Leviathan Axe](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40364) - Shifts a scroll to match new interior. Last checked against version 1.0beta
  
  
[Medieval Lanterns of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27622)/[JKs Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6289) - Re-upload/cleanup of the patches which used to be on COTN Dawnstar's page. Simply put, this fixes two lanterns - one was partially in the geometry in the first patch, and the second lantern was either floating in the air, or the wrong lantern type, depending upon whether the MLOS - JKs patch or the COTN Dawnstar - JKs patch won between their two. This combines both of those edits, along with all the other COTN/MLOS patch edits. I don't know what version that patch was based off of.
  
  
[Mihail Handicapped Citizens](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63235) - Shifts NPC spawn point to be inside new interior. Last checked against version 1.1

[Morrowloot Ultimate](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3058) - Shifts one necklace spawn to match new interior. Last checked against version 1.57
  
  
[Morskom Estate](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33408) ﻿- resolves a couple conflicts, gets the navmesh/landscape to play with one another. Last checked against version 3.0
  
  
[Mystic Condenser](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10176) - Fixes placement of the Mystic Condenser put in The White Hall. Last checked against version 2.3
  
  
[Mythos](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51576) - Shifts a bounty note to match new interior. Last checked against version Redux
  
  
[No Snow Under the Roof](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/518) - provides edited meshes for buildings to look right with NSUTR, as well as a re-upload of the COTN Dawnstar NSUTR patch.
  
  
[JKs Skyrim - No Snow Under the Roof](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17026) ﻿- requires the patch at the above link, the NSUTR patch from COTN, and the JKs patch from COTN, all as masters.  This just makes them all play well with one another, so there shouldn't be any more random floating snow. Last checked against version 1.
  
  
[Off Limits](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71109) - Shifts the off limits areas to match new interiors (includes one additional region in Windpeak Inn). Last checked against version 1.1
  
  
[Open Civil War](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11076) - Moves a set stage trigger back over the opening of The White Hall entrance, matching the new layout. Patch was generated for revision 2.6.1 of OCW, looks good for 2.6.3
  
  
[Outlaws Refuges](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8445) - slight shift of the trapdoor to the Dawnstar refuge to match new exterior. Alternative version to tie into the JKs/Arthmoor's navmesh provided by ra2phoenix. Last checked against version 1.2.
  
  
[Perseids Inns and Taverns - Realistic Room Rental](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24859) ﻿- Lets COTN Dawnstar win all conflicts with RRR, but places two interactive mead barrels and the wash basin which are part of RRR (and scripts reference) into the new interior. Load order matters here, due to compatibility patches which conflict with one another. Load COTN/RRR in any order relative to one another, then all RRR patches, then the COTN - RRR patch, and finally all other COTN compatibility patches. Behavior will be potentially erratic otherwise. Last checked against version 1.8.9.001.

[Thrones of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41198) - Created for use with, but does not require Thrones of Skyrim. Adds a small dais under the throne in the White Hall, and shifts a few things in the banquet table to match the new layout. Navmesh is untouched, and probably should be, but all NPCs seemed to route just fine behind the table so I figured better to leave well enough alone.

(older, worse, versions of these patches available in the old files section), [Mihail's Crows](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60832) (and [another Mihail's Crows which has Morthal, too](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/104487), [Simplicity of Snow](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58559), [Skyrim Unbound Reborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68994), [Better Dynamic Snow](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52111)
  
*Installation*
  
Use a mod manager/organizer to install, or drop the loose files into your Skyrim data folder. Patches should have their appropriate masters set, and should be loaded after any mods which they are patching. Some of the fixes in question are on persistent objects, and may require a new save.
  
  
*Compatibility*
  
I don't believe this should introduce any incompatibilities beyond anything which may be present between base mods. Let me know if you hit anything
