List of changes:
  
  
Conjure Lurker summons an actual Requiem-Lurker instead of a vanilla replica.
  
Poison resist debuff removed from various spells. (It was too strong)
  
Magicka cost, spell magnitude and summon durations adjusted for Requiem.
  
Spellbooks renamed to "Abyssal Tome - <SpellName>" and prices adjusted.
  
Levelled item lists reqtified. You will find the spelltomes placed around Apocrypha and in random containers in Apocrypha.
  
Novice spells changed to apprentice. (No need to have novice spells gated behind apocrypha, especially in Requiem)
  
  
Installation:
  
  
Use a mod manager and run the Reqtificator.
