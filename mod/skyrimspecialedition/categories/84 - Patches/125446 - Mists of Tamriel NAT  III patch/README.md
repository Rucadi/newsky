# Mists of Tamriel NAT  III patch
- Author: Strife
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

Integrates Mists of Tamriel effects into NAT weathers. Meant to be used with True storms and my patch for it which takes the best from all three mods and puts them together, while letting NAT III control all weathers so it wont mess up your load order.
  
  
If using all of them it should be Mists of Tamriel ---> Truestorms ---> Nat III ---- True Storms / NAT patch ---> This Patch
