**SkyPatcher meets Lux**[SkyPatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106659)﻿ now supports interior cells! To celebrate, I present to you: Lux – SkyPatcher!
  
  
This patch enables better compatibility between Lux and any mod that edits vanilla interior cells. This only covers vanilla cells. [Manual patching](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/113002) will still be required for bigger overhauls. Minor mods, that only add, change or move objects, will now no longer break your Lux interiors and will be compatible out of the box.
  
  
[SkyPatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106659)patches all loaded plugins that override vanilla cells and applies Lux default lighting settings to ensure visual consistency and compatibility with your load order — even if no patch exists or existing ones are overridden by other mods.
  
  
  
**Features**
  

  
* Automatic interior patching for Lux when patches are missing or overridden by other mods.
Cells that are already patched by Lux or Lux patches **will be ignored**.
  
* Ensures **compatibility where patches are missing** and visual consistency
Works with *any* mod that modifies vanilla interior cells
  

  
  
**Note:** This patch improves compatibility, but depending on your load order and the mods you're using, **additional manual patching is still necessary for best results**. For that visit the [Lux - Patch Hub](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/113002)
