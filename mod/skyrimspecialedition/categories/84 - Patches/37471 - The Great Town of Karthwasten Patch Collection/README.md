# The Great Town of Karthwasten Patch Collection
- Author: Janquel
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37471
Continuing with my series of "I want to run with unique architecture everywhere, but that requires SO MANY compatibility patches" series....Karthwasten! soldierofwar put together an overhaul of Karthwasten in his [The Great Town of Karthwasten](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33032)﻿, and I've put together a series of compatibility patches for things in
  
my load order which needed it. This one is rather small - not that many things which needed to be patched, and I've avoided reinventing the wheel for any patches that exist elsewhere. All patches are ESP flagged as ESL, unless otherwise noted. Please note that I've been sitting on these patches for a bit, because soldierofwar is planning on revisiting this town at some point, so if The Great Town of Karthwasten moves past revision 1.1, they may no longer be accurate.

[Enhanced Lights and FX](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2424) ﻿- Only one patch this time around, due to there being a new building and wanting to keep consistency in lighting mood across all of
  
 them. Forwards any conflicts having Great Town of Karthwasten win, shifted door lights, etc, where appropriate. Last checked against version 3.06. Please note that these buildings will be much brighter than typical ELFX buildings.

[Verdant](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2296) Patch - DOES NOT REQUIRE VERDANT AS MASTER. Verdant adds grass to a couple texture types which makes a few paths seem more overgrown than they should have. This patch re-paints those stretches to be types which don't have grass, for Verdant. It may assist with other grass mods that do the same, as well, so master is not set.
  
  
Other patches I'm aware of: [Immersive Laundry](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42423?), [Medieval Lanterns of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65198)
  
  
*Installation*
  
Use a mod manager/organizer to install, or drop the loose files into you Skyrim data folder. Patches should have their appropriate masters set, and should be loaded after any mods which they are patching. Some of the fixes in question are on persistent objects, and may require a new save.
  
  
*Compatibility*
  
I don't believe this should introduce any incompatibilities beyond anything which may be present between base mods. All moved objects should have been moved to locations which are non-overlapping. Let me know if you hit anything
