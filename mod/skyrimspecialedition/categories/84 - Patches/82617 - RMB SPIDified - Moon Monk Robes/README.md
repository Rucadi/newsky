# RMB SPIDified - Moon Monk Robes

**What does this patch cover?**
  
This patch is more of a world integration patch, first and foremost introducing the outfit to various named NPCs. Khajiit Bandits also have a chance to equip the outfit.
  
  
Due to being a SPID patch/adaptation, it avoids a need for compatibility patches.
  
  
If you have any suggestions (such as characters to distribute to / not distribute to) or run into any issues, please let me know.
  
  
[SPID for Lunar Guard Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/82698) is recommended as a complementary combination, as they avoid overlap regarding distribution.
  
  
**Features**
  

  
* ESL Light Plugin (doesn't use a slot), to define the outfits
Introduces (**25**) new outfits, used in outfit distribution
  
* Outfits are distributed to (**20**) named Khajiit NPCs, many wearing no helmet - but some using one regardless (if they wore a hood, they have a chance of wearing a mask)
If you have Interesting NPCs, outfits have also been distributed to (**19**) named Khajiit NPCs
  
* If you have Moonpath to Elsweyr, outfits have also been distributed to (**7**) named Khajiit NPCs
Outfits are also distributed to Khajiit Bandits, with a 20% chance. Currently Khajiit Bandits will wear a mismatch mix
  
* Masks have a 50% chance of being equipped by Bandits, when they are fortunate enough to get an outfit
Bandit / Generic Distribution is handled within rmb\_a\_moon\_monk\_DISTR.ini
  
* Named / Unique Distribution is handled within rmb\_a\_[color=#ffd966]moon\_monk\_named\_DISTR.ini[/color]

Alternatively, the excellent [Khajiit Has Wears by allonsywisegirl](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/79540) covers Moon Monk Robes, Lunar Guard Armor and some other plugins with an all-in-one approach. Mind that Khajiit Has Wears does not introduce the equipment to Bandits and other mods such as Interesting NPCs - which may not necessarily be desired.

**Manual Tweaking**
  

  
* **How can I keep distribution to named NPCs only?**
    
  You can delete all entries inside rmb\_a\_moon\_monk\_DISTR.ini to restrict distribution to named/unique NPCs only
**How can I keep distribution to generic NPCs only?**
  
You can delete all entries inside rmb\_a\_moon\_monk\_named\_DISTR.ini, which will remove distributions to named NPCs* **I like that character x/y/z has this or that outfit, but I don't want other characters to get the outfits. How do I change this?**
    
  You can find the relevant entries inside rmb\_a\_moon\_monk\_named\_DISTR.ini. Each entry can be tweaked or removed as desired
**How can I restrict these outfits to specific genders?**
  
rmb\_a\_moon\_monk\_DISTR.ini has the relevant entries. You'll see each outfit, and will want to change one of the values. See below:[font=Courier New]Outfit = OUTFITID|isFactionBandit+ActorWeaponTypeOneHanded|NONE|NONE|[color=#ffd966]**NONE**|1|2[/color][/font]The highlighted **NONE** above can be changed to **M** or **F** to restrict to Male or Female respectively.
