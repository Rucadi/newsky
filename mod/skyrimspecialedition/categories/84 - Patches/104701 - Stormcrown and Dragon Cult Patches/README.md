**Wyrmstooth Patch**:  Integrates the Wyrmstooth Phantom Form shout as modified by Delta's Foreceful Tongue into Stormcrown.  Meditating on Phantom Form will negate fall damage while in Phantom Form.  Will receive Stormcrown duration buffs. 
  
  
An optional version is also provided that preserves the original Wyrmstooth shout "summons a phantom image to act as a decoy". Meditating on this version will summon two phantoms instead of one.
  
  
**Dragon Aspect Overhaul:** Patches and modifies Delta's Dragon Aspect Overhaul Shout; based off the power / once per day version.  The base effects take priority over Stormcrown changes to Dragon Aspect; however, the Meditation and the Black Book Epistolary Acumen benefits from Stormcrown will still apply and stack.  Will receive Stormcrown duration buffs.  Miraak will also have the overhauled Dragon Aspect.
  
  
Also adjusted a few oddities in the original Dragon Aspect Overhaul
  
  
**Iomaungandr Rising SE**: Simply forwards a condition pertaining to the Clear Skies Shout.
