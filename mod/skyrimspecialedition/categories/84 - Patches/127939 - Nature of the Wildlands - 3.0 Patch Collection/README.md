I love the new 3.0 release of Nature of the Wildlands but as it states on the mod page, most of the patches for 2.0 will probably no longer work. As a staple of my load order I decided i'd make a central page for all the patches I have made for mods I use personally.
  
  
**Some of these patches are made with my own personal touches for certain mods (for example, Oakwood now has a giant Oak in the centre of the town circle) and it's your choice whether you want the patch I made or any others that have been updated for 3.0 :)**
  
  
Massive thank you to [Pomelo8765](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/98703408) for [Nature of the Wildlands](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63604)Patches will be uploaded as I make them :) **PLEASE NOTE:** Some patches for 2.0 will probably still work but I made all of these from scratch with just Nature of the Wildlands 3.0 and the corresponding mods active to ensure full matching of assets, etc.
