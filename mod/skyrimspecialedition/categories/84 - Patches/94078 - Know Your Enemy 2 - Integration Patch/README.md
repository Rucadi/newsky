This is a patch that integrates the [creature](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93258) and [armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/94067) modules of Know Your Enemy 2. It can be installed at any time. It is not strictly required as both mods work together fine without it, but it does improve the experience. Specifically, it does the following:
  
  

  
1. Removes the armor module's inspect spell from the player.
Changes the function of the creature module's inspect spell to show resistances from both modules.
  
2. Removes the option of quantitative descriptions from the creature module's MCM as that is no longer supported by the integrated inspect spell.
Removes the option of inspecting living targets from the armor module's MCM as the armor module's inspect spell is removed.
  
3. Removes the unarmed attack fix from the armor module as it is in the creature module already and you only need it once.

  
Note that if you set the creature module's effect intensities to a different value than the armor module's NPC effect intensity then there is no consistent definition for what the inspect spell considers a "strong" or "regular" resistance. In these cases the inspect spell will use the armor module's definitions if the target is wearing a cuirass, otherwise it will use the creature module's definitions. Nonetheless, it is recommended to set these settings to the same value.
