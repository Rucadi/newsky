# Wyrmstooth VR Patch
- Author: TheRetroCarrot
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

﻿This is a complete overhaul of the scene in Wyrmstooth where you control a Draugr. This scene has you exit your body and control an AI, which does not function in VR. I have done my best to mimic this scenario in VR. You will be transported into the body of a Draugr, and returned to your existing body upon toggling the switch. Quest triggers have been kept in tact, and saving has been disabled during this scene to mitigate the potential for issues.
  
  
Spell effects, and details are added to make it feel authentic like the original.
