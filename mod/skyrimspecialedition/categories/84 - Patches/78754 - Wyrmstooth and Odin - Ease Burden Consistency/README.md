Wyrmstooth and Odin introduce the "Ease Burden" spell, which can result in two spells with the same effect (or similar effects) in your spell list.
  
What this little esp does is just two things:
  
- Make the Wyrmstooth Book teach the Odin Variant of the spell.
  
- Makes the value of the Wyrmstooth Book a bit higher to match the Odin Book one.
  
  
I tested it in the LAL cell with these two books, seems to work. Only "issue" I see is that if you read one book it doesnt count as the other one being read, because there are still two different books, just with the same effect and value. Anyone is welcome to unify these two books, but I dont feel comfortable in the CK enough to do that.
  
  
(If the makers of Wyrmstooth and/or Odin write to me and say they want me to take this patch down, I'll comply.)
