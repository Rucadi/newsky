Patch to disable the bound weapon spellbooks Animated Armory adds to the College of Winterhold library that ICOW will place new bookcases etc over top of. 
  
Added the bound weapon spellbooks to Urag's sales inventory.
  
  
Originally I was going to delete the spellbooks but some modders on LOTD discord gave me some good advice to just disable them instead.  Just wanted to say thanks.

I checked with Animated Armory and ICOW authors and both were ok with this patch being uploaded.
