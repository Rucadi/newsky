REQUIEM - BUBBLES BEGONE
  
  
For some reason recently my character started getting a swarm of bubbles surrounding them whenever they took an alcoholic drink. After much tearing my hair out I realised this was a recent (?) change introduced by Requiem. I don't know about you, but whenever I have a swig of ale I usually don't get lit up in a surrounding swarm of bubbles. Maybe after 10 ales perhaps...
  
  
This simply removes that silliness. That is all.
  
  
Install in your usual fashion. Requires Requiem for SSE obviously. ESLified esp.
