Don't tell me to clean the plugin, I was gonna do attack speed perks as well but my friend told me to not bother. If the non-conflicting overwrites bother you, run the plugin through QAC yourself, idk. I tested this for about 5 minutes before a demon spawn came through my computer screen and tried to take me away.
