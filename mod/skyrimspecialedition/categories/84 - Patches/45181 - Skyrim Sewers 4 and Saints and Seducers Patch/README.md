Recently learned how to make patches so I could make the Saints and Seducers Creation and Skyrim Sewers 4 mod play nice together. Moved the Solitude Western Sewer entrance closer to the entrance of Solitude since it was the first place I could put it that I was happy with. You don't actually need the Saints and Seducers Creation in order for this to work but it's sorta pointless without it tbh. 
  
  
I made this mod because I reckon there are probably some people out there that don't know how to actually do this since tbh I was one of those people like 2 hours ago. So if you don't know how or just can't be fucked to do it yourself then here ya go.
  
  
Update: Something goofed when ESLifying version 1.0 and LOOT flagged it as having FormIDs outside of what was allowed for ESL files, went through and managed to fix (I'm like 90% sure, I'm still new to this though so uh yeah sorry about that) it and make it an ESL, ran through LOOT and flag was gone.
