**Notes**
  
  
There are two versions. The **Lite** version just adds KYE2's resistances to the bestiary. The **Full** version also rearranges the bestiary categories to match KYE2's categorization system (e.g. the golem category is removed, etc.). Do not use the full version with other bestiary patches as they will expect the default categorization. If using the full version you must delete or hide the "creatures" folder from the bestiary mod (it is inside the interface folder).
  
  
Note that the bestiary can only display up to 8 resistances. Where creatures have more than 8 resistances the least important are omitted, but this is very rare. In all cases, KYE2's inspect spell remains intact and can be used for full information.
