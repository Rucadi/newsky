# Blackthorn - Renamed and Rebalanced NPCs Shops and Mine
- Author: ennervated

I've always loved building and living in Blackthorn but felt like many of the NPC and store names were anachronistic. I also found the mine to be overpowered.
  
  
This mod page has two files that work independently of each other:
  
  

  
* **Renamed**: To improve ~\*immersion\*~, Blackthorn's residents and shops now follow the vanilla naming scheme. I also gave the miners names, improved the writing in some notes, and corrected grammatical and spelling errors throughout the mod. You'll find the full list of changes below. Flagged as ESL.
**Rebalanced**: The mine now only contains Iron and Conundrum ore veins. (Originally, the mine contained Conundrum, Ebony, Iron, Malachite, Orichalchum, Quicksilver, *and* Silver ore veins. A lot, I know.) Obviously it makes amassing building resources more difficult. Flagged as ESL.
  

  
I updated containers, activators, etc. to reflect the new names, but it's highly likely that I missed something.
  
Please leave a comment if you find anything that needs fixing!
  
  
**Information**
  
  
NPC name changes:
  
Spoiler
  
Names sourced from UESP.  I tried matching the vibe and the first few letters of the original names.
  
  
I retained the following NPC names:
  
  

  
* Annette, Hal, and Rona because they reasonably sound like Nord names
Dune, Jade, and Slate because they sound like chosen or fake names (think "Sapphire" of the Thieves Guild)
  

  
**[NORDS](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Nord_Names)**
  
  

  
* Annabelle -> Anrunn
Angie -> Agnetha
  
* Belle -> Belofa
Brooke -> Brunka
  
* Christopher -> Carth
Falco -> Farro
  
* Fresco -> Frenjor
Grace -> Grida
  
* Hetfield -> Helthar
Izzi -> Islinne
  
* Janet -> Janekke
Jules -> Julni
  
* Lana -> Lynie
Neko -> Narrek
  
* Owen -> Ollfar
Selena -> Seline
  
* Winston -> Wisten

  
**[BRETONS](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Breton_Names)**
  
  

  
* Farah -> Florine
Tamara -> Talara
  
* Zylan -> Zaros

  
[IMPERIALS](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Imperial_Names)
  
  

  
* Karen -> Kerelia
Sam -> Samuel
  
* Randolph -> Rudolphus

  
**MINERS**
  
  
In the original mod, the miners are simply called "Miner", whereas in vanilla, miners have given names.
  
The Nord miners are now called Arvid, Olav, Freya, and Kark. [Definitely not a reference.](https://i.imgur.com/wKHWzuK.jpeg) The Redguard miner is Ramand.
  
  
  
Shop name changes:
  
Spoiler
  

  
* Blackthorn Elexirs [sic] -> The Canis Cure - Named after the Canis Root, which is native to The Rift.
Blackthorn Mine -> Hearthstone Mine - Named as such because it has enough ores for you to build a home. Or a town.
  
* Edgewater Tavern -> Edgewater Inn - Because vanilla inns are named "\_\_\_\_\_ Inn", not "\_\_\_\_\_ Tavern".
Farah's Pelts and Hides -> The Broken Bone - A reference to Bone Break Fever, a disease contracted from bears, of which there are SO MANY in The Rift.
  
* Hal's Smithing Supplies -> The Iron Halberd - Is Hal's full name "Halberd"? We may never know.
Selens's Novals [sic] -> Seline's Scrolls - Because I like alliteration.
  
  
  
NPC house changes:
  
Spoiler
  

  
* Farmhouse -> Samuel and Kerelia's House
Neko's House -> Narrek's House
  
* Owen & Annette's House -> Ollfar and Annette's House
