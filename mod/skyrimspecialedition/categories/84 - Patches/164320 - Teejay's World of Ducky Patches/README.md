As always, I have found some stuff that needed patching for some of the location overhauls I use after installing a mod; this time it's [daedaddy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/12515909)'s [World of Ducky](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/144138), so here are my patches for the locations I've found need their duck moved. Haven't found all of them yet, so more may be added, but here's the list of patched locations thus far: 
  
  
  
[Cities of the North Dawnstar](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28952)
  
[JK's Blue Palace](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45324)
  
[JK's Jorrvaskr](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60738)
  
[JK's Windhelm Outskirts](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86975)
  
[Snazzy Interiors - Whiterun House Battle-Born](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/91121)
  
[Snazzy Interiors - Whiterun House Gray-Mane](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/91505)
  
[The Great City Of Winterhold SSE Edition](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17127)
  
[Thuldor's Ivarstead](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99494)
  
  
  
As of now, I don't intend to support overhauls I don't actively use in my Wabbajack list, but these are all standalone as long as you have the mods it's patching for. The JK's Blue Palace patch also requires the patch from [JK's Interiors Patch Collection](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35910).
  
  
  
IMPORTANT NOTE: these patches are provided to move the ducks without modifying the buffs obtained. If you use the Legacy of the Dragonborn patch, you will want to pick the vanilla patch option.
