**Wintersun - Anniversary Edition Patches**

**Description**
  
  
This mod consists of two patches for Skyrim Anniversary Edition that fix minor inconsistencies regarding the new shrines added in the Ghosts of the Tribunal and Gallows Hall creations. Specifically:
  
  
**Ghosts of the Tribunal**
  
  
Replaced the blessings the Tribunal shrines give with unique blessings modeled off the ones originally given in Morrowind.  Previously they gave blessings of the divines, which would cause pop-ups for those divines when praying to them .
  
  
This mod does **NOT** add the Tribunal as worshipable deities to Wintersun.
  
  
**Gallows Hall**
  
  
Edits the shrine of Vaermina added by this mod to give Vaermina's blessing from Wintersun. 
  
  
**Installation**
  
Each patch is available for download separately on this page. Install using MO2 or Vortex.  Load after Wintersun.  Individual patches do not have any conflicts with each other.
  
  
Patches are already in ESP-FE format. Will work with AE or SE exe.
  
  
**Future Plans**
  
Aside from the Tribunal integration described above, will also look into adding integration to The Cause or other CC mods as needed, I just haven't had a chance to play through them yet.
