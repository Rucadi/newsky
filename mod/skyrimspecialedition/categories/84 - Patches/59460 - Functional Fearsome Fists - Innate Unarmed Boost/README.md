**Overview:**
  
  
Functional Fearsome Fists adds a perk when equipping any of the Fearsome Fists gauntlets that boosts your unarmed damage based on the gauntlets' material. **Changes made:**
  
  
- The boost is added via perk and therefore allows you to enchant the gauntlets at your leisure (this includes adding an unarmed increasing enchantment). It will stack with any other unarmed increasing perks, such as the vanilla Fists of Steel perk or Khajiit Claws, but does not scale as you level (there is no unarmed skill).
  
  
- The crafted and distributed fists are now all the same type, coming without any enchantment due to the built in boost.
  
  
- The names of the Fearsome Fists gauntlets have been changed from their original "Brawler's <Material> Gauntlets" to "<Material> Brawling Gauntlets" so they show next to the rest of that material's equipment.
  
  
- Also adds the same perk boost to the Gauntlets of the Pugilist, which are also changed to look like the Fur Brawling Gauntlets.
  
  
**Damage:**
  
  
Taken from raw numbers alone, these may seem high, however, when you factor in the lack of a skill line boosting your damage output as you grow, these aren't actually as strong as they might seem in a vacuum.
