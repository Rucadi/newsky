Zim's Improved Dremora reverts USSEP changes back to vanilla.
  
  
I've forwarded the changes where it makes sense, while preserving the modifications/additions made in Zim's Improved Dremora.
  
  
I also increased the level scaling of the highest encounter variant of Dremora by 20%
  
  
Requires USSEP and Zim's Imporved Dremora... Download and Install both and then this patch.
