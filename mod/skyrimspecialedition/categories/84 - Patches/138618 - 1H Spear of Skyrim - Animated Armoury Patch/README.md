# 1H Spear of Skyrim - Animated Armoury Patch

So maybe I've watched the movie "300" a few times too many.  Or maybe I just want to try something a little different and play with ~~sword and board~~ spear and shield for a change, or even as a ~~spellsword~~ spellspear !?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
  
  
There are several great spear mods here on Nexus, but almost all of them treat the spear as a two handed weapon, and usually use battleaxe or greatsword animations.  Animated Armoury by NickaNack changed all that by adding new weapon animation sets for pike and halberd.  Spear of Skyrim by Nukanekom3260 added their own spears, and then Thalmor Justiciar 7th converted them to one handed models.  The one handed models allowed equipping a shield or spell in the left hand, but use vanilla 1H sword animations, so they're hack and slash.
  
  
What this patch does is add the AA "rapier" keyword to the 1H spears, so that they're now thrusting/stabbing weapons.
  
  
INSTALLATION
  
  

  
* Install [Animated Armoury DAR version](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35978) .  I personally use it with OAR and it seems to work.
Install [Spear of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89785?tab=description)﻿ for the assets.  You can use the original ESP or not, but it's flagged as an ESL so might as well keep it and get one of the other patches that will let the 2H versions use halberd or pike animations.
  
* Install [Spear of Skyrim 1H Conversion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/133069) - also flagged as an ESL
Please remember to endorse all of those mods for the great work those authors did!
  
* Install my patch (you are here)﻿.  Also flagged as an ESL, which won't count against your 255 plugin limit.﻿
