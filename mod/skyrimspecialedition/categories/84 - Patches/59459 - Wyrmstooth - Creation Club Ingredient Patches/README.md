**What does this mod do?**
  
This mod patches Wyrmstooth's harvestable plants to instead use Rare Curios and/or The Cause's versions.
  
  
**Rare Curios:**
  
  
Bog Beacon and Fungus Stalk plants will now give the corresponding Rare Curios ingredient. Placed instances of these ingredients have been swapped to the Rare Curios version.
  
  
**The Cause:**
  
  
Spiddal Stick plants and ingredients have been swapped to use the assets from The Cause. All relevant dialogue and quest data has also been updated.
