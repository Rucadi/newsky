Backpacks added by Creation Club Adventurer's Backpacks are very overpowered items in my opinion, I was looking for some mod to balance it according to Campfire's Backpack stats, but I didn't find one, so I did it, that's it.
  
  
  
**Technical stuff:**
  
  
*original*
  
Value: 5 ~ 15 
  
Armor rating: 1
  
Weight: 1
  
Carry Weight bonus: +75 points
  
Attributes (eg stamina): +20 points
  
craftable at blacksmith Forge (4x Leather + 1x Corundum Ingot)
  
  
*this patch:*
  
Value 45 ~ 50 
  
Weight: 5 
  
Armor rating: 0
  
Carry Weight bônus: +50 points
  
Attributes (eg stamina): +5 points
  
craftable at Tanning Rack (8x Leather strips + 2x Fur Plate)
  
The nomenclature has also changed, now these items have the prefix "*Backpack, [...]*" (as seen in Campfire), this should keep the inventory more organized as well.
  
  
Now, the difference between Campfire's backpacks and CC's backpacks are just visuals - there is no more "better or worse".
  
Leveled Lists have not been changed (CC stuff uses its own quest injection thing).
  
  
  
**Requirements:**
  
Adventurer's Backpack (paid mod, available at Creation Club)
  
Campfire
  
  
  
**Complete Crafting Overhaul Remade** is not required, however, CCOR "conditions" have also been added (so, if you disable "pouches" in CCOR MCM, you will not see any backpack).
  
  
-.ESP(esl flagged), very simple/small plugin - can be easily merged in whatever you want.
  
-Skyrim VR compatible?
  
No idea, I think yes?
  
-Skyrim 2011 backport?
  
No, come on, if you know how to convert CC stuff to Skyrim 2011, then you should definitely know how to convert a simple patch like this too.[/left]
