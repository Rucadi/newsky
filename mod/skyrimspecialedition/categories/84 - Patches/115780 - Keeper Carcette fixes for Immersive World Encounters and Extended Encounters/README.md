I noticed after I bumped into Keeper Carcette out in the wild, as a result of [Immersive World Encounters](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18330)﻿﻿ by SetteLisette, that she doesn't offer restoration training like she does at the Hall of the Vigilant. This is a simple patch to fix that, Carcette is now able to offer training on the road.
  
  
**Bonus Fixes:**

  
* Carcette is supposed to offer restoration training up to skill level 75, but a vanilla bug prevents the dialogue option from showing up if the players' restoration skill is over 50. This patch fixes that, and I've added a version where the skill cap is raised to 90.

  
* ﻿When encountering Carcette on the road, if you ask her about the Vigilants she will talk about herself in the third person saying "Keeper Carcette is the leader of our order..." This is because that dialogue line is only excluded *inside* the Hall of the Vigilant, so Carcette will say it if she moves away from the area, which obviously doesn't happen without mods. This patch simply adds Carcette herself as an exclusion, so she should never say it.

  
**New:**Added a version for [Extended Encounters](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44810)﻿ which applies both the restoration training fix and the dialogue fix!
  
  
**Compatibility:**This mod makes no direct edits to Keeper Carcette herself, so should be compatible with everything. It does however edit the Immersive World Encounters version of Carcette (she is a clone) by adding her to the JobTrainerFaction and RestorationTrainerFaction. FaceGen *shouldn't* be an issue, but I do generally recommend [Face Discoloration Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42441)﻿ if you're not already using it.
  
  
Safe to install on existing saves, however do note that there is an engine bug where new dialogue options don't always show up on existing saves, this can sometimes be fixed by saving and reloading, it can be a bit inconsistent.
  
  
It *should* also be compatible with [Keeper Carcette Survives SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9476)﻿ by Ruhadre, as that mod also apparently fixes her training bug. I'd recommend loading this patch after that mod. This is untested however so feedback is welcome.
  
  
**Q&A
  
Q.** I don't use IWE, can you make a standalone version for the vanilla fixes?
  
**A.** [Already exists](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/87564)﻿**Q.** What about for the third person bug?
  
**A.** Would be obsolete without IWE, as Carcette never leaves Vigilant HQ
