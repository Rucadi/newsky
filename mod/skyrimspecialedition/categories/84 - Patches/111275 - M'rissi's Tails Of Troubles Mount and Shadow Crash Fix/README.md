Thanks to Anna Garcia for allowing me to use the working sabrecat mount skeleton from the mod [Katana - Journey in the Shadows](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69622/)﻿
  
  
This mod also changes Shadow (The mother sabrecat in the quest Feline Solidarity) to be separate from the mount Lirry, so i could make it use the original Skyrim skeleton, as this mount version was causing crashes when killing Shadow. So this fix stops the crashes, but still enables M'rissi to use Lirry as a mount as intended.
  
  
Tested on 1.5.97 but should work on any version that M'rissi's Tails of Troubles works on
  
Load after M'rissi as this overwrites the skeleton, and place the ESL flagged ESP after the main mod esp
