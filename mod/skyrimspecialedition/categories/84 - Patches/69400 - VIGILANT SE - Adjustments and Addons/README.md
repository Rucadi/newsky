# VIGILANT SE - Adjustments and Addons

[font=Tahoma]**The problem:**[VIGILANT](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11849) ﻿is and will forever remain as one of the greatest mods ever made for Skyrim. Its only and biggest flaw (to me at least), is that its rewards slightly undermine the entire experience, since after having finished this mod, the items you found along the way turn any and every enemy into fodder, no matter how hard your modded setup might be.
  
  
**My solution:**Three plugins, *Rebalanced Rewards*, *No Boss Summons* and *VIGILANT Revised Scripts for MCO*.
  
  
  
**REBALANCED REWARDS**
  
  
This plugin will rebalance the enchantments of most of the equipment (armor and weapons), to make it less or more overpowered when necessary (indeed, some items needed a buff to keep up with other items, like Varla's Shotel). Also, I overreached and went beyond the original scope of the plugin. I tried for the first time my coding skills, adding new weapons arts to some weapons, some of which have (~~really simple, plagiarized~~) brand new scripts.

**[font=Tahoma]NO BOSS SUMMONS[/font]
  
[font=Tahoma]
  
[/font]**[font=Tahoma]This plugin is quite self-explanatory. I just deleted from the game all spells that allowed you to summon the bosses from VIGILANT (TL DR all unique NPCs, except Bourlor and Varnaccus). However, you may still summon common/lesser NPCs, like scamps, the coldharbour flame atronachs, aurorans, or NPCs from Greymarch. I might do something more interesting in the future with Belharza's Army (aka Varla, Morihaus and Pelinal) and the Knights of the Nine.
  
  
  
**VIGILANT REVISED SCRIPTS FOR MCO**
  
Vicn, as the genius they are, has implemented via scripting 'special attacks' for several bosses. These special attacks mostly rely on killmove animations, that the bosses perform at random moments along with some fitting spell to give the illusion of having their own moveset. With MCO, this becomes deprecated. The ONLY solution for this is to EDIT ALL THE SCRIPTS OF THE BOSSES and cut out these special attacks. You cannot just delete these scripts because often, there are several other things going on in them, like music tracks stopping or stability checks (though I have not figured out if these are strictly necessary). So guess what I spent two hours doing...
  
  
I also removed calculations associated to these special attacks that became useless without them (I don't think these really optimize anything, but less phantom calculations are always welcome). If there are any issues, I cannot guarantee I can solve them. I linked these source scripts after I modified them so you can compare them to the originals.
