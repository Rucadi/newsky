**Caught Red Handed - Quest Expansion - OStim Patch**
  
Read the description carefully before using this mod. I have below, in detail, the installation instructions, what this mod does and how it works. This mod patches the original [Caught Red Handed - Quest Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65708) to trigger an OStim scene with Haelga instead of fade to black screens.

**﻿1. Installation instructions**
  
Use the mod manager of your choice to install this mod. I will not provide support for manual installations.
  
  
**1) Install [b]OStim Standalone** and all its requirements by **carefully** following the [OStim Installation Tutorial](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/5654)﻿.[/b]
  
  
  
**2) Install [b]Caught Red Handed - Quest Expansion**. My patch will not work without the original mod! I merely updated the necessary assets. All of the other assets are present in the original mod and you obviously need them for my patch to work.[/b]
  
  
The USSEP patch from Caught Red Handed - Quest Expansion is **fully compatible** with my mod! The records do not conflict with my patch. You can check it yourself in xEdit :)
  
  
  
**3) Install this mod and let it overwrite Caught Red Handed - Quest Expansion (or in other words, let my patch win all conflicts).**
  
  
**You have two versions available for this patch. The difference between them is simple:**
  
  
**Version 2.2A** - OStim scenes will always occur in Haelga's bedroom. Choose this if you don't want to be teleported anywhere and keep your privacy inside the Bunkhouse! Contains an .esp flagged ESL which won't take a slot in your load order.
  
  
**Version 2.2B** - OStim scenes will trigger in random locations, like in the original Caught Red Handed - Quest Expansion mod. These locations include the Riften stables, the Riften docks, the Riften cemetery, among others. Choose this if you want sexy time with Haelga in spicier places. **Note that her bedroom is also in the random locations pool**, so sometimes you might get an OStim scene in her bedroom even with this version! Only the scripts that trigger the scenes were updated. It does not contain, nor need an additional .esp.
  
  
**It is 100% safe to switch between versions midgame! Nothing will break if you want to change between version 2A and version 2B as you please!**
  
  
  
**The current versions of my patch only work with Caught Red Handed - Quest Expansion 1.04, the latest version! Do not try to use it with earlier versions of the [b][size=3]Caught Red Handed - Quest Expansion mod - scenes might fail to trigger otherwise!**[/size][/b]
  
  
  
**2. How do I actually use this mod ingame?**
  
When Svana asks for your help to shame Haelga for her practices, you can refuse it and say that Haelga is free to do whatever she wants. Afterwards, you'll want to talk with Haelga and mention that word about her practicing the "Dibellan Arts" is spreading. This is visible in the images section. From there, you can convince Haelga to become your "teacher". To convince her, you need a high enough Speech skill or be an agent of Dibella. This is a requirement implemented in the original mod that I will **not** change. Wearing an Amulet of Dibella will also increase the chances of Haelga agreeing in spending some private time with you.
  
  
All in all, if you really want Haelga's services to become available (of course you do, why would you be looking at this mod otherwise?), I'd recommend postponing this quest until your Speech skill is high enough or until you complete the **Heart of Dibella** quest in Markarth (which is the one that gives you the Agent of Dibella status).
  
  
After convincing her, an OStim scene will trigger where you can do whatever you want with Haelga. After that, you can claim a Mark of Dibella from Haelga through dialogue. Then, every 24 in-game hours, you can ask Haelga for another round. This will also trigger OStim scenes obviously. And you will always get the Experienced Lover's Comfort blessing every time you have some private time with Haelga!
  
  
  
  
**3. Frequently Asked Question**
  
**1) Is this safe to install midgame?**
  
  
Yes, **my mod is safe to install midgame if you already have OStim and Caught Red Handed - Quest Expansion installed.** Technically, installing OStim and Caught Red Handed - Quest Expansion midgame shouldn't cause much trouble either, but I won't be responsible if you do that and something breaks. It's up to you.
  
  
  
**2) Your patch changes scripts and adds an ESP plugin, is it safe?**
  
  
Yes, my patch only updates already existing scripts of the original mod. For version 2A, it additionally does harmless changes to the random location records in the ESP of the original Caught Red Handed - Quest Expansion mod. **It does NOT****add nor remove any scripts**. It also does NOT touch any vanilla scripts either.
  
  
To add to all that, all the scripts edited only fire when starting an OStim scene. So this makes installing it midgame ultra safe. Seriously, nothing about it can break.
  
  
  
**3) Is it safe to uninstall your mod midgame after I have installed it?**
  
  
Due to the nature of the mod described above, yes, it should also be safe to uninstall my patch midgame. All that it will happen is that you're going to lose the functionalities implemented by this patch.
  
  
  
**4) Is it safe to update midgame? How to update?**
  
  
Yes, unless specified.
  
  
To update, it's as easy as uninstalling the previous version from your mod manager, and installing the new version. Nothing else is needed!
  
  
  
**5) I have already completed the Caught Red Handed quest, can I still use your patch?**
  
  
The answer is yes, but the availability of Haelga's services will entirely depend if you sided with her during Caught Red Handed, and this is only possible with Caught Red Handed - Quest Expansion mod. If you already completed this quest by siding with Svana or without the original mod installed, you must start a new game to be able to access Haelga's services.
  
  
  
**6) I found a bug or otherwise have suggestions that can improve this patch.**
  
  
If you found a bug, first make sure that you have installed OStim and all animations correctly. Most of the time people will have problems with their OStim installation. This isn't a problem with my patch! Go to the OStim page and [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/RECvhVaRcU) for support on that.
  
  
Otherwise, use the comments section. I will also gladly take in suggestions, but I don't guarantee to implement them. I will do my best to fix bugs, but understand that I have a life of my own and modding is not my job. I might take long to fix bugs or I might take just a few days. It will entirely depend on how busy I am at the moment with my personal life. Please respect that. If the mod is unusable for you for whatever reason, remember that uninstalling it has no risks as described in above questions.
