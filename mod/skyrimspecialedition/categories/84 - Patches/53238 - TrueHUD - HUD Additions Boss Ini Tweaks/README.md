From the description of [True Directional Movement - Modernized Third Person Gameplay](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51614)﻿:
  
  
> ...﻿By default, I've added 'Boss' LocRefType. In vanilla, it's used to mark boss enemies at the end of a dungeon. Mods like Vigilant seem to add
>   
> most (if not all) bosses correctly as the Boss LocRefType so they should be automatically supported. However, Bethesda also have marked NPCs like vendors as bosses of their homes, so a boss bar will appear when you attack them. This might not be desirable, which is why I added a blacklist. I did not fill it up, however, besides adding one merchant as an example.

  
I went through all of the game and DLC's locations and added everyone else who shouldn't be a boss. It sucked, and I don't want to see a Skyrim Location data set again for a very long time. But here you go, now you don't have to fight boss-tier Heimskr if he catches you robbing his house.
  
  
*Should* also work with [TrueHUD - HUD Additions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62775)﻿ going off what descriptions say, but I haven't tested it. 
  
  
A big thank you to Ershin for pointers on separating the ini files!
  
  
Compatibility:
  
It's just an additional .ini that adds to the one in True Directional Movement. Can't really break anything on its own, I think.
  
  
FAQ:
  
Q: I see a boss health bar on a non-boss! What do?
  
A: If you spot a non-boss with a boss healthbar, post it in the comments and I'll add it to the blacklist. There are *alot* of NPCs I had to add, I'm sure I must have missed a couple somewhere. Orc Chiefs, Ulfric, and Tullius are supposed to have them, so don't worry if you see that.
  
  
Q: Why is this enabled for donation points?
  
A: Because I fucking deserve something for the soul-killing 4 hours it took to make this by hand.
