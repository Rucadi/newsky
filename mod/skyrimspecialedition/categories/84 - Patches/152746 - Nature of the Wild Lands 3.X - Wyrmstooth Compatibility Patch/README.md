**Instructions:**For this patch to work properly you need to download; [Nature of the Wild Lands](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63604), without it, you'll get floating trees and objects — which this patch is meant to fix! It contains no assets or custom models, only an ESL-flagged .esp that repositions flora and trees for visual consistency.
  
  
You should to run [DynDOLOD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32382) If you're using Nature of the Wild Lands, follow the instructions provided on its mod page for generating LOD with NotWL. You can also find guides on how to use DynDOLOD here: <https://dyndolod.info/Installation-Instructions> & [DynDOLOD for the masses](https://dionysist.substack.com/p/how-to-use-dyndolod-texgen-and-xlodgen)
  
  
**Description:**
  
Instead of simply disabling floating objects, I have painstakingly moved and adjusted trees and flora to make Nature of the Wildlands and Wyrmstooth visually consistent. There may still be a few things I’ve missed, Wyrmstooth is huge so if you discover any issues, a bug report including the cell ID and screenshots of the visual inconsistency would be greatly appreciated.
