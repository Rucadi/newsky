The old Requiem - Unique Uniques patch wasn't perfect with 4.01 on SSE, it would have un-done some changes 4.0/4.01 made to some artifacts.
  
  
The ones I saw were:
  
\* Aegisbane should have the REQ\_Iron\_Warhammer "Iron Warhammer" [WEAP:00013981] keyword
  
\* The object bounds for Red Eagle's Fury and Bane were changed (no idea what they do though)
  
\* Kahvozein's Fang needs the WeapMaterialDwarven [KYWD:0001E71A] keyword
  
  
So I re-made it completely from scratch. Not hard though, anyone with xEdit can do it in a few minutes.
  
  
NOTE: Like the original patch, this patch assumes you want all of Unique Unique's changes, rather than some of the unique models Requiem added. I could alternatively make a patch that uses Requiem models where possible, I think? More research required.
  
  
So here you go! The order of Requiem and Unique Uniques file shouldn't matter - the only conflict of loose files is with Dragonbane, and in my testing it looked the same in first/third and in inventory regardless.
  
  
**IF YOU ARE A 3Tweaks USER** I've added additional patches in the main files. Use only one. Some additional 3T patches exist here: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44044/
