**Better Halo's Poser Support For Photo Mode**

**! Requires Halo's Poser Port for SSE found [Here](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5051-halo-poser-se/)﻿ on Lovers Lab !
  
This Mod doesn't contain ANY animation files, it's only to be used with both Halo's Poser and Photo Mode.**
  
  
A collection of esp's referencing Halo's Poses so they are better sorted and labeled when using powerofthree's Photo Mode mod.
  
Photo Mode pulls it's list of animations from esp and then the EditorIDs of the animations, however for a mod like
  
Halo's Poser there's around 4000 poses all with duplicate Editor IDs making finding the animation you want really tough
  
  
This duplicates the Idle Animations and gives them better editor IDs, in the form of "HalosPoser\_[Animation Name]", While
  
it's not prefect it's certainly a lot easier to use. There's 2 options for the mod, Merged and Split.
  
  
**Merged:** has all the Idle Animation entries in one esp with better names. However there's still 4000~ animations
  
which makes navigation hard
  
  
**Split:** Idle Animation entries are Split into multiple light esp's and grouped together based on set name similarly.
  
roughly around 400 - 100 animations per esp.
  
  
Both Versions can be used together or separately and the original Halo's Poser esp can be disabled too.
  
Note: it seems not all animations where ported in the SSE port but there esp entries were made. This mod also
  
contains those references but the animations won't play until they're ported and added to the data folder.
