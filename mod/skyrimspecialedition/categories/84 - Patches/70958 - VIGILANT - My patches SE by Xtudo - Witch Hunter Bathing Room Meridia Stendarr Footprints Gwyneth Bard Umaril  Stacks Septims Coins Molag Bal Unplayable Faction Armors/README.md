VIGILANT
  
My addons and patches
  
By Xtudo**

**Description**
  
**Several addons, patches, fixes for this awesome mod and more to come!**All files are ESL.
  
  
The files are for [VIGILANT SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11849) v1.8.0. 
  
**I made it for my game and now I'm sharing it, I hope you like it! :)**
  
  
**And here they are:****PATCH - Molag Bal Armor replacer - Mihail's Stonefire Set**
  
Requires[Stonefire Set- Mihail Armors and Clothes (SE-AE version)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/101849)﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ installed first, but only its meshes and textures. And my [Stonefire Set - My optimized textures SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/101861) is recommended too.
  
  
**PATCH - Unplayable Faction Armors (Updated for VIGILANT v1.8.0)**
  
A complete overhaul of the Vigilant of Stendarr NPCs outfits and weapons. Requires **[Unplayable Faction Armors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30051) Default Main File** or **Standalone Version** installed first. But only Meshes and Textures, their plugin is not required. Check out the **Original Outfit addon**, if you miss the original clothing.
  
  
**ADDON - Original Outfit**
  
It will add the original outfit to your personal chest in the Temple. Ideal to use together with the **Unplayable Faction Armors patch** (if you miss the original outfit). It's called **Unarmored** version.
  
  
**ADDON - Witch Hunter - My version - Added the Witch Hunter Social Outfit**
  

  
* A new set of standalone clothes, the**Witch Hunter Social Outfit**, including new five items. You can craft them the same way as the original Witch Hunter armor.
Female only. Males will wear the default armor, clothing version.
  
* HD darker version of this Witch Armor.
2K-4K versions included.
  
* Full support to beast races.
Fixed the alpha channel of the original Witch Armors, now they bottom cape will look worn, as intended.
  
* Survival "warm" keyword included.
It requires the worn/damaged version of [Ashes - VIGILANT Witch Hunter Armor Retexture](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28871)﻿﻿ by Kiriavark installed first (recommended mod!).
  

  
**~~ADDON - Coldharbour music replacer~~**
  
~~It will change the music from all the Coldharbour area, even interiors. A much more atmospheric experience now.~~
  
**With VIGILANT v1.8.0 it's not required anymore, archived.**
  
  
**ADDON - Bathing Room (Install it before Lux if you have it installed)**
  
Adds a Bathing Room to the Temple. Use the trapdoor on the floor to gain access to it. Ideal for roleplay with mods like Dirt and Blood.
  
**Install it BEFORE the Temple of Stendarr music replace.**
  
  
**ADDON - Molag Bal statue replacer (Install it before Lux if you have it installed)**
  
It requires the awesome [Daedric Shrines - Molag Bal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69667) by Mandragorasprouts installed first (recommended mod!).
  
Fully compatible with[Daedric Shrines - All in One](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78772) and [my patches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78809) for it.
  
  
**ADDON - Stendarr statue replacer****(Install it before Lux if you have it installed)**
  
It will replace the vanilla statue with an standalone one. I changed the hands positions, the hood, his face expression and other several tweaks. I also changed the horn to a semi-black marble texture. 2K-4K included.
  
  
**ADDON - Temple of Stendarr music replacer (Install it AFTER Lux - Vigilant patch if you have it installed)**
  
It will change the music from the Temple and Stuhn Ravine, the Sovngarde's vanilla tavern music, to 3 new random ones. The new musics are from The Wicher 3:  Ard Skellig Village, The Fields of Ard Skellig and Wild Hunt - Kaer Morhen, they fit very well.
  
**Install it AFTER the Stendarr Stature Replacer and Bathing Room patches.**
  
  
**FIX - Hearth of Order fix**
  
It uses one vanilla texture, if such texture is replaced by another mod (mostly HD mods do this), it will break the item.
  
So I gave it a custom unique texture, and it's fixed now.
  
  
**FIX - M'que robes fix (Temple's cart-driver)**
  
Fixes the immersion breaker ugly clipping. Maybe you'll need to use "resetinventory" on him.
  
  
~~**FIX - Giant creatures fix**
  
Sets the Giant creatures race back to default values, to avoid stuck creatures, stutter or even CTD. 
  
To use together with mods that change the vanilla Giant Race, like "Height Adjusted Races with True Giants", or anything similar.~~
  
**With VIGILANT v1.8.0 it's not required anymore, archived.**
  
  
**FIX - Elite Vigilant Hood fix**
  
It will fix the chin clipping out the hood, when the person is talking. Very noticeable with Altano for example.
  
  
**FIX - LOD fix**
  
Fixes the stuck LOD in small areas. I didn't fully tested it, if you found a problem (like missing long distance LODs), please let me know.
  
**Only use it if you are experiencing the problem. As the LOD will be missing in Coldharbour (secondary effect).**
  
  
**PATCH - Footprints mod**Changes the Coldharbour's footprints from snow to ash or sand. It's not perfect but much better. It gives the feeling that the Coldharbour's sand is like rotten on its core.
  
**Ash** and **Sand** versions available. They require [Footprints﻿](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3808) installed first, and [Footprints - Alternative Design](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/109544) for the Sand version.
  
  
**PATCH -****Daedric Shrines - Meridia (Install it before Lux if you have it installed)**
  
Adjusts the Statue of Meridia to the new lovely model. Which is used three times by the Vigilant mod. ESL.
  
  
**PATCH - Hi-poly Sand Runner Eggs**
  
The tittle says it all, and it will also avoid conflicts with other HD mods (chaurus eggs replacers), as now it uses its own custom optimized textures.
  
  
**PATCH - Gwyneth replacer (Updated for VIGILANT v1.8.0)**
  
A super lovely replacer for Gwyneth. 2K-4K versions included in the same download.
  
Based on most cute [Elvyra follower mod﻿](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41021)created by my dear friend [GLAMbazoonga](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/83662418) (thanks you very much).
  
  
**PATCH - Bard's Dagger replacer**
  
It will replace the dagger with a lovely HD AAA model.
  
It requires[JS Unique Utopia - Daggers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65394)﻿installed first.
  
  
**PATCH - HD Stendarr banner**
  
Double the quality, and half the holes haha.
  
  
**PATCH - Immersive text edit (Updated for VIGILANT v1.8.0)**
  
It will remove immersion breaking texts like "This scene can be skipped".
  
Changed "Storage Chest (Player)" to "My Storage Chest", and "Knapsack (Player)" to "My Knapsack".
  
  
**PATCH - Umaril armor - My version**
  
A true dark golden version of this armor set. 2K-4K included.
  
It requires[HD Vigilant Project - Umaril](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55654) by Vindition installed first (recommended mod!).
  
  
**PATCH - VIGILANT -****Stacks of Septims - 3D Coin Piles -  Patch. [Here.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/113152)**
