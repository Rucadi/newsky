A few things to note this makes the basic functionality work but on a meta level both of these mods are pretty big and in-depth so you might see some "interesting" behavior if you push it. example: alteration hold to charge perk combined with arcanum's demon blade. what would that do? I don't know because I have yet to test it. If you run into such side effects or something is not working please report it in the forums above, i'll help if i have time, maybe.
