Mod Description
  
  
**In-Game Patche**r is an SKSE plugin that lets you modify Skyrim objects during gameplay.
  
Enter Patching mode by opening the console and accepting prompt or directly from MCP menu.
  
Exit the same way.
  
Select object you want to patch by simply looking at it or select it in the console.
  
(Console selected objects always have priority over looking at objects).
  
You can patch via MCP menu (F1 to open by default - configurable, more details on SKSE menu framework modpage)
  
  
**Move, rotate, scale, or remove** objects and markers (idle markers, spawns, furniture, water flow, etc.)
  
**Add keywords** to base forms. (Via MCP menu)
  
(Items: Weapons, Armors, Ammo, Potion, Scroll, Ingredient, Book, Misc Item, Key, Soul Gem, Activator, Flora, Furniture)
  
  
**Save your edits as BOS/KID** patches so they persist across game sessions.
  
Share your patches with others as lightweight .ini files - no ESP/ESL required!
  
  
Beta feature: **BOS conflict resolver** open in-game menu to see what BOS inputs possibly overlap with each other.
  
Choose witch one to keep and witch one to comment out.
  
  
While primarily designed as a modding tool, it’s also beginner-friendly. Regular players can use it to:
  
Fix floating or clipping objects
  
Clear paths blocked by bad placements
  
Adjust world clutter for immersion
  
Redecorate Homes, Cities and other places to their taste
  
Share their patches with others!
  
  
Features
  
  
Enter Patching Mode via MCP menu or open console to see the prompt.
  
  
Full object editing at runtime: position, rotation, scale, removal (Via Object Manipulation Overhaul)
  
Persistent changes saved to BOS/KID files
  
MCP Menu (like MCM but for SKSE plugins) with QoL options
  
BOS + KID integration for seamless patching
  
No ESP/ESL - plugin only, lightweight, safe to add/remove anytime
