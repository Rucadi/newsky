Wyrmstooth Multiple Weathers Patches
  
[line]
  
**This simply makes the weathers in Wyrmstooth much better with patches for various weathers.**
  
  
This adds the Weather **(Rain & Storms in 1.0+)**, Imagespace and Volumetric Lighting **(2.0+)** of the various weathers to Wyrmstooth.
  
  
*Also, if you would like a patch for another weather mod... just let me know too!*
