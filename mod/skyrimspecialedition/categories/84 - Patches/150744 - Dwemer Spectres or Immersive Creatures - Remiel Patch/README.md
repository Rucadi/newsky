Given the boss' dialogue about a "system" involving "switches," I moved him to the ruin on Solstheim where you raise and lower the water. Additionally, the reactivated automata that Remi is eager to see will no longer be replaced by spectres.
  
  
I made a patch for [Mihail's Dwarven Automatons Pack](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49589) to remove an automaton added in the same spot.
