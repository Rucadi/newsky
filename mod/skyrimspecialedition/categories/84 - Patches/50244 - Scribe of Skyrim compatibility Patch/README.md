This is a **compatibility patch** for -> Scribe Of Skyrim
  
  
with the Mod ->[font=monospace, monospace] Book Covers of Skyrim[/font]
  
  
*Posted courtesy of the mod creator*
  
  
***ENGLISH version of the game SKYSYM SE***
  
For in-game books, you will have:
  
  
The cover of books in BCS format
  
The inside of the book in "Scribe of Skyrim" format
  
  
What exactly does this fix do:
  
- It does not modify the data of the Scribe of Skyrim Mod
  
- It does not contain any script
  
- It can be safely uninstalled for your backup
  
- It integrates the USSEP fixes of Book Covers Skyrim
  
- It removes conflicts (SSEEDIT validated)
  
  
*I don't recommend manual installation, instead use your favorite Mod Manager. I am using Vortex.*
  
Installation of the main patch:
  
  
The file to download is a .ESP Pluggin marked as .ESL
  
It will not take up space in your load order.
  
  
it must be at the bottom of your loading order
  
After "Book cover" and "Scribe fo skyrim"
  
In Vortex it will be blocked in the plugins group "
  
Dynamic patches "Installation of secondary patches (Esp.Esl):
  
  
You will find in the download list three more Pluggins:
  
Compatibility with -> Not So Fast - Main Quest
  
Compatibility with -> Cutting Room Floor - SSE
  
SSE compatibility with ->  Display Spell Tome Level - DSTL
  
  
*Install according to your loading order*
  
Same group in Vortex "Dynamic patches"
  
These 3 plugins must be after the main patch
  
  
The Mods associated with the Patches are declared "Master File" by the Patch
  
If you install a secondary patch that you don't need,
  
your mod manager will let you know.
  
If you start your game anyway, it will not start,
  
due to the absence of the master file.
  
  
I wish you a good game in Skyrim SE
  
  
P.S .:
  
Remember to "approve all Mods" you install in your game, this is the best reward you can give Mod makers.
  
  
---------------------------- **SKYRIM AE** -----------------------------
  
             [*I'am Back in Skyrim updated to 1.6.640*]
  
  
This SSE mod was made for game in version 1.5.97
  
  
Some Mods affected by this patch have evolved from AE, others have disappeared from the Nexus,
  
bringing a lot of complexity to the update of these Patches.
  
  
Maintaining these fixes across all 3 versions of Skyrim SE seems way too much of a hassle for my little brain.
  
This Mod will remain in its original version and I'm sorry about that.
  
  
I leave it on the Nexus for all those who stayed or will stay in the 1.5.97 version of the Game  & Mods
  
  
**Permission** :
  
If any of you would like to take on the challenge of doing the AE patches you are free to do so,
  
I just ask you if you are basing it on my Mod to do a little reminder of the original creator -> Trazibol.
  
That would be very polite of you ;)
  
  
Many thanks to all those who have downloaded and approved this modest work.
  
It was my first Mod ;)
  
  
I wish you good adventures in Skyrim, a superb game,
  
but which lost many Mods following the grotesque version of AE,
  
and it is a pity.
  
  
**Precision** *:*
  
*In my new game in Version 1.6.640 I installed the Mod :* **Legacy of the Dragonborn** 
  
*which already includes Skyrim Book Covers & Scribe of Skyrim Patches*
