# Creature Collision Fix

So I've been using mods or patchers that make weapons have a more realistic range but then ran into this issue: certain enemies like Trolls and Lurkers have huge hitboxes so they cannot be hit from the front by shorter-range weapons.
  
  
This fixes that.
  
  
These are based off XP32 skeleton but doesn't require it to function as far as I can tell. Just make sure this skeleton is winning vs XP32
  
  
If you come across other creatures with the same issue, let me know and I can add it to the mod.
  
  
Currently included creatures:
  
  

  
* Trolls
Lurkers
  
* Falmer
Frostbite Spiders
