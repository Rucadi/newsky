# VIGILANT - Shadowfoot Sanctum Patch

VIGILANT reverts some navmesh changes to the Ratway done by the official Update.esm, due to being based on the Skyrim LE version of Update.esm.
  
  
This just combines VIGILANT's navmesh changes and added doors with the official changes from SE Update.esm for compatibility with the official Shadowfoot Sanctum DLC.
