Adds items from mods to the craftloot, sorting, stash spell and storage system right off the bat. Includes patches for cooked food, firewood, gems, ingots, ingredients, leather, liquors, materials, ores, poisons, potions, raw food, recipes, scrolls, soul gems and treasure.
  
  
The days of manually adding items to [Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802)'s craftloot and storage system are finally gone.
  
  
As of version 2.0, this mod is officially endorsed and supports all mods that are officially recognized by Legacy of the Dragonborn, including approved add-ons that have the Auryen Seal of Approval. Optional patches for unofficial third-party add-ons and mods are still distributed for your convenience, but aren't supported by the team and new patches for them won't be prioritized anymore.

[font=bebas\_neuebook]Installation[/font]
  

  
1. Install [FormList Manipulator - FLM](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74037) and its requirements.
Install the fomod. It auto selects some options for you based on the mods that you have, but feel free to choose.
  
2. Play the game. If it isn't working, you're probably missing a FLM requirement or using the wrong version of one of them.

* Quest items won't be transferred by the Stash Spell. Radiant quest items are an exception, though.
This mod doesn't change how the Legacy of the Dragonborn system works, so you can use the blacklist to exclude categories and items like normal.
