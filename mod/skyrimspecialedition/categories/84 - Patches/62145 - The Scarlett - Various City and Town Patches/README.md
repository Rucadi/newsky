This collection is for everyone who ever took a look at [The Scarlett - A Buildable Ship](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2434) but didn't put it in their load order because it didn't have patches for some of the larger and more expansive city and town mods on the Nexus. I haven't covered *every* mod - I'm not at all sure how many people are interested in using The Scarlett in the first place - but I've done my best to cover the big ones. Pictures of all of the changes made have been provided in the Images tab.
  
  
So without further ado - all hands to navigation stations, and prepare to cast off.
  
  
  
**Mods Covered:** (Besides The Scarlett)
  
  
[The Great City of Dawnstar](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19491) - Deleted a rowboat that was in the way, and moved the Scarlett's rowboat out from under the dock to take its place.
  
  
[The Great City of Morthal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19592) - Moved the Scarlett's rowboat out from the caged-off area and over to its own pier.
  
  
[The Great Town of Ivarstead](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34505) - Scooted the rowboat so it no longer intersects with the bridge.
  
  
[The Great City of Solitude](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22243) - Moved one of the longships down a few planks, and made a new pier so that the Scarlett's ladder wasn't hanging over open water.
  
  
[The Great Cities - Minor Cities and Towns](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20272) - Combines the Morthal and Dawnstar patches so that they point to the correct .esp. Ivarstead and Solitude will still need to be installed modularly.
  
  
(The Dawnstar, Morthal, Ivarstead, and Solitude patches can also be found in the modular bundle if you're using all of the cities.)﻿
  
  
﻿[JK's Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6289) - Moved the Morthal rowboat over in place of one that already existed, moved the Ivarstead rowboat out of the way of the walkway, and moved the debris off the top of the rowboat in Riverwood.
  
  
[JK's Riverwood](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2013) - Same change as the JK's Skyrim version, but for the standalone Riverwood mod.
  
  
﻿[Morthal Overhaul II](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17536) - Moved the rowboat down the pier so it wasn't underneath the shed.
  
  
[Quaint Raven Rock](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20851) - Deleted a rowboat so that the Scarlett's rowboat wasn't stuck in it.
  
  
[Save the Icerunner](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34681) - The Icerunner patch *is* compatible with [Solitude Docks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13922), if you're running that. Huge thanks to Keysmash101 and CommanderAbsol for confirming that the patch does actually work.
  
  
If anyone has a request for a city patch, let me know! I tested all of the other The Great Cities mods, Capital Windhelm Expansion, Ryften Down, and Solitude Docks, and found all of them compatible without having to change anything. I've not looked at Cities of the North because as far as I can tell it's an aesthetic overhaul and doesn't add any more buildings, but I'll gladly give it a second glance if need be.
  
  
  
**Patches by Others:**
  
  
**[JK's Solitude Outskirts](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/146025?tab=description)** - Which I erroneously thought was part of JK's Skyrim, has been patched by KaiserOmega. Many thanks!
  
  
  
**Known Issues and Possible Complaints:**
  
  
- The Great Town of Ivarstead patch is labeled as "GC Ivarstead" instead of "GT Ivarstead," but don't worry, it still points to the right file.
  
  
- Some of the "spawn in" markers for the boats still drop the player in a slightly wonky place. I did supposedly move them to less weird places, but no matter what I did, the old drop-in locations still stayed. Luckily, the player never ends up clipping with anything or underwater, which is a plus!
  
  
- I don't think any of the patches are marked as .esl, simply so that they actually do load *after* the mods they're trying to override.
  
  
- I am running Skyrim SE, so none of these patches have been tested for LE or AE. (If someone does test these on AE and nothing conflicts, let me know! I'll mark it as such.)
  
  
- **DynDolod Error** - I've added an experimental patch to the "Miscellaneous Patches" section to try to fix this. Basically this patch attempts to nullify the weird FormID errors that sometimes trip up DynDolod. I haven't been able to reproduce the initial bug, so I'm not sure if this actually does what it's intended to do, all I know is that it doesn't seem to break anything that already works. **Use at your own risk.** (But also report back if it does work.)
  
  
  
  
**Future/Current Plans:**
  
  
- Look into Better Docks and see if patches are needed.
  
  
- Remember how to make a FOMOD, because the modular nonsense I uploaded could be made easier.
  
  
- .ESL-ify as many patches as possible for said FOMOD.
  
  
- Figure out how to put a new stop in the ship's travel menu. (This is an ongoing struggle and *also* affects my ability to make patches for the Open Cities series, unfortunately.)
