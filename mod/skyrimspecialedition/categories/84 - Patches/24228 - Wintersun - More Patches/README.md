**Book Covers Skyrim Patch:**Resolves some book incompatibilities. If using Legacy of the Dragonborn V5, use their official Wintersun patch instead of this. **This patch isn't needed anymore if you use a bashed patch, as LOOT has given the appropriate bash tags to both Book Covers Skyrim and Wintersun now.**
  
  
**Skyrim Immersive Creatures Special Edition Patch:** Resolves a conflict in the quest 'Discerning the Transmundane', allowing you to harvest Falmer blood during this quest from the new Falmer races that are added by Skyrim Immersive Creatures Special Edition. This file includes a script from SIC, and was uploaded here with lifestorock's blessing.
  
  
Includes all quest description changes from the mod Even Better Quest Objectives SE - EBQO SE. Use version 1.0 in old files if you don't want the EBQO changes.
  
  
**Zim's Immersive Artifacts Patch:** Adds Namira favor for eating corpses with the Zim's Improved Artifacts cannibalism effect.
  
  
All files are ESPFE.
