* ~~[font=Georgia]Changing Outfit record of the dragon Vulthurkrah from [Wyrmstooth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45565)﻿ by Jonx0r to align its model with [Dragons SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/132218)﻿ by 4thUnknown.[/font]~~
~~[font=Georgia]No additional mesh/texture. Referenced "DragonFrostSkinOutfit" from base game as this is the most related one.[/font]~~
  
* ~~[font=Georgia]ESPFE.[/font]~~
[font=Georgia]From v2.0 on, plugin no longer & now includes a new mesh based on 4th's Frost Dragon, with slight edits to reflect Jonx0r's model.[/font]

[/font][font=Georgia]﻿ ﻿? DESCRIPTION
  
[/font][font=Georgia]
  
Since Vulthurkrah has an outfit record specified to it, the dragon preserves its model defined by Wyrmstooth even after you install Dragons SE, with somewhat distorted textures. Looking at the Item records of this Outfit, one will notice that they are based on DragonFrostSkinOutfit, with only difference being skin item. So I edited the mesh for Frost Dragon provided by 4thUnknown's mod to get a resemblance with the original Vulthurkrah.

Nothing to worry about, long as you don't have any other replacer for Vulthurkrah. So...
