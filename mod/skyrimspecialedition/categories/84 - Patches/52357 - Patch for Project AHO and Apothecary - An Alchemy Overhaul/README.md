Project AHO adds new potions and ingredients based on vanilla items. Their names, effects, values, and magnitudes will be inconsistent with Apothecary without a patch. This file changes the potions from Project AHO to have the same names, effects and values as the potions in Apothecary. Because Apothecary edits the vanilla alchemy magic effects, the effects on the ingredients from Project AHO will be changed even without a patch. However, their magnitudes still had to be edited to match the ingredient changes from Apothecary. This patch is up-to-date for version 1.3.3 of Apothecary. It will very likely be OK to use with newer versions, but some inconsistencies may emerge.
