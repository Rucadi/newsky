**Frequently Asked Questions**
  
Spoiler
  
Q: What does this mod do?
  
  
A: It adds every weapon from [Animated Armoury - DAR Version](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35978) to a list that adjusts the sizes of the hit boxes on each weapon so you can hit most enemies in both 1st and 3rd person mode when [Precision](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72347) is installed. Each weapon was successfully tested on both skeevers and bandits, so you should be able to hit pretty much anything as long as you have decent aim.

Q: Is this mod compatible with "insert tweaked version of Animated Armoury"?
  
  
A: If the name of the esp and weapon ID's haven't been changed in the mod in question, the answer is probably yes. You'll need to test it out to know for sure though.

Q: Do I need to run Nemesis/Pandora after installing this mod?
  
  
A: No. This mod doesn't change behavior files, so running a tool that changes behaviors isn't needed.
