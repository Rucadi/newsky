**Fixes an animation issue when equipping Katana with Shields and Staffs when using [Animated Armory](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35978).
  
  
*This mod doesn't change the animations themselves but enables the 1H Katana animations when wearing a shield or a staff with a Katana. (as seen in the screenshot)***
  
Compatible with all mods if they don't change the same animation conditions.
