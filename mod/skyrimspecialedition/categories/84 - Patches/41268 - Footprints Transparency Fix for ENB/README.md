# Footprints Transparency Fix for ENB
- Author: Korodic and Daralima
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

**Update: hexabit now offers an official fix available as an optional file on the Footprints mod page. I will release an update to mimic hexabit's fix, but that is the final update of this mod (removal of BSA file). I strongly recommend downloading the fix from the author of the original mod whenever possible. Get it [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3808).**
  
  
Are you a user of the Footprints mod by hexabit? Ever see a footprint on the ground and a border around the footprint like someone just copied and pasted a photo on the ground? This mod should fix that and is ESP flagged as ESL; it should not count against the plugin limit.
  
  
~~This does seem to have some drawbacks in displaying the stretched footprints - which seemed dependent on the player's camera angle, NPCs do not have any issues "recording" their footprints. I'd rather have this than squares.~~ No drawbacks as of v2.0

This is a mod I made to remove the boxes around the spell impact retextures added by the Deadly Spells Impact mod created by isoku.

There now exists an optional file to fix the boxed and slightly transparent blood splatters. The optional file includes a new .esp file, you need to overwrite the old one. I did not see a “LITE” version last time I checked, make sure you are replacing your .esp with an equivalent or you may run into issues.
