I made this patch hub to avoid cluttering the requirements tab of the main ORomance Plus page, confusing and overwhelming new users.
  
  
Required:
  
ORomance Plus properly installed and working
  
  
PROVIDED PATCHES:
  
  
**NPCs Wear Amulets of Mara Plus:**
  
ORomance Plus will now allow the marriage option to show up in the Relationships UI if a NPC is wearing an amulet of mara.  The cancel engagement feature of this mod was disabled in favor of ORomance Plus's, where you can also cancel the wedding.  I prefer ORomance Plus's version since it actually makes the NPC mad at you, as opposed to "NPCs Wear Amulets of Mara Plus"
  
  
**Immersive Rejections:**
  
This is a great patch that I heavily recommend. It adds all the rejection lines from Jay's mod into the ORomance Plus system.  You will have about a 65% chance of hearing their rejection lines whenever a ORomance interaction fails (the "X" icon shows up in the UI on a failure). The other 35% you will hear the default vanilla lines of "nah"
  
  
**Maven Elenwen Ingun:**
  
Supports Maven and Elenwen unique voice lines from this mod into the ORomance Plus multi marriage system. You will hear their lines in the OR+ wedding scenes e if they are your non-vanilla spouse as well as their marriage proposal dialogue
  
  
**Hearthfire Multiple Adoptions:**
  
Supports moving your additional spouses from the Multiple Marriage system into the "blessed" homes from HMA, aka Custom homes.
  
  
**Relationship Dialogue Overhaul Lite:**Supports the vanilla voicetypes that were not in the base game marriage questline (Khajit) for ORomance Plus's multiple marriage system.  This might still work with [Relationship Dialogue Overhaul - Update and MCM at Skyrim Special Edition Nexus - Mods and Community](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44601)
  
  
**AI Overhaul:**patches the additional spouses' AI behavior from the multiple marriage system to be compatible with the changes introduced by the AI Overhaul mod.
  
  
**OVirginity Reflowered:**Supports ORomance Plus to use Ovirginity Reflowered's system for determining virginity of NPCs.
  
  
**Nether's Vex:**Patches Nether's Vex to use some of the new voicelines from that mod in ORomance Plus' new multi-marriage system, as well as some other compatibility patching.  This also re-uses some voicelines from "Vex Revoiced", with permission from the mod author.
  
  
**Spouses Wear Wedding Dresses:**
  
This supports ORomance Plus's multiple marriage system, so you can buy/rent/use a custom wedding dress for every wedding. 
  
  
**Serana Dialog Addon:**Allows SDA Serana marriage even if already married, compatibility changes so the SDA marriage blockers to vanilla marriage dialogue don't interfere with the ORomance multi-marriage system, block old Laura Bailey voiced dialogue from playing.
  
  
  
***These are all ESL-flagged.***
  
  
  
I will add more patches in the future, or if users want to make their own feel free to do so and upload them as their own mod pages.
