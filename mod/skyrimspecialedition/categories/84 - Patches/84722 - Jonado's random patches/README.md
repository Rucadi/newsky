I am just adding patches here that I need for my own build, and have not found elsewhere on Nexus. Provided as is. As of version 2.0, the patches have been organised into a FOMOD installer, which should hopefully make life easier both for the users and for me to maintain (the situation with a larger number of loose files was getting unsustainable).
  
  
A few of the patches depend on quite a large number of base mods. I have tried to provide mod groups to assist with the file order where necessary. I will generally not provide modular versions, but feel free to do so yourself. If you know your way around SSEEdit, it should not be difficult to remove mods from these that you do not use. However, you will need to download all dependencies first.
  
  
**Included patches:** *(check the requirement tab to find all dependencies)*

  
* JK's Skyrim - Arthmoor's Dawnstar - Wares of Tamriel (fixes the pier by the ship to take into account changes by both JK and Arthmoor, navmesh resolution)

**Notes about the Beyond Skyrim: Wares of Tamriel - Dawnstar - JK's Skyrim patches:** I started out with making a patch between only these mods, but later decided to also add COTN Dawnstar to my build, requiring another patch. I resolved this by creating an addon to the former mod, but this means that the latter requires both the COTN Dawnstar + JK's Skyrim + Arthmoor's Dawnstar patch at the COTN Dawnstar patch page and the JK's Skyrim + Arthmoor's Dawnstar patch at JK's Skyrim's page. These patches are not designed to be used together, and thus I incorporated some conflict resolution between them in the four-way patch. If not using Beyond Skyrim: Wares of Tamriel, I would therefore recommend you to only get the patch between JK's Skyrim and Arthmoor's Dawnstar that is appropriate for your own build.
  
  
**Notes about the Seasonal Landscapes - Solstheim patches:** These currently only handle landscape edits to make the mods play together without issues. However, some seasonal form swaps would also be required for full integration, making the patches only partially complete for the time being. The reason for not yet including this is that I am planning to create an overhaul of the Solstheim part of Seasonal Landscapes in the relatively near future, and don't want to spend time on something that would likely have to be redone anyway.
  
  
**Notes about ELFX Enhancer patches:** Make sure to get the right version. Some patches are designed to use with ELFX Shadows, others are designed for the regular ELFX Enhancer file. The Immersive Fort Dawnguard patch is dependent on the Sounds of Skyrim version of ELFX Enhancer. I am not going to upload another version for players who don't use Sounds of Skyrim, but you can easily swap the master yourself with WryeBash. The Capital Windhelm - JK's Skyrim patch is compatible both with ELFX Shadows and ELFX Fixes.
  
  
If getting the ELFX Shadows version for JK's Interiors, I recommend you also get the patches at the ELFX Shadows patches hub. I am aware it does not cover all mods, so I created patches for the mods that were missing that needed it and sent them to WiZkiD. I got the impression he is willing to host them at the page, but I cannot help he has not done so yet. The link to them is publically available though, and can be accessed from the discussion thread of the ELFX Shadows patch page. Ignore any warnings from your antivirus software - the link is safe. For the rest of the interiors, use the patches at the JK's Interiors patch hub instead.
  
  
I have also created several Open Cities patches, available here: [Jonado's Open Cities patches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/84729/), [JK's Skyrim - Dawn of Skyrim Open Cities patches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/84822/), [Sky City patch collection (Open Cities included)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85355/), [Open Capital Whiterun patches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85806/), [Open Capital Windhelm patches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85885) and [RedBag's Solitude patches with Open Cities support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86310/).
