I saw that [SoftboiRodvt's](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/2333291) Beyond Skyrim: Bruma x Majestic Mountains [patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33181/)﻿ hadn't been updated for the latest version (v3.2) of Majestic Mountains and wasn't usable in its current state so I've gone ahead and updated it so it's usable.
  
  
Mod requires [Beyond Skyrim: Bruma SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10917) and [Majestic Mountains](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11052/), as it should be obvious.
  
  
Mod is flagged as ESL and has BSAssets.esm, BSHeartland.esm and MajesticMountains.esp as masters so place wherever in your load order.
  
  
Intended Version of Beyond Skyrim: Bruma SE - 1.6
