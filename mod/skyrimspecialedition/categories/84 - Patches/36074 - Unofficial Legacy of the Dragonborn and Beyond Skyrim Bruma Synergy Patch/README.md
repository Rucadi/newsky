**Frequently Asked Questions**
  
  
Q: Will you make an LE version?
  
A: Most likely not, as loading both mods in the CK is only possible through SSE CreationKit Fixes by Nukem, which is not available on LE.
  
  
Q: Why do you recommend a new game for this?
  
A: Yes, unfortunately.
  
  
Q: Is this an official LotD patch?
  
A: No, it is an unofficial patch, since the LotD team won't be making any other patches for Beyond Skyrim themselves. However, icecreamassassin, the author of LotD, agreed to allow this patch to be made and supported unofficially. For this reason, this won't be part of the LotD Patch Central or get support from their team.
  
  
Q: Does this patch edit any scripts from LotD?
  
A: It doesn't make any script edits.
  
  
Q: Is it safe to install/update/uninstall mid-game?
  
A: I would not recommend it. I will be unable to provide any support if you do so.
  
  
Q: LotD/Bruma just updated. Does this patch still work with it?
  
A: I get this question a lot and I'm quite annoyed by them. First off, I'm not a psychic, I don't know instantly whenever an update happens, whether this patch will still work. DO NOT ask me this question, everytime either Bruma or LotD updates. These questions will be considered spam and be deleted.
  
To know this, I'll need to download the update (which sometimes takes a while, with my internet and monthly download caps), and make a delta
  
patch to see which changes were made and compare them with the ones in the patch. This takes time (sometimes several days). In fact, it can be
  
compared to SSE having an update and an SKSE DLL needs updating. I will eventually either update this patch to take into account the new
  
changes, OR inform you that the patch doesn't need an update.
  
  
Q: Why does this mod require [Hall of Forgotten](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64117)?
  
A: It depends on the version you're using. Initially I thought it was a good idea to have this as a requirement, but due to feedback, I decided to also keep a standalone version for people that prefer that one. Do keep in mind that the standalone version will be incompatible with any official patches that take up that spot. (AFAIK More Interesting Loot? May be another mod though.)
  
  
Q: ESPFE?
  
A: Yes.
  
  
Q: Does installing/updating/uninstalling on an existing save work?
  
A: As far as I know, it should. However, it's good practice to keep a backup save prior to doing this, just in case.
  
  
Q: Is this compatible with <insert mod>?
  
A: I don't know by heart. You might need to check yourself.
  
  
Q: Will you make a patch for <insert mod>?
  
A: Only if it's a mod I use myself or plan on using, I have enough time and I actually like the idea. Otherwise, feel free to do it yourself. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: I have a suggestion to improve the mod. Can you do it?
  
A: Maybe, if I have time and I like the idea, I'll consider it.
  
  
Q: Will you port this to <insert platform>?
  
A: No, I myself only support the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If someone else wants to port it, feel free. (see permission) If you decide to port it, you yourself take full responsibility to offer support to said port. I will not provide no support for any ports by third parties.
  
  
Q: I use a ported version of this mod on <insert platform> and I have a problem. Can you help?
  
A: I don't provide any support for third party ports on other platforms than the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If you have issues, you should adress the person that ported it.
  
  
Q: Does this work on Skyrim 1.6+, aka "Anniversary Edition"?
  
A: Yes, it should.
  
  
Q: Why don't your mods use MCMs and instead use this janky console command system to set globals?
  
A: I am not a fan of MCMs. You can set the globals by making a patch in xEdit. I have no plans of changing this. If you want to add an MCM, feel free. (see permissions) This mod however, is an exception to this rule, since it comes with a framework from LotD.
  
  
Q: Why don't you use FOMODs?
  
A: That would require reuploading the entire mod, in question, even if I only make a small change. My internet is limited and reuploading the files each time will take a huge chunk of my monthly volume.
