[font=Trebuchet MS]In mod [DAc0da](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/134405)﻿[/font][font=Trebuchet MS], you was told you were casted waterwalking maigc so you can walking on sea of ghost.
  
  
[/font][font=Trebuchet MS]This is actually achieved by adding collision under the water, but it has minor problems.
  
The collisions was placed below the water surface, causing your movement speed to be slower if you have wade in water installed.
  
And if you have icy mesh remaster installed, you will also find it difficult to move on the icefloes, you will always falling into gaps, and NPCs will also stuck in gaps and unable to move. This is because icy mesh remaster gives icefloes accurate collisions.
  
  
This patch edited two meshes, [/font][font=Trebuchet MS]raised the height of collision floor a little, [/font][font=Trebuchet MS]close to the height of waterwalking. [/font][font=Trebuchet MS]And due to the height increase, the soft incompatibility with Icy Mesh Remaster has been resolved to a certain extent. Now in general, you and these NPCs will not stuck in gaps.
  
  
Disadvantage: Since you're not considered wade in water, you can no longer bath or refill your waterbag at Sea of ​​Ghosts.
