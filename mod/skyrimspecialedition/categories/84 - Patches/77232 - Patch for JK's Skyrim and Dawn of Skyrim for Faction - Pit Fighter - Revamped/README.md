# Patch for JK's Skyrim and Dawn of Skyrim for Faction - Pit Fighter - Revamped
- Author: WyrmStryk

Extremely simple patch that moves some junk out of the way so you can get into the training hall for Faction - Pit Fighter without having to jump over everything. Also allows the guy that tells you about the Pit Fighters in the New Gnisis Corner Club to be able to walk back to the training hall instead of having to teleport there. If anything seems weird or broken let me know and I'll try to fix, though my knowledge is mostly limited in the Creation Kit.
