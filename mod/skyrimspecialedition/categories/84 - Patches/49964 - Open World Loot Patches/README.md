**LOAD ORDER**
  
  
The patches are pretty resilient and generally will work whereever the masters are so long as they're after them (and each other in obvious ways, eg, an OWL- RFM patch after an OWL patch). But if it makes you feel comfier, I've used this load order:
  
  

  
1. *RFM.esm*
*Legacy of the Dragonborn.esm*
  
2. *NewArmoury.esp*
*practical\_pirates.esp*
  
3. *Pirates Wield Cutlasses.esp*
*Practical Pirate Outfit Distributed.esp*
  
4. *Open World Loot.esp*
*RFM - OWL Balance Tweaks.esp*
  
5. **DBM\_OWL.esp**
**DBM\_OWL\_RFM.esp**
  
6. **NewArmoury and OWL Patch.esp**
*Open World Loot - RFM.esp*
  
7. **NewArmoury and OWL - RFM.esp**
*Vilidran Standalone Weapons.esp*
  
8. **NewArmoury and Vilidran Standalone Weapons Patch.esp**
**NewArmoury and Vilidran Standalone Weapons and OWL - RFM Patch.esp**
  
9. *Believable Weapons Standalone.esp*
**Believable Weapons Standalone and NewArmoury Patch.esp**
  
10. **Believable Weapons Standalone and OWL - RFM Patch.esp**
**Believable Weapons Standalone and NewAmoury and OWL - RFM Patch.esp**
  
11. **Believable Weapons Standalone and Vilidran Standalone Weapons Patch.esp**
**Believable Weapons Standalone and Vilidran Standalone Weapons and NewArmoury Patch.esp**
  
12. **Believable Weapons Standalone and Vilidran Standalone Weapons and OWL - RFM Patch.esp**
**Believable Weapons Standalone and Vilidran Standalone Weapons and OWL - RFM and NewArmoury Patch.esp**
  
13. **Pirates Wield Cutlasses and OWL Patch.esp**
**Pirates Wield Cutlasses and OWL - RFM Patch.esp**
  
14. **Practical Pirate Outfit Distributed and OWL Patch.esp**
**[b]Practical Pirate Outfit Distributed and OWL - RFM Patch.esp**

**WHAT'S HERE**
  
  
Most of these are extremely straightforward, but Animated Armory requires a bit of a comment:
  
  
The animated armory patches were built off of [Animated Armoury - Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47213) but do not require it. It also does not distribute whips (for compat with the DAR version of Animated Armoury).
  
  
The main editorial decision this patch makes is that it mixes the new weapon types in with the vanilla ones, such that:
  
  

  
* Daggers include Claws.

  
* Swords include Rapiers.

  
* Great Swords include Pikes.

  
* Battle Axes include Halberds.

  
* War Hammers include Quarter Staffs.

  
The other alternative would  have been to introduce new weapon type lists for the new weapon types and then distribute THOSE everywhere, but the result would have been, I think, the same.
  
  
Imperials now get 2H handers distributed to them in addition to one handers if they didn't have a preference (the same as if you're using RFM).
  
  
**VERSIONS PATCHED**
  
  
This doesn't usually matter too much, due to the kinds of changes that get made. But if things ARE weird, this is a good check:
  
  

  
* Open World Loot v1.21
Animated Armoury - DAR version v1.1
  
* Animated Armoury - Fixes v2.2.2
Reforging - To the Masses v2.1
  
* vpulse08's Standalone Weapons v1.1

* vpulse08's Standalone Weapons v1.1
