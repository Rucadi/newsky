**[The Dragonborn's Bestiary](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/123521)﻿**

Simple mod that adds the sun spell icon into the weaknesses of various undead monsters. This addon doesn't require anything besides [The Dragonborn's Bestiary](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/123521) as a requirement, but won't make much sense if you don't have a mod that adds sun spells.
  
  
I have given the sun weakness in the bestiary to monsters based on what [Mysticism](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839)'s sun spells work on. If you use a different mod that introduces sun spells, then it will probably not match up 100% but will be close at least. 
  
  
They are added to both the vanilla and [Resistances and Weaknesses](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45253) sections. 
  
The [Requiem Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/123831?tab=description) includes sun Icons, so this mod is not needed if using that. 
  
  
Let overwrite the main mod's resist files.
