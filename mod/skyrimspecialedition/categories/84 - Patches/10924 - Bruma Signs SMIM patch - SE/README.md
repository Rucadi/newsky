# Bruma Signs SMIM patch - SE

**---Description---**   
Simple Patch to fix Snowstone Rest Sign and I also SMIMmed all other Bruma signs
  
   
the meshes are replacers
  
   
the esp is really only needed to fix the way Snowstone Rest Texture Set is applied to the mesh....I cant exactly get rid of the esp because its using a vanilla mesh with the texture applied thru a Texture Set...hence the previous sign issue with it applying to the wrong piece of the mesh...so esp is the only way atm
  
   
<<<<<Wrye Bash can merge the esp into the Bashed Patch by default ...so to save esp slots I totally recommend doing so>>>>>>
