**aljos VIGILANT Tweaks**

  
A collection of tweaks and patches made for Vicn's VIGILANT mod.
  
  
Last updated for [VIGILANT 1.7.2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11849)
  
  
**Patches and Tweaks**

  
* **Vigilant - Armor Rebalance**: Adjusts the stats of (almost) every (non-enchanted) piece of armor in Vigilant, over 400 records and 60 Sets. To read specifics, check the articles section. Note: This includes editing some Armors that bosses wear.
**Vigilant - Fleshblade Sound Tweak**: Replaces the attack sound on the Fleshblade with that of Miraak's Sword, while perhaps not as fitting, your ears will thank you.
  
* **Vigilant - No Weapon Arts**: This file is meant primarily as a modder's resource, it just includes every weapon with the Weapon Art Script removed. I suppose it might also be useful for those who just want to get rid of the Weapon Arts in their own game. Does not affect bosses.
**Vigilant - Pilgrim Patch**: Replaces the Shrine of Meridia in Vigilant with the appropriate [Pilgrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54099)﻿ buff. Consistency tweaks for other Blessings and Shrines.
  
* **Vigilant - Player Storage**: Removes the "(Player)" text from certain safe storage containers and removes some unnecessary level lists from one of the safe player storage containers.
**Vigilant - Scene Text Removal**: Removes the Message notifications for certain scenes in Vigilant that are skippable.
  
* **Vigilant - Wasteland Tree**: Adjusts the position of a tree from Act 4 that Molag Bal sometimes idles inside of (at least in my own game). This tweak is likely not needed, but can be considered a fix for some.
**Vigilant - Wintersun Patch**: Replaces the Shrine of Meridia in Vigilant with the appropriate [Wintersun](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506) buff.
