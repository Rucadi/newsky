NFF is my favorite follower framework, but some of the best custom followers for this game use their own AI system that break when improted into NFF! Luckily, Netherworks was kind enough to add a token that, when put in a companion's inventory, removes the option to import them into NFF. Then, another very smart modder came up with the idea of distributing those tokens via SPID!
  
[SPID - NFF - Add Ignore Token to CustomAI Followers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/82945) is a great mod! For those who don't know, it'll automatically put those tokens in a list of custom companions. But the issue is you can still remove those tokens from their inventory! They're just a normal item. Plus, seeing them in there totally wrecks my Immersion(TM).
  
  
Therefore, I made this patch! Since tokens are now distributed by SPID, we don't really need to craft them, right? I disabled the crafting recipe and marked the tokens as unplayable in xEdit, so they won't appear in the inventory of anyone with them equipped. Wowie! How awesome! Now you get all the Immersion(TM) of an inventory only showing your follower's items AND won't risk accidentally splitting Inigo's brain in half!
  
  
I also included an optional mod to disable the crafting recipes for the invisible helmet, Nether's Candelight, and Serana's hood that NFF includes. This is just personal preference; I don't use these, so eh, why not just hide them?
  
  
*EDIT: Updated as of March 19th 2024 to add some custom SPID distribution for follower mods not included in the original SPID - NFF - Add Ignore Token mod: namely, [A Dog's Life](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/94642), [A Cat's Life](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37250), [A Bunny's Life](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106460), and* [*Shirley - A Skyrim Follower*](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45956)﻿*. I've seen some people say importing these followers are okay, but I tested it and it did not play nice in my experience.*
  
  
Q&A
  
  
**[b]Q: I use a follower that uses custom AI, but that isn't supported by the SPID add-on! How can I give them a token now!?**
  
  
[/b]A: SPID is luckily as simple as editing a .txt document. You should check out the pinned posts on the SPID add-on's page for how, but it's rather simple. The author of that add-on takes requests, but I'm also not opposed to doing it myself if you ask nicely ?
  
**Q: The SPID add-on updated! Does this mod need an update too?**
  
A: No! This mod has zero actual requirement on the SPID add-on, it just is kinda pointless without it. But no update to the SPID add-on should ever break things.
  
  
**Q: NFF updated! Does this mod need an update too?**
  
A: Proooobably not. It's possible, but only if it's a major update. If this mod does break, someone else is welcome to update it.
  
  
**Q: One of the follower mods you distributed to updated! Does this mod need an update too?**
  
A: Maybe! If new cats/dogs/bunnies were added to any of the "A [Animal]'s Life" mods, they won't be automatically ignored. Leave a comment and I'll include them.
