[font=Arial]I love Royal Armory. I love the concept, I love the models, but you know what I don't love? Unique items on essential npcs with gold values so high I need to save scum after overdosing on pickpocket potions and enchantments. (Hyperbole)
  
Also items becoming unavailable simply by leveling up. (Lookin' at you Dawnguard)
  
  
So I made a mod that fixes that.
  
  
How does it work?
  
I essentially cut the gold values and enchantment costs and charges in half on weapons\* that you don't obtain as a matter of course in a questline or what have you. Now you have some chance of pickpocketing them without any enhancements at max skill and perks. Good luck!
  
  
\*Don't worry. You still get roughly the same number of hits out of it but you need to recharge it more often.
  
  
Placed Pendulum in the destroyed Hall of the Vigilants. If you're using a mod that keeps Carcette alive: open this mod in xedit and delete the Worldspace category.
  
  
Took Shalidor's Dagger off of Savos Aren and placed in it the dagger display case in the Archmage's Quarters. Master locked and opens with the Arch-Mage's Quarters Key.
  
For ICoW: It's in one of the sliding stone wall alcoves [/font]in the Archmage's Quarters. Locked same as above.[font=Arial]
  
  
Fixes
  
Silvertongue no longer has infinite charge.
  
Adjusted the loading screens so that (hopefully) you can see the weapons now. It's really tricky and time-consuming to test these. Please let me know if any of them are still messed up at all. Try to get a screenshot if you can.
  
The Tempering recipe for Cicero's weapon no longer needs the key to the Harbinger's Axe display case. Nor any kind of vegetable. Just dragon bits.
  
  
Update 6/8/19
  
Added Kodlak's display case key to Jorrvaskr Living Quarters. Initially disabled. Will enable at appropriate time in questline. It's on the table with the map.
  
Those not doing the questline can still pickpocket key.
  
  
Update 7/23/19
  
Fixed the loading screens.
  
  
Update 7/25/19
  
Fixed Harbinger's Axe respawn.
  
  
Update 3/28/20
  
Fixed spelling, grammar, etc.
  
Civil War instances of Tullius, Ulfric, Galmar, and Rikke should now have their unique weapons. \*\*This was not accomplished with scripts; the records were directly edited. Thus any mods that touch the same records will conflict with this. So check your Civil War mods.\*\*
  
  
  
Two versions are available. One for use with [Immersive College of Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17004) by Grantyboy050. The other for everyone else. [Compatible with Obscure's College of Winterhold as tested by Holerhum]
  
  
If anyone wants to backport this to LE, feel free. Just give me a heads up and credit where it is due.
