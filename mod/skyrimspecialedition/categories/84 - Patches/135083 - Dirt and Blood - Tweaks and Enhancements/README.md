**This mod makes several tweaks to Dirt and Blood to streamline the mod and ensure it doesn't impact economy and gameplay too much.****Full Changelog:**
  
- Removed the following debuffs from the magic effect menu: Bloodstains, Large Bloodstains, Slightly Dirty, Somewhat Dirty (they had no gameplay relevant effect)
  
- Removed the buying and selling price modifications, postitive and negative, from all effects (this was added on top of changes to speech which caused it to have a big impact on the economy)
  
- Dialogue responses now have a 5% chance instead of always triggering (you can still toggle the dialogue off completely in the MCM)
  
  
- Rewrote the magic effect entries to be more in-line with existing writing:
  
Before: "You have blood all over you. You are no longer sure if it belongs to you or your enemies, but it certainly helps intimidating those around you."
  
After: You are bloody, slightly decreasing your speech skill.
  
  
- Debuffs rebalanced: 
  
Clean - 3 speech bonus (from +5 speech)
  
Quite Dirty - 10% Weakness to Diseases (from -5% and -5 speech)
  
Covered in Dirt - 20% Weakness to Diseases (from -10% and -10 speech)
  
Quite Bloody - 3 speech penalty (from -5 speech)
  
Covered in Blood - 6 speech penalty (from -10 speech)
  
  
  
**Optional No Soap FX Mod:**(doesn't require main file)
  
- Removes the Soap VFX when washing (intended to be used if soaps are disabled in MCM)
