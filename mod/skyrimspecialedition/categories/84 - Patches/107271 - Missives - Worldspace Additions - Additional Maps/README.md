Just a simple patch to add maps to the missive boards in the Alik'r Desert Basin ([The Gray Cowl of Nocturnal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4509)﻿ or [The Gray Cowl of Nocturnal - 10th Anniversary](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/141327)﻿) and High Rock ([Northpoint](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45870)﻿ and [Beyond Reach](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3008)﻿), the three of which currently do not have one - instead having a big, sad, empty corner.
  
  
  
Uses texture sets to change the maps and doesn't touch any meshes, so other replacers like [Missives - Notes Retexture](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46201) (seen in screenshots) should all be compatible.﻿
