﻿ELFX Enteriors has always aroused mixed feelings, there are those who love it and those who hate it deeply. How many times have you installed it and then removed in disgust? It adds a tons of beautiful details but at the same time ruins other features, from bad to no window lights to glitched shadows under bridges to Windhelm that turns into a dead city. With this plugin you will forget these flaws forever!

[font=Georgia]It also solves many problems with mods that changes bridges around Skyrim.
