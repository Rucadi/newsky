This is an addon to the mod [Suspicious City Guards](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38762)﻿ which makes some improvements for a smoother experience.
  
  
**2 Versions:
  
Normal Version:**
  
*- Guards now ignore if the player has their weapons readied (this caused plenty of weird interactions)
  
- Some other improvements to conditions so the guards only follow the player if it makes sense
  
[size=2]- Being observed by guards will make the player 35% (up from 25%) easier to detect  (which is equivalent to 4 perks in the
  
stealth perk)*
  
  
- Changed the description of the debuff:
  
Before: Due to your suspicious behavior the local guards are actively observing you. Sneaking is more difficult.
  
After: The local guards are watching you closely because of your suspicious behavior, making sneaking more difficult.
  
  
- Reduced the time a guard "observes" the player when they are undetected from 10-20 seconds to 10-15 seconds
  
- Increased the delay a guard starts to observe a player if they are sneaking from 1-2 seconds to 1-4 seconds
  
  
**No Debuff Version:**
  
[i]- Includes all the above changes
  
[size=2]- Removed the player debuff when guards are actively searching for the player
  
  
- Changed the description of the debuff:
  
Before: Due to your suspicious behavior the local guards are actively observing you. Sneaking is more difficult.
  
After: The local guards are watching you closely because of your suspicious behavior.[/size]
