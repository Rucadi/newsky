This mod will adjust various details to better fit the goal of the Immersive collections [1][2][3] made by Canliberk.
  
  
Currently this mod does:
  
- Swap Helgen and Whiterun crystal so Whiterun is closer to the spawn
  
- Add a crystal for Dragonsreach keep, you will spawn near the Jarl's throne (if you want to grab dragon's stone and go directly)
  
- Add a crystal to go at the Leveler's tower
  
- Dragon's stone from Bleak fall barrows is on the table at spawn to skip this dungeon if you want
  
- Note placed on the table about the Dragon's Stone
  
- When going to the Class and curses section, there's a table with a note on this matter.
  
- Moved the "Book of patrons" and "Welcome note" into the building with all the statues.
