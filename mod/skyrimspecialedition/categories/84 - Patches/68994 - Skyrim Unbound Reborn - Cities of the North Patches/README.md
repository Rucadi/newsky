The Cities of the North series of mods supplies unique architecture for the smaller hold capitals of Falkreath, Morthal, Dawnstar, and Winterhold. This includes each of their respective inns. Notably, the interiors of all the affected buildings are placed beside the originals, hidden from view by their interior walls. If you're using Skyrim Unbound Reborn, however, starting the game in one of these inns will still place you inside the hollowed out shell of the original area.
  
  
This set of patches moves Skyrim Unbound's markers for starting the game at these four inns into the proper version of the building. The main file is made for users of all four COTN mods, but patches for using Skyrim Unbound Reborn with each COTN module are also provided.
