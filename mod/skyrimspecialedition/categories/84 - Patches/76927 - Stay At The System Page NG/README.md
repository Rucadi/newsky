"I am aware the game has updated. I don't have a lot of time/energy to work on these things anymore, and I will my mods on my own time. Stop contacting me."

Rather than posting yet another comment on the Stay At The System Page - Updated modpage asking for an update to the new Skyrim version I just did it myself.
  
  
Source code is available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/VersuchDrei/StayAtSystemPageSE/).
  
  
  
I will most likely not add any more updates to this other than maybe bugfixes or support for new Skyrim versions if there are more to come.
