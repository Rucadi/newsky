Intended as a niche mod for those with multiple dialogue and relationship mods—originally meant to help keep track of which "Hey there!" is associated with the mod you wanted to use. Now, if you're not bothered by **dialogue tags**, then these patches will let you know which mod is presenting which dialogue option.
  
  
VDT uses SkyHorizon's [Dynamic String Distributor (DSD)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/107676). VDT functions like a DSD translation, using DSD to dynamically replace text without the risks associated with editing plugins/ESPs.
  
  
  
  
Inspired by TheShiningAbsol's [Immersive Wenches - Player Dialogue Rewritten](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81991?tab=description)﻿, these patches also make *extremely* minor edits to improve readability and to fit a broader range of personality archetypes. These edits are done with *very strict* limitations to not disrupt expected grammatical flow.
  
  
**These fixes have been moved to [Skyrim Autocorrect](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/141632):** Much more freely, also **corrected grammatical errors** for issues such as incorrect punctuation, capitalization, verb-tense agreements, and other inconsistencies. Moreover, in cases where mods were originally created in a non-English language and only later translated into English, also much more freely made edits to better align dialogue with the interpreted intended aesthetic.

[font=Arial]**Installation**[/font]
  
Install like any other mod. Requires [Dynamic String Distributor (DSD)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/107676).
  
Now uses [Skyrim Autocorrect - Dialogue Grammar Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/141632) for text corrections. Optional. Fixes **thousands** of tagged lines (easily check yourself with VDT's included *.txt* files).
  
For [Description Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/105799) support to work, also requires [powerofthree's Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51073).
  
For [Nether's Follower Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55653) tags to appear, VDT must be overwriting/placed below NFF (left pane in MO2).
  
  
**[font=Verdana]✧[/font]** **Otherwise can be placed anywhere in load order.**
  
  
  
[font=Arial]**Compatibility**[/font]
  
Not currently compatible with [Dragonborn Voice Over (DBVO)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/84329). DBVO is incompatible with dialogue that is altered. While this won't cause game-breaking issues, player voice lines may not play as expected—this will only apply to tagged dialogue.
  
  
Compatible with [Dynamic Dialogue Replacer (DDR)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/135618). More information:Spoiler
  
[Dynamic Dialogue Replacer (DDR)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/135618) users: Should be compatible with DDR and DDR-related mods. Note that testing suggests that [DSD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/107676) applies its dialogue changes first, which are then overwritten by DDR changes (such as from [Skyrim Autocorrect - Dialogue Grammar Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/141632)).
  
**[font=Verdana]✧[/font]** **Otherwise compatible with everything.** No performance impact.
  
[font=Tahoma]⧉[/font] **Updates** — *How do updates work?*
  

[font=Tahoma]✧[/font] With [DSD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/107676), older VDT patches are now **always safe** to use. [DSD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/107676) prevents game-breaking issues and other typical consequences, even if mods alter or update underlying dialogue mechanics/scripts. However, newly added lines may appear untagged until VDT updates, leading to minor cosmetic inconsistencies. In some cases, you may also miss updates to the dialogue text itself, such as reworded or revised lines—though only the 'cosmetic' visible string is ever affected. More information:
Spoiler
  
In the **worst-case scenario**, using an outdated VDT patch means that a dialogue line's *text string* may be out of date. In extremely rare cases, a mod author might repurpose a line entirely—changing its entire meaning and function—but I've only seen this no more than half a dozen times having reviewed **tens** of **thousands** of lines across 700+ mods.
  
  
What's **far more common** is simple cosmetic inconsistency: newly added (and therefore untagged) lines may appear alongside older, tagged ones. This can be mildly immersion-breaking but causes no functional issues.
  
  
Additionally, some mod authors may revise grammar or phrasing. Minor fixes (e.g., punctuation, spacing, capitalization) are typically already handled by [Skyrim Autocorrect (SKAU)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/141632), which is **highly** recommended regardless of whether or not you use VDT. Moderate revisions do occur from time to time, but using an outdated patch simply means you may not see the latest textual improvements—nothing more.
