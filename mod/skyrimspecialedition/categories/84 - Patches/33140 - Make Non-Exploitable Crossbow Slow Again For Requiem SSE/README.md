Installation guide:
  
  
**IMPORTANT:** You have to disable the patch for Requiem from NECR and use the one provided here, this way the Rapid Reload Perk will work as intended.
  
**IMPORTANT:** If you don't have any animation or behavior conflicting mod, you can use it without Nemesis
  
  

  
* Install nemesis using MO2 and configure the executable (I only have tested it using MO2).
Install this patch using MO2.
  
* Open nemesis from MO2 interface.
In Nemesis UI, tick this patch.
  
* Press Update Engine.
Press Launch Nemesis.
  

  
* Close Nemesis

  
* Right click on overwrite and select create a mod, name it: "Nemesis Output"

  
* Activate the new Nemesis Output mod.

  
* Activate the esp in the right pane.

  
* Run the Rectificator.

  
  
**How to know if you need to run Nemesis?**Well, this mod modifies these two files:
  
  
**\meshes\actors\character\\_1stperson\behaviors\1hm\_behavior.hkx
  
\meshes\actors\character\behaviors\1hm\_behavior.hkx**
  
  
You only need a patch if another mod also modifies this files, you can check in MO2 if those files are being overwritten by other mods, if they do so, and you don't want to use Nemesis, you have to decide what behavior to keep.

  
  

Credits: The current implementation of the mod is combination of the work of several people, the original author of this patch for LE is the user **robbledon** from Reddit. I was looking for a solution but using FNIS, and all the work, help and information for the FNIS version in LE came from **superseriousguy** and I am very grateful to him, but I had trouble porting it to SSE. Then luckily I found the work from robbledon and it was easier to port his work over SSE. But the mod wasn't perfect, so I got help from **Shiki** (the author of Nemesis) and the new version is a compendium of everything they were kindly enough to taught me.
