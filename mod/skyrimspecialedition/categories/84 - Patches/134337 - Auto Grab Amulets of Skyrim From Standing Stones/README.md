Amulets of Skyrim is cool, and a permanent part of my load order (thanks to Legacy of the Dragonborn, but I digress). Over the years, I've gotten annoyed at how hard they can be to grab, be it from hanging moss being in the way or Better Third Person Selection just choosing not to loot it or whatever else can interfere.
  
  
So I made my own solution.
  
  
When you activate a Standing Stone, the corresponding amulet will be automatically added to your inventory. Also disables the amulets in the world. Also checks against a global variable so you can't activate it a bunch of times and get infinite amulets or anything like that.
  
  
That's it. Pretty simple.
  
  
Two versions included. One for vanilla, one for Ryn's Standing Stones. Choose one.
  
  
No known incompatibilities - just load this after Ryn's and LotD Patches.
  
  
Both versions are ESL-flagged.
