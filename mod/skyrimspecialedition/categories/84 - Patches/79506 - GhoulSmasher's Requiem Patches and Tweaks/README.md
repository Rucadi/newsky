[font=Arial]This is my collection of compatibility patches and tweaks for [/font][font=Arial][Requiem - The Roleplaying Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60888). Most of the patches are for Requiem only, not for overhauls of Requiem, like 3BFTweaks, Noxcrabs Mods, or Requiem for a Knave (unless stated otherwise.) You'll also find some misc tweaks as well, which are usually compatible with other overhauls, unless stated otherwise.[/font]
  
  
LOAD ORDER AND COMPATIBILITY

[font=Arial]As a rule of thumb, I'd recommend loading my patches before other Requiem tweaks like Small Tweaks, Noxcrabs Magic Redone, or other misc tweaks mods, if you plan on using them with them.[/font]

Thank you to all the Requiem discord folks who all help out when we need it. Thanks as well to ProbablyManuel for keeping Requiem alive and kicking.
