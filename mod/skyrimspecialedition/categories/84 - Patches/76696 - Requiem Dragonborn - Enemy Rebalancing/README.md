**Rebalances some enemies modified by the Requiem - Dragonborn patch.
  
  
The Requiem Dragonborn patch is generally very hard and to me, many things always seemed a little overtuned. This mod aims to fix that.***[size=3]- Horkers (from base game) no longer have additional armor/damage (they still have armor penetration)
  
- Removed additional physical damage reduction on Ebony Warrior/Miraak/Haknir (e.g. Miraak had 45% against two-handed weapons)
  
- Reduced health of Miraak by 600, removed 50% spell absorption (he still has 30%)
  
- Reduced some of the resistances of the Ebony Warrior (elemental resistances and bonus armor)
  
- Reduced the amount of "Potion of Restore Health (Surpassing)" on bosses (removed in some cases)
  
- DB Dragonpriests have less armor and replaced spell absorption with magic resistance (to be in line with base Requiem)
  
- Reduced the regeneration of Seekers and Lurkers
  
- Ash spawns have less physical damage resistances and are no longer susceptible to silver arrows
  
- Some other small changes here and there, nothing major
