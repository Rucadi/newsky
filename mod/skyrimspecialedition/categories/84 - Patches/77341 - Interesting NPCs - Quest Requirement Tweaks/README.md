This mod makes small tweaks to dialogue trees/branches and scripts within Interesting NPCs, with the goal of reducing or improving the requirements for certain quests within the mod. More tweaks will be added to this mod with time.
  
  
I made this mod for myself because I miss a lot of the quests in Interesting NPC's due to the restrictions. Most people nowadays play with some form of alternate start mod, so quests requiring Dragon Rising are usually never played. This issue within Interesting NPCs extends beyond just requiring your character to be the Dragonborn, and as such this mod has expanded beyond just that problem.
  
  
It should be noted that by virtue of what this mod does, you may encounter some voice lines from NPCs that either refer to the player character being Dragonborn, or mentioning events that may not have occurred yet. In a few instances, I have changed the response text of these lines to match the situation a bit better, however the original voice line will still play. I decided that being able to play through these quests, which otherwise had no real connection to a removed condition, is worth having a line or two not make sense. This does not mean I will not attempt to make this a lot smoother in the future.
  
  
**TLDR**; This mod removes some conditions from certain Interesting NPCs quests. Due to this, some NPC voice lines won't make sense or will be irrelevant.

**The Changes****The Radiant Dark**
  
- Removed "Dragon Rising" quest requirement.
  
  
You can start this quest by speaking to Corpulus, the Innkeeper, at the Winking Skeever after completing [Forgotten Lore](http://3dnpc.com/wiki/interesting-npcs/quests/full-quests/forgotten-lore/). Previously, the dialogue option would not appear before "Dragon Rising" was completed.
  
  
**Vigilance and Virtue**
  
- Removed "The Way of the Nine" quest requirement.
  
  
You can start this quest by speaking to [Viranya](http://3dnpc.com/wiki/interesting-npcs/locations/the-pale/viranya/) at Stendarr's Beacon after you have spoken to both [Rinori](http://3dnpc.com/wiki/interesting-npcs/locations/eastmarch/rinori/)﻿ and [Among-the-Hist](http://3dnpc.com/wiki/interesting-npcs/locations/the-rift/among-the-hist/)﻿. Previously, this quest would not initiate until you have also completed [The Way of the Nine](http://3dnpc.com/wiki/interesting-npcs/quests/full-quests/the-way-of-the-nine/) quest. Viranya must be at Stendarr's Beacon, and, conversely, the Hall of the Vigilants destroyed to start this quest.
  
**Stolen Property**
  
- Removed "The Forsworn Conspiracy" quest requirement.
  
  
This quest is started in The Warrens of Markarth. After witnessing a beggar commit suicide, you are approached by [Vardath](http://3dnpc.com/wiki/interesting-npcs/locations/quest-npcs/vardath/). Previously, both the beggar and Vardath would not appear at all until you have completed The Forsworn Conspiracy quest.
  
  
- The clothing check in the Stolen Property quest will now recognize relevant clothing from WACCF and Common Clothes and Armors.
  
  
The clothing check uses FormLists instead of direct script properties. The clothing items from WACCF and CCA are added using FormList Manipulator, which allows you to use this mod even if you don't have those mods, or even FormList Manipulator. If you don't use WACCF or CCA, this change has no effect on gameplay, it just makes more sense to use FormLists.

**A Rose without Thorns**
  
  
- Removed requirement to visit Candlehearth Hall after initial meeting with Erevan
  
  
By default, this quest only can be started after speaking to [**Erevan**](https://3dnpc.com/wiki/interesting-npcs/locations/eastmarch/erevan/) at **The Braidwood Inn in Kynesgrove**, and returning after visiting **The Candlehearth Hall in Windhelm**. This location is not relevant to the quest in particular.
  
  
The quest will now begin after speaking to **Erevan**, and returning after visiting **any other location except for Kynsegrove**. You will now naturally enter the next stages of this quest the next time you enter **The Braidwood Inn**.

**REQUIREMENTS****Interesting NPCs:** <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194>Be sure to place this mod **BELOW** Interesting NPCs both in your plugin load order, **AND** your asset load order. This mod contains scripts that need to overwrite Interesting NPCs assets.
