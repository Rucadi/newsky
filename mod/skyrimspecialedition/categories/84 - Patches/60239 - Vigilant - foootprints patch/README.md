There is nothing more to say about this patch. It is simple edit of landscape textures of desert to be recognized as a sand instead of dirt so thanks to [Footprints Sand patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50484)﻿ footrpinsts will appear on those serface. You can incorporate this into marge patch, copy to whatever plugin with Vigilant or just use as is. Plugin is flagged as esl.
