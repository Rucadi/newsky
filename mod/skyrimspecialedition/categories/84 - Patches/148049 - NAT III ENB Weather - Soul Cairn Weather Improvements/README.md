An addon improving weather visuals and consistency in the Soul Cairn for [NAT 3 ENB weather](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27141).
  
This mod is not needed with [NAT.CS III](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/139567) as that mod features similar fixes already.
  
  
  
*- Soul Cairn now only features soul cairn specific weather (in NAT III you were able to get normal weathers without the unique Soul Cairn Skybox)
  
- Reworked the fog effect in Soul Cairn to be smoother
  
- Fixed an issue that could cause mods such as Splashes of Storms display splashes even when it's not raining
