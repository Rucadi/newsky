# KRCE - COTN - Morthal Consistency Patch
- Author: CinamonPizza
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

Another small and simple patch, due to the cell edits COTN: Morthal makes to Falions House, some quest items for Kaidan are left hanging in the void. This moves the two items inside of the house and onto the Enchanting Table, so you don't have to clip out of bounds or cheat in order to obtain them!
  
  
**NOTE:** This patch is intended for use with Kaidan Revoiced - Community Expansion (KRCE), and WILL NOT work with any other version of Kaidan thats out there. If your using Kaidan 2, a patch is already available in the COTN: Morthal FOMOD. Use that patch instead, NOT THIS ONE. **THIS PATCH IS FOR KRCE USERS.**Credits
