**Why this mod exists?**
  
[The Whispering Door - Quest Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76606) (TWDQE) is technically not incompatible with [Wintersun - Faiths of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506). If you load TWDQE after Wintersun, you will still get all of the TWDQE's features, but you will not get a prompt to follow Mephala as a deity.
  
  
This patch takes it one step further. Not only will you get a prompt to follow Mephala in two different scenarios, depending on the path you take in TWDQE, you will also receive Wintersun's favor point rewards and penalties, depending on the choices you make along the quest.
  
  
**What this mod does?**
  
It allows you to become a follower of Mephala at certain points of the quest (both the "good guy" and the "bad guy" scenarios).
  
  
It incorporates Wintersun's favor mechanic into TWDQE. You will receive Wintersun's favor point buffs and debuffs depending on your choices, whether you were already a follower of Mephala before the quest started, or became one along the quest.
  
  
As Mephala is Princess of deceit and betrayal, I made so that she'll appreciate you going a "bad guy" path all along, but she'll really be excited if you switch from "doing the right thing" to betrayal.
  
  
**Installation**
  
  
Load after TWDQE and Wintersun.
  
Made with the latest versions of TWDQE (1.11) and Wintersun (3.2.0).
  
This mod contains scripts, so don't uninstall mid-game.
  
Plays well with my [AFDI - Aetherium Forge Destroys Items - Wintersun Tweak](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/131468) mod.
  
  
**Notes on compatibility**
  
Some users of TWDQE reported in the comment section that they experienced problems with TWDQE, and linked those problems to Wintersun.
  
While I didn't make a study of the (in)compatibility of all the mods with TWDQE, I can assure you that Wintersun was not the issue, if TWDQE was loaded after Wintersun.
  
  
What actually are incompatible are mods that make NPC's essential and/or protected, like [Protect your People](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10297).
  
I had a similar problem on a current playthrough, and even uninstalling PyP in accordance with all the instructions listed on PyP's mod page and cleaning the save didn't help me run TWDQE without a problem. It worked as intended only on a new game (with PyP uninstalled, of course).
  
  
Below, I will describe a solution to a problem that I ran into, so check it out if you run into the same problem. I'll put it in spoiler tags so that you don't spoil anything.
  
Click only if you encounter a problem in the middle of the quest:
  
SpoilerIf you follow the "good" path (tell Jarl about his son talking to Daedra and he gives you the key), if you open the door and there is blood BUT there is no body on the ground - load a previous save, and BEFORE you open the door, type in console 
  

```
﻿setstage DA08 41
```

and only then open the door. The quest will go on as normal with the exception that Fianna will still be alive.
  
**Patches**
  
I added a patch for Protect your People (version 1.4.3) in the Misc. section. Note that it most likely will not work on an existing save and will require a new game.
  
  
Mephala's Curse patches
  
Patches for [Mephala's Curse - Whispering Door Quest Addon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120650) (version 2.5) are in the Optional Files section.
  
Patch for my [Mephala's Curse - Wintersun Add-on](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/132333) is also in the Optional Files.
  
  
If you only have the original [Mephala's Curse](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120650) - install one of the two patches for it (Hardcore or non-Hardcore version).
  
  
If you also have my [Mephala's Curse - Wintersun Add-on](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/132333) - you need to install one of the two patches for the original Mephala's Curse (Hardcore or non-Hardcore version) AND install the patch for my Mephala's Curse - Wintersun Add-on.
