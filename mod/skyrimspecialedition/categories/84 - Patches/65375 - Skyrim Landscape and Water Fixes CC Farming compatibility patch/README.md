[Skyrim Landscape and Water Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26138)﻿ raises the ground around the water well from the **CC-Farming** DLC making Rin's wooden sword inaccessible unless you TCL trough the ground.
  
This patch simply reverts those changes so that the quest can be completed normally.
  
  
Patch is ESL Flagged (ESPFE)
  
  
SLaWF's FOMOD now includes a patch for CC farming, however it doesn't seem to work correctly according to user reports (I'm no longer using SLaWF personally), hence why this is still up.
  
Will also leave it up for Wabbajjack/Nexus collections that still have this patch included.
