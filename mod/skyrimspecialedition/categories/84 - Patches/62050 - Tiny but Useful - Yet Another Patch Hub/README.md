**[font=Trebuchet MS]PREREQUISITE[/font]**
  
  
Some patches are INI/YAML files so [Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60805), [Keyword Item Distributor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55728), [Container Item Distributor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99486), [FormList Manipulator](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74037) and [Sound Record Distributor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77815) are strongly advised.
  
  
**[font=Trebuchet MS]WHAT IS IT?[/font]**
  
  
This is a compilation of ~320 patches for various mods we love, created over the years. Even if they are tiny, they proved useful in our load orders to avoid nasty clipping or floating issues, which are always such a shame in our precious games, or to forward modifications.
  
  
Here they are gathered into an automatized fomod installer for your convenience. Load it in your mod organizer after activating all your mods and let the magic happen! They are all ESPFE (ESP flagged ESL) or INI so they won't take a slot in your load order.
  
  
**Note**: ESPFE files corresponding to BOS patches are left in the archive (while not installed by the fomod) in case you need them.
  
  
*The compilation may grow in the future depending on what mods we're using. Note that there may be duplicates with other patches compilations: we may not have checked them all or others may have been released in the meantime.*
