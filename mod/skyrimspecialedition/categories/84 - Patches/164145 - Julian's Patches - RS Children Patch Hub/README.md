Patches for GTS' rendition of RS Children, and Dac0da by Vicn.
  
  
Not all of the kids are covered by the patch included in gts, and some seemed to be bugged. I aimed to fix that.
  
  
Concerning the Dac0da kids: For the half-falmer girl, I was going for a half-elf nord girl who had a hard life as both a Mythic Era Skyrim resident, and the lore of dac0da. Plus it didn't make sense for an ancient half-elf nord to have modern skyrim garbs. Same to the male kid, the child of radiance. Plus, the male kid was a copy of an existing kid, and had barkeeper clothes, with key and everything. Kinda didn't make sense. Plus, the child copy of an Imperial was redguard race. I tried my best to make him look like Athanassius and make the face distinct from the original template npc (hence the Imperial hair and me having him not be a copy of the original npc anymore, so I could edit his appearance and outfit).
