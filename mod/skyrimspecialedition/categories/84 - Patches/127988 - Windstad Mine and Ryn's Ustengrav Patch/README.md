What I did:
  
  
- Made the mountain added by Ryn's mod smaller and adjusted related collision markers and planes.
  
- Disabled a couple of threes (Note: they are not deleted, just initially disabled so they don't show).
  
- Also disabled a pillar from Ryn's mod clipping into a building.
  
- Slightly moved two fences from Windstad Mine mod.
  
- I did not have to change any navmesh, just make sure of your load order.
