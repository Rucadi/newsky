I searched around but could not find this - so here's an [Easy WheelMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22934) patch which allows you to add Requiem's "Examine" power to the wheel menu.
  
Provided as an ESL-flagged ESP file.
  
Load order does not matter at all.
  
  
If you don't have it already, be sure to grab the [Easy WheelMenu Script Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38496) as well!
  
  
  
**Notes**
  
  
Even though I set it up correctly (as far as I can tell...) the "hide active wheelmenu abilities from spell list" feature from EWM does not appear to work. I don't think this feature has ever actually worked for any addon (even the ones which are bundled with the main wheelmenu mod). A minor annoyance, but not game-breaking.
  
  
  
Also, a big thank you to other EWM addon authors who *actually provided their source code files* (seriously, I don't understand why this isn't a hard requirement by the Nexus when uploading scripts). I could not have done this by looking at the tutorial on the LE WheelMenu page alone!
  
  
I have done the same, so if you want to use this mod as a guide for how to create a (very simple) WheelMenu addon, feel free to do so.
  
  
  
**Frequently Anticipated Questions
  
  
Q**: Can you make an LE version?
  
  
**A**: No, I don't have LE or the CK for it installed at the moment. However, all that would need to be done is remaking the ESP file in Form 43 format. The scripts and translation txt file can be reused as is (I believe), and anyone who wishes to do so is welcome to use them.
  
  
  
**Q**: Can you make other WheelMenu patches?
  
  
**A**: Unless it's for a mod I also use, no.
