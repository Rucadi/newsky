A small patch to change the effects of the food and drink items added by BS Wares of Tamriel to be consistent with those of Gourmet.
  
  
I have used some of the base game items changed by Gourmet to help match the effects of the Wares of Tamriel items, so it should match up nicely. 
  
  
For example:
  
Mooncake gives you the same buffs as apple pie.
  
Fishsticks give the same buffs as crab legs.
  
Julianos Firebelly Wine gives the same buffs as Firebrand wine.
