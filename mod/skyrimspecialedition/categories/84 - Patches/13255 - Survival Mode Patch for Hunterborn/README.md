This is a patch to add warmth keywords and hunger satiation settings to unuroboros' [Hunterborn SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7900/?).  I made the Bone armor warm and the Northern Hunter Gear very warm. I made this patch for myself, and my additional changes may not be to everyone's taste.
  
  
For food, I made the things you forage restore a small amount of hunger, the jerkies and the primitive cooked foods a medium amount, and the soups and stews a large amount.  Also, the warm soups and stews will fortify against the cold. The teas will restore a very small amount of hunger and restore a small amount of warmth, consistent with their description.
  
  
Most raw food added by Hunterborn has the chance of making you sick. The exception to this is raw dragon meat.
  
  
I figured that dragon meat is magical, so every dish made with dragon meat is the same as survival mode's hot soups -- it restores a large amount of hunger, fortifies against the cold, and restores warmth.
  
  
I'm putting two versions up -- one which changes Hunterborn food only, and one which includes some of the vanilla food so it gives the same buffs/restores the same amount of hunger as the Hunterborn equivalent. So vanilla soups and stews will also fortify against cold and the primitive cooking recipes that end up with a vanilla food will also restore a medium amount of hunger.
