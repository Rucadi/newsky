**Introduction**
  
  
This mod tweaks several things in Wyrmstooth, like adding weapon and armor sets for Brimstone and Wyrmstone, adding some landmarks and some other changes.
  
  
**Mod's History**
  
  
This mod has a long history. It started as a mod to adress certain things mentioned in Zaric Zhakaron's review, that's now deleted from YouTube.
  
A while afterwards, the author of Wyrmstooth left the Nexus and removed their mods. I left the tweaks up though.
  
In the meantime, SE got released and Wyrmstooth was on another side. At the time, it wasn't clear whether it was a legitimate version, so I didn't update the tweaks.
  
Then, Wyrmstooth returned to the Nexus, but as I was busy on other projects and the tweaks were terribly out of date and potentially game-breaking, I temporarily hid them.
  
As of now (October 2021), I finally got time to look at the tweaks again and make a proper SE version.
  
  
**Craftable sets**
  
  
**This part of the mod has been implemented and improved by [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74671)﻿.**
  
  
This module adds armor and weapon sets that can be made using the respective materials.
  
  
To make the armors stand out more, I approached them in a similar way as Stalhrim. All Fire-related enchantments you put on Brimstone Armor and Weapons will be 25% stronger, same applies to Shock and Wyrmstone equipment.
  
  
To make the equipment, you'll need the Glass Smithing perk.
  
  
I have removed the specular lighting from the meshes, so the new sets should no longer have a greenish tint.
  
  
In addition, I reimplemented Brimstone and Wyrmstone ore veins into Wyrmstooth, so you can mine the ores again.
  
  
The equipment sets currently use a Glass texture replacer, but if anyone knows a better alternative, let me know. (I'm looking for suggestions of armor/weapon resources to use that are already done, with little to no additional edits required. I can only do some basic UV tweaks in Nifskope, but that's my extend of what I can do with armor/weapon meshes.)
  
  
**Landmarks**
  
  
This tweak adds some small landmarks, most notably upgraded bridges and a lighthouse.
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
  
These tweaks are only compatibility with Wyrmstooth from [this page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45565). It's not compatible with any versions found elsewhere.
  
  
**FAQ**
  
  
Q: What happened to the other tweaks?
  
A: They were either no longer necessary, or no longer compatible. I have no plans on redoing them.
  
  
Q: ESPFE?
  
A: Yes
  
  
Q: Does installing/updating/uninstalling on an existing save work?
  
A: As far as I know, it should. However, it's good practice to keep a backup save prior to doing this, just in case.
  
  
Q: Is this compatible with <insert mod>?
  
A: I don't know by heart. You might need to check yourself.
  
  
Q: Will you make a patch for <insert mod>?
  
A: Only if it's a mod I use myself or plan on using, I have enough time and I actually like the idea. Otherwise, feel free to do it yourself. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: I have a suggestion to improve the mod. Can you do it?
  
A: Maybe, if I have time and I like the idea, I'll consider it.
  
  
Q: Will you port this to <insert platform>?
  
A: No, I myself only support the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If someone else wants to port it, feel free. (see permission) If you decide to port it, you yourself take full responsibility to offer support to said port. I will not provide no support for any ports by third parties.
  
  
Q: I use a ported version of this mod on <insert platform> and I have a problem. Can you help?
  
A: I don't provide any support for third party ports on other platforms than the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If you have issues, you should adress the person that ported it.
  
  
Q: Does this work on Skyrim 1.6+, aka "Anniversary Edition"?
  
A: Yes, it should.
  
  
Q: Why don't your mods use MCMs and instead use this janky console command system to set globals?
  
A: I am not a fan of MCMs. You can set the globals by making a patch in xEdit. I have no plans of changing this. If you want to add an MCM, feel free. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: Why don't you use FOMODs?
  
A: That would require reuploading the entire mod, in question, even if I only make a small change. My internet is limited and reuploading the files each time will take a huge chunk of my monthly volume.
