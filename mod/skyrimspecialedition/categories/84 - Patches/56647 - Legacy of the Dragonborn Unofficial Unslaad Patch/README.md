**Please note this is an Unofficial patch if you need support please ask HERE, and do not pester the the LOTD team if you need help related to this mod leave a comment and I will attempt to help you to the best of my ability.**
  
  
  
  
This patch adds 136 displays for a large number of items added by Unslaad, and important books added by Vigilant (in addition to quest triggered dioramas) to the Dragonborn Gallery.  Located in the Hall of Oddities of the East Exhibits Hall, sharing its space with the official Vigilant display patch.
  
  
  
  
**Info**
  
  
While the majority of the displays are centered around the newly added spiral staircase, as well as a few on the new second floor (which is planned in time to house Glenmoril's display). A few have taken up residence in the cabinets with Vigilant items. Due to this and other reorganizing which was required to add in the staircase some of Vigilant's existing displays have moved. Because of this and general good modding practices, I **do not** recommend adding this patch partway through an existing game, while the moved Vigilant displays may update their positions if no item is currently displayed on them. I can not guarantee they will all function or update their positions correctly.
  
  

**-- 1.3 Update New Content Please Read --**

Note a few displayable new items (Mask of the Hair, Mask of Shor, Spear of the Fox) are mutually exclusive depending on your chosen ending, however versions of them are craftable after the mods ending at the Sacred Snowball crafting station in Castle Unslaad's courtyard.
  
  
  
A number of carefully selected books from Vigilant (which I have reliably been informed by the mods translator Aelarr are important to Vicn's trilogies overall story) have been added upstairs.
  
Along with displayable new books containing important information from message boxes in the mods, which become craftable on the Printing Press in Legacies library, upon completion of the quests they are linked to. 
  
  
  
**-- End Of New Information  --**
  
  
Book covers for the added books are included in the main file
  
  
An optional (but recommended) separate file replaces the duplicated Vanilla Dragon Priest masks with damaged burnt out powerless variants. (For compatibility, balance and lore reasons)

**General Good Modding Practice**
  
  
There is not such thing as a clean save (sorry to break this to you) once you click new game to positions id's scrips ect are baked into your save file. Changing or re-sorting you load order or adding additional plugins will mean information will not be where Skyrim expects it to be when it looks for it, causing all sorts of problems down the line and inevitably will cause your save to fail many hours  earlier.
  
  
In addition if you want to have a stable long lasting play through, I'm afraid your going to have to do conflict resolution on your load order. Running loot, creating a bash patch etc is just the first step in that process not the end goal.
  
  
  
**Updating**
  
You **'should'** have no issues updating this mod when new versions release, If a new game is required I will say. But be Forewarned that depending what updates are needed for any future versions of Unslaad, a new game may be necessary.
