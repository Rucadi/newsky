# Restarter's Random Patches
- Author: The Chronic Restarter
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/144875


**Full index of patches ~~is below~~ very out of date.**
  
**Check the changelog right above this.
  
And the requirements section right above the changelog.
  
And the FOMOD and individual file descriptions.
  
  
I add lots of notes everywhere, but I just have too many patches right now to keep this description up to date.**

  
  
  
[line]
  
  
**What is this page?**
  
  
It's where I dump all the random patches that I either can't deal with making a mod page for, aren't worth their own page, or are very much in testing so I feel like I need to come back and look them over later (or play with them awhile) before granting them Individual Mod status.
  
  
[size=2]I'm trying to organise them as I go - I usually throw them into the FOMOD in batches. Will be uploading whenever I remember to go through and organise my stash. I'm trying to check they're all still valid and actually useful first. I just keep getting distracted with new stuff to patch, or old messy patches to figure out. Or maybe I'll disappear for two years, if I burn out on Skyrim. Who knows. 
  
  
[size=2]Patches range from massive updates to major mods to the teeniest tiniest single edit patch for obscure mods that have no other patches at all. I'm trying to avoid making duplicate patches, if another version exists out there, I either don't know about it and missed out on using it for myself, or it does something slightly different (e.g. mod authors tend to preserve their own mod changes in compatibility patches, rather than mixing and matching changes from other mods). Or in a rare case or two, I just missed it in my load order (I do try not to upload those if I notice them after the fact but I'm not going to delete it after upload either in case people are already using it).
  
  
I am slowly porting some of the bigger mod patches/more cohesive collections to their own pages at some point just to make it easier for people to find what they actually need, but for now, this is the collective dumping ground until patches grow up enough to earn the Non Random designation.
  
  
[/size][/size]Check the 'moved patches' list below if you can't find something you downloaded previously.
  
  
  
  
**Types of Patches**
  
  
**Gameplay patches:**These tweak things to add something new, that I want in my game, and might be fun for you too. These are *most*likely to get their own page at some point.
  
  
**Compatibility patches:** These just combine records that I noticed get overwritten a lot (by each other or by the bashed patches) or copy over stats that aren't automatically applied because that category doesn't exist in one of the mods. Load these after bashed/smashed patches, unless you have a reason not to, or the changes may just get deleted again in the generated patch. These will only get moved elsewhere if I have a themed collection to split off.
  
**Why make so many random little patches?**
  
[size=2]Aside from the whole 'I'm making patches that don't really exist, because I need them', it turns out that individual patches are much more forgiving than a large single patch because each patch cares about the load order of *every single master* it has. So I'm also trying to convert as many (of my own) patches as possible into small individual ones, except for the multi-patches needed when everything overwrites each other anyway. [/size]
  
  
  
**Permissions** 
  
  
are open to patch my patches, obviously, because they are all patches for other people's mods anyway. And I'm likely to randomly just stop checking here for entirely random periods of time. 
  
  
  
[line]
  
  

**Patch Index**
  
  
Generally you want to download the FOMOD + Updates + Optional Files.
  
  
Updates are usually 'updated FOMOD patches (or 'brand new just uploaded' stuff to make it easier to find)'. 
  
Optional files are usually 'random stuff that isn't in the FOMOD yet'.
  
  
**Misc files are just there for people who want a specific patch and don't want to use the FOMOD.**

  

All patches are ESP flagged ESL unless noted otherwise, or I forgot to ESL flag it (in which case it's safe to mark light yourself).
  
  
  
I'm trying to keep this list up to date, if only for my own reference! I have about ~~200~~ ~~400~~  <<#M% OUT OF CHEESE ERROR $@%%# or so patches to sort through...

  
  
  
**Moved Patches**
  
These patches have moved to their own pages. Any patches over there are either the same or newer than the ones here, which I'll be moving to the 'old files' section and removing from FOMODs as they get updated (I won't delete them outright unless they're seriously outdated, because that is annoying if you've already installed it).

[line]

  
* ~~**Book 'Em patches for Hand to Hand** - Adamant Add on (with or without the Trainers and Skills add on). Very much a WIP, probably does nothing right now.~~

  
* **Chaos Dragons SSE (Form 43 fix version) and Chaos Dragon Tweaks:** downsized 1K textures to update vanilla effects on various weapon/attack enchantments

  
* **Stressed out by the law -** A Stress and Fear patch: Adds the Guard faction as a possible stressor and phobia to Stress and Fear. I think. I am still testing this and may not have done the scripting stuff right, which is why it's languishing in the random downloads section.

  
* **Wintersun patches**: Gourmet patch for Z'en's boon to get the boosted effects and a Wintersun compatible version of the 'Namira's Blessing is Green Pact' renaming patch
**Wielding Sun Stuff Does Nothing** - tiny patch to stop Wielding Sun Stuff Hurts Vampires from having any effect in game (as it isn't always safe to just uninstall it)
  

  
  
  
**Some of the Patches now in the Giant FOMOD of Patches (i need to rewrite this whole page, so I'm just leaving these in their own section)**

  
  
* Chaos Dragon Tweaks - Dragons Use Thu'um patch: patches the dragons changed by CDT to use the new shouts and AI effects from DUT.
Stress and fear are not potions - renames all the potions so they don't get auto-animated when you stress up in combat. This patch is useful if you don't want to rely on manually blacklisting things, but will need updating if the original mod changes anything. Also changes the model from a potion to a bucket because it's funny. And for troubleshooting, if your character tries to hit themself in the face with a bucket, it's much easier to notice than an interchangeable potion! (And definitely works. I haven't had a single problem since I made this).
  

  
* [size=2]Skyrim's Got Talent - Children's Toys patch - Patches the flute for Children's Toys AnimObject Swapper and Skyrim's Got Talent.[/size]
Diseased Remastered - A Cat's Life patch to forward changes overwritten by the official patch
  
* [size=2]Just See Better - Passive Night Eye. A constant effect night eye that automatically activates in low light conditions. [/size]
[size=2]Growl - NPCs transform at low health - a little test patch to make followers transform at low health instead of whenever combat happens[/size]
  
* Interior sound patch: interior weather sounds restored and reverb interior sounds patch to combine their changes and additions.
Elsopa potions redone - Missing Vanilla by Xtudo patches for Gourmet and Apothecary to forward the meshes and textures
  
* All the Simple Hunting Overhaul compatibility patches for new creatures (allowing them to be recognised) are now mostly a Formlist Manipulator file instead. This includes Chanterelle, many Mihail creature mods, Otters, Husky Wolf, and a few other random ones.
  
* Aldmeri Dominion Strengthened + USSEP for quests, dialogue conditions, and NPC factions
The Second Great War of Skyrim + USSEP for quests
  
* The Island + USSEP tiny weapon patch
Paralysis Exploit Fixes patches for Odin and VAEReborn
  
* Wolf Faction is Vampire Friendly patches for USMP, Savage Skyrim, SkyTEST, SkyTEST Lite, and Vanilla.
AI Overhaul - Lore Gameplay Tweaks - NPC patches
  
* Lawless - Simple Bandit Children patch
SkyTest Lite - Wolf Faction Patch for Sacrosanct Rebalanced and Tweaked
  

  
  
**Vampire patches** that pair *really well* with [my Disguise patches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/151446)
  
  

  
* **Sun Affects NPC Vampires - Survival Patch** - uses survival keywords an alternative to the hooded robe patches for individual mods in the Clothing, Weapons + Armour FOMOD.
**Sacrosanct Rebalanced and Tweaked - Give Me Shelter** patch
  
* **Sacrosanct Rebalanced and Tweaked - No Sneak Feed On Followers** patch
Sacrosanct Rebalanced and Tweaked (optional, but this forwards its other changes) fix for **Sacrosanct's Vampire Seduction** power to require being out of line of sight of the target
  
  

  

  
  

  
  

**Misc downloads** These are files that have since been moved into a FOMOD. They may or may not be up to date (I don't actively update them, but sometimes the FOMOD version is the same).

  
  
  

**Updates** These are newer versions to replace a FOMOD file.

 *Most are fairly self explanatory, so aren't listed here. Check the changelog or the patch descriptions for those.**The non self explanatory patch(es):*
  
  
**Updated VAER - Thaumaturgy patch.** This update is fairly major as it adds the new standalone VAER effects to all the Thaumaturgy only enchantments *and* overwrites all the other visual effects used by Thaumaturgy so they don't need to be individually patched for every item. This means that if something else overwrites the same item, it will still have at least some VAER effects.
  
  

  
* *much more extensive patch that updates all additional magic effects*
*overwrites the hit and effect data used by Thaumaturgy (includes various vanilla effects)*
  
* *forwards the colour changes and sounds from Thaumaturgy for consistency (this means fire damage will apparently be blue-gray).*
*more compatible. Only changes to Thaumaturgy effects are to add brand new VAER effects with no counterpart*
  
* *may change some other spells that use the same hit and effect shaders.*

a forwarded USMP fixes version.

**Horses:**Patch to add the Less Horse Fall Damage perk without overwriting other data
  
  

  
* Forwards the name changes from [Horse Whistle Key](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72165)﻿ - Named Horses (just the names, so you can use it without this mod if you choose, but I do recommend it as a great lightweight horse mod paired with [To Tame A Horse](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52802)﻿).

  
Patches for:
  
  

  
* Vanilla
Savage Skyrim
  
* SkyTEST
Chanterelle
  
* SkyTEST Lite

  
Horse Movement Settings
  
  

  
* My preferred horse movement settings, to patch after changes made by random horse mods or add as a standalone mod. No required files.
Basically, it's my version of [Horses Simply Turn Better](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57790)﻿ - check that mod out if you don't quite vibe with my settings, the mods are very similar but different in game.
  

  
**Chanterelle creatures**require separate patches. Get them from my Random Chanterelle Patches page.
  
  
**Husky Wolf - Wolves Use Husky Model**
  
  
Record patching to fix overwrites or add consistency with other modded wolves for:
  
  

  
* Savage Skyrim
Immersive Creatures 
  
* SkyTEST
SkyTEST Lite
  

  
**Other stuff:**

  
* **A Dog's Life** - a tiny patch to give dogs SkyTEST or SkyTEST Lite stats
**Immersive Creatures** - a small patch to forward USMP changes
  
* SkyTEST Lite mudcrabs fix

  
**No Fall Damage For Deer**
  
  

  
* SkyTEST Lite patch
Mihail's Reindeer herds (optional SkyTEST or SkyTEST Lite versions)
  

  
  
  
**Levelled Lists: Creature appearances in the world**
  
  
**Seasonal Wildlife Distribution**
  
  
A custom series of patches for Seasonal Wildlife Distributions and SkyTEST (plus an optional non SkyTEST version for Husky Wolves) so you'll see the full range of options and consistent behaviours. These will change gameplay a little. 
  
  
**Changes:**
  
  

  
* All the existing levelled lists now use SkyTEST creatures.

  
* I adjusted the levelled lists to encourage more variation among the species when they didn't do that already (e.g. wolf colours)
You'll also see more females raising their fawns, cubs, kids, calves, and hare kittens in the spring, with pheasant chicks (technically hen chicks, but it was the best I could do on the spot) in summer, and more bull elks roaring around in the autumn.
  

**Optional patches for:**
  
  

  
* Husky Wolves (standalone, no SkyTEST required)
Pheasant Encounters from Nature's Bounty (I've also tweaked this patch to add chicks during summer)
  
* Otters SE

  
**Compatibility:**My patches are *technically* compatible with the older patch from the SWD page, as most of the patched lists do not overlap, but having both would be somewhat redundant. Theirs doesn't touch the original levelled lists, so will be more compatible with other patches. Mine integrates SkyTEST across every single granular seasonal list, and is much more recent - SkyTEST has also been through multiple versions, this patch is for Version 1.65.22. They will be slightly different in game but the choice probably comes down to personal preference and what other patches you need.
  
  
There are existing patches for Pheasant Encounters and Otters SE, but they aren't fully compatible with my patch and would just get overwritten. They also don't combine Seasonal Wildlife Distribution *and* SkyTEST. If you're currently only using one or the other, then the existing patches will work great for that.

* Thaumaturgy

**Shades of Mortality**
  

  
* Patches to make the Calm and Ethereal effects 10, 20, or 30 seconds instead of the default 5 seconds.

  
**Other stuff**
  
  

  
* SkyTEST or SkyTEST Lite - Odin:  patches the summoned familiar.

  
**Race Overhauls**

  
* **Mannaz and Racial Skills & Levelling**:  Patch to play with both race overhauls, to benefit from MANNAZ's unique powers and a few important changes, while preserving Racial Skills' balance adjustments to stats, once a day powers, and new features.
Optional USMP forwarded changes.
  
* Compatibility patches for Apachii Divine Elegance Store for both Racial Skills and Levelling and Mannaz (expands the default race body slots)

  

**Misc**

  
* **Mannaz - Bosmer Harrier perk:** patch to make it ignore the last ridden creature.
  
* **Argonians Wade Faster in Water patch** - patch for Loki's Wade in Water (also works for [Wade Slow NOT Swim Slow](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/145096)). Argonians wade twice as fast and aren't slowed when swimming.

  
  
**Racial Skills and Levelling** - Better Cannibalism
  
  
  
*Warning: Sunhelm seems to be breaking it's own cannibalism activation, so the Sunhelm compatible patches may not work as well as they should.*
  
  
Patches the Bosmer cannibalism perk so everything gets recognised properly in game by a few relevant things, and/or you can actually feed on corpses properly without going through the loot menu popup constantly. Also forwards changes from [Less Annoying Ring of Namira](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/144641)﻿ (which is an alternative you can use for the vanilla cannibalism perk).
  
  

  
1. Doesn't touch the vanilla cannibal perk, so works out of the box alongside anything else that uses that perk (like werewolf stuff).
Quickloot is compatible, as long as you loot the corpse first, it then ignores empty containers (unless you turn that back on for some reason), and will let you feed on the empty corpse. You may need to disable corpse looting in Immersive Interactions or similar mods (or put it in compatibility mode). At the very least, load these patches after those things. Basically, all the usual conflicts for activating a corpse. 
  
2. Sunhelm is compatible out of the box.
Sometimes I can feed on animals, sometimes that causes horrible crashes from animations or Simple Hunting Overhaul panicking at me. Which is kinda obvious and a dumb thing to try, but sometimes I couldn't resist trying anyway. I don't think it's supposed to be allowed anyway, and I think all the patches avoid that issue now, but it was a sporadic enough crash that I can't be sure if I solved it.
  
3. Sunhelm and Savage Cannibalism scripts apply the Namira perks instead of the Green Pact ones, but they currently have identical effects under different names so it's a minor annoyance. If this annoys you, there are optional patches in the FOMOD to rename the effect back to 'Green Pact'.

  
How it works:
  
  

  
1. With no DAK: Must be sneaking.
With Dynamic Activation Key: *hold shift then press E.* Point your cursor until you get the 'search corpse' message, then press SHIFT and hold it until the message changes to 'feed on corpse'. Must NOT be sneaking, until I edit that, to get the effects, though you can still feed for hunger purposes.
  
2. Savage Cannibalism: uses DAK, and lets you hook into everything that Savage Cannibalism does.

  
**Namira's Blessing is Green Pact** 
  
  
Rename the vanilla Namira's Blessing effect to 'Green Pact' in your active effects. Purely for immersion. Alternatively, the Racial Skills and Levelling version redirects the effects in case that mod alters them in future.
  
  
Wintersun options for both (not yet in main FOMOD, check the update files). *This actually might be overwriting the original effects, preventing them from applying at all, I need to troubleshoot this. It should work fine if you want to use the* actualy*ring of namira.*
