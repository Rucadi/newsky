This patch makes the Vigilants attack you when you're an ACTUAL Daedra worshipper via Wintersun, rather than because you got too far into the Thieves' Guild questline or picked up Dawnbreaker. Requires both Extended Encounters and Wintersun. The optional file is an alternate version that adds the Wintersun conditions in ADDITION to the original ones, so if you either follow a Daedra OR do their quest you'll be attacked. ESL-flagged plugins.
