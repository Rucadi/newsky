Summary

  
  
[Lucien - Immersive Fully Voiced Male Follower](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20035)﻿ is one of the greatest follower mods to be created for Skyrim. Unfortunately for me, during the associated quest in Dumzbthar, my computer was suffering significant dips in FPS because of the concurrent use of [Dwemer Pipework Reworked](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46507?)used by [DarkLadyLexy's Skyrim SE Modding Guide](https://lexyslotd.com/). This patch aims to add room markers to Dumzbthar to help with performance optimization. It does not change the dungeon or quest in any other way.
  
  

Installation

1. Install [Lucien - Immersive Fully Voiced Male Follower](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20035) by Joseph Russell using the mod manager of your choice.
  
2. Install Lucien - Room Markers for Dumzbthar to load after Lucien.esp.
  
  

Compatibility

[left][size=2][/left][/size]1. A new game is required since room markers are persistent.
  
2. Should be compatible with everything, unless it also edits Dumzbthar.
  
  

FAQ

1. I don't use Dwemer Pipework Reworked, do I need this patch?
  
-Probably not, unless you are experiencing drops in framerates. If you are, this may improve performance because it only adds room markers, portals, and
  
occlusion planes.
  
  
2. I am still dropping framerates with this patch!
  
-Sorry! There's probably not much more I can do.
