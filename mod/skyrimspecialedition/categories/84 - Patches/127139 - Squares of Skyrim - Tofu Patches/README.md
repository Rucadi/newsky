If a character in displayed text (subtitles, book, etc.) is not included in Skyrim's font, it displays as a square instead of the intended glyph. [Text Square Fix Tool](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120551) is a lovely tool to generate patches for this and has a deeper explanation. I encourage you to use that mod and generate a full patch for your load order, and update it as you add/remove mods.
  
  
For those that don't want to set up another tool or manage updates, I'm providing a few pre-built patches.
  
  
All of these patches target SSE (English) and if they've been tested directly it's been on version 1.5.97. They are ESL-flagged ESPs.
  
  
This mod replaces three other mods for individual patches; they are now included in this FOMOD version, along with others.
