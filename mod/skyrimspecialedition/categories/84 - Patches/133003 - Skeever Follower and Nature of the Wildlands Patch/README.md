The follower mod Skeever (which is the **BEST** follower mod for Skyrim **I WILL FIGHT YOU**) edits the landscape outside of Riverwood to accommodate the added location Riverwood Hall of the Dead.
  
  
Nature of the Wildlands adds a few trees there which results in some floaters. I just moved them down.
  
  
Pretty advanced stuff honestly, I should definitely get mod of the month.
