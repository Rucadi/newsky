PLEASE BE AWARE that the COIN patch is outdated  - go to https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36042?tab=description for  the up to date patch, thanks!
  
  
  
  
I just made the jump from MLU to OWL and noticed some mods that I use in every PL needed patches.
  
  
I made those just now, using the conflict filter on xedit, so please let me know if I screw up something :)
  
  
  
C.O.I.N: xedit showed some containers and leveled item conflitcs, so i fowarded just the gold changes from Coin, keeping the rest as intended by OWL.
  
  
Artefake: just one actor inventory conflict.
  
  
Both are espfes.
