[Song of the Green NPC follower Auri](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11278) have been given relevant perks for her role as a sneaky archer.
  
  
She is also proficient in wielding dual daggers, and will never trigger any traps.
  
Her bow is now set as elven light bow and her bone arrows are now elven instead of dragonbone(!!!) while still keeping the original bone arrow mesh.
  
  
She will no longer one shot everything, but she will still be a very powerful team member. Feel free to give her as many dragonbone arrows as you wish, when you get to the point where you can make some. No more cheese with crafting bone arrows and shoot everything and anyone dead in one hit from level 1.
  
  
I originally added Auri to the Requiem follower framework. But that prevented me from setting the esl flag to save an esp slot.
  
As the Requiem follower framework is primarily used to allow a follower to lockpick for you, I deleted the script from the mod. Because Auri can't pick a lock if her life depended on it.
  
  
I left the script in the script folder if someone wishes to add her themselves.
  
  
I have also created a patch for the [Auri Deluxe visual overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58404) for the VANILLA body (I have UNP not CBBE in my load order).
  
  
And a small compatibility mod for [the Immersive Divine Blessing (SSE Conversion) mod.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61297)﻿
  
  
You have to run the Reqtificator.
