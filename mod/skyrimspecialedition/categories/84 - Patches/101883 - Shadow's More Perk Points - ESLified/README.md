I ESLified the 20% and 50% More Perk Points mods as well as the Perk Points at Skill Levels 50-75-100 mod from the Ordinator mod page 
  
  
Any combination of these can be used together if desired

If upgrading from the original ESP versions from the Ordinator mod page on an existing save, you WILL MOST LIKELY be retroactively given perk points on top of the extra perk points already given to you while you were using the ESP version of the mod.
  
  
To correct this, figure out how many perk points you have currently before you upgrade to these ESL versions, then see how many you have after. For each extra perk point given from this error, you can go buy a single perk you haven't yet, then open command console and type `help "<perk name>"` to get the perks code. Then you can type `player.removeperk <perkcode>` to remove the perk you just purchased. This is best done with a perk that only has one level, so you don't have to figure out which perk code is for what level of a perk. Repeat this process until all extra retroactively given perk points are removed.
  
  
So for example, on a fairly new save, I could get Destruction Dual Casting, then I would open the console and type `help "Destruction Dual Casting"`. I would then copy the perk code, and type `player.removeperk 000153CF`. I would then repeat this process until all extra retroactively given perk points are removed.
