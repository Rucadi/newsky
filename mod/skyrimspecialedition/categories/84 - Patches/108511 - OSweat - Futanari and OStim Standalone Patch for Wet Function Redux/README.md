**﻿OSweat - Futanari and OStim Standalone Patch for Wet Function Redux**

  
This patch adds futanari support and allows the user to activate certain settings without SexLab Aroused. Additionally, OStim Standalone optional integration has been introduced to Wet Function Redux (WFR).
  
  

**List of Features**

  
- **Wet Pussy Texture**: Can now be used without SexLab Aroused. When toggled on, it'll be applied when a character's wetness level exceeds 1/4 of the overall wetness cap. Users have the option to enable or disable SexLab Aroused's arousal threshold if it is installed. If enabled, the selected threshold is used instead of the previously mentioned rule.
  
  
- **Futanari Support**: Toggle for female schlong specular textures available; it is disabled by default. Appears based off 1/4 rule as well. Provided texture is for BnP - Female Skin's UNP WFR Patch paired with TRX - Futanari Addon. To replace with a custom file, name your texture *wetschlong\_s.dds* and place it in *textures/actors/character/wetfunction*.
  
  
- **OStim Standalone Integration**: Almost all the settings available for SexLab now have an OStim counterpart for those using that sex framework. This includes features like *Player Only* or *Auto-apply*.
  
  
- **OStim NPC-NPC Scene Support**: **Requires OTracker.** The mod only supports scenes involving the player by default. With OTracker installed, users can choose whether they want this feature or not via MCM settings.
  
  

**Installation**

  
Read the description of Wet Function Redux and ensure you have all the necessary requirements before installing it. Install this patch and allow it to overwrite WFR. If you want NPC-NPC scene support for OStim, install OTracker.
  
  

**Compatibility**

  
The futanari support is currently only for Schlongs of Skyrim addons. 3D pubic hair SOS mods will be safely ignored.
  
  
**Setting Loader Status: currently compatible.**
  
  
Get the [compatible setting loader here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78025?tab=files&file_id=479319&nmm=1).
  
  
Load order:
  

  
1. Wet Function Redux
OSweat
  
2. Setting Loader

**Troubleshooting**

  
If you're having problems with Wet Function Redux's MCM not showing, you should give [Papyrus Tweaks NG](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77779) a try. This may or may not help, no guarantees.
