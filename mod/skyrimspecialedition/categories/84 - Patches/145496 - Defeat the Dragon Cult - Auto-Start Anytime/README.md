Thanks to [Gothos25](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/36481965) for making [Defeat the Dragon Cult](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86625) open permissions. Based on comments on that mod requesting "could this be done earlier", or "I'm already past the first Alduin fight but would still like to have this", I have stuck the quest start on the Story Manager so its start is not dependent on one specific line of dialogue with Paarthurnax. The original mod is still required.
  
  
Updates from Original Mod
  
  

  
* The quest is now named "Defeat the Dragon Cult", per the mod title.
The mod can now be installed and started at any time, and the quest trigger is no longer dependent on a single event.[list]
  
* **Throat of the World Version**: The quest will now start any time after you first ask Arngeir about Dragonrend. (Aligns with the start of the mod [Strong Voice / SV Paarthurnax](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/145493)﻿.)
**Elder Knowledge Version**: The quest will now start any time after you first ask Paarthurnax about Dragonrend. (Aligns with the original [Defeat the Dragon Cult](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86625)﻿ quest trigger.)
  

  
[\*]The mod should now register any Dragon Priests killed before installation (triggered when you next kill a Dragon Priest).
  
[\*]Improved readability of the "Note from Esbern" and remove some references from the note that could be considered spoilers.
