Fixes and tweaks several aspects of [RASS](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22780) to avoid instances where the effects shouldn't be visible.
  
  
Includes a patch for [NAT III Weathers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27141). (also compatible with [NAT CS III](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/139567))
  
My [RASS - NAT III Weathers patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/147411) is not needed if you use this one.
  
  
  
  
*- Removed particle effects (not including membrane shader effects such as snowy hands) and cold breath from the player in 1st person view due to the effects looking off (this doesn't affect other NPCs when in 1st person and has no effect if the player is in 3rd person)
  
- Removed all effects in caves and other interiors where they shouldn't apply (affects both NPCs and the player)*
  
  
  
**Optional "No Animal Shader" File:**
  
*- Removes all effects from animals except cold breath to avoid instances where some animals are glowing brightly with the shader active
