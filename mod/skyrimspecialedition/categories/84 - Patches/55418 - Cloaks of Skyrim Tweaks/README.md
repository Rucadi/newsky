[font=Trebuchet MS]A few tweaks for Cloaks of Skyrim. Both patches are ESLified.
  
  
**Name consistency Patch:** no more hyphens (eg. Cloak - Black Hide changed to Black Hide Cloak). Some are minor consistent change to vanilla gears (eg. Greybeard Mantle changed to Greybeard's Mantle so it aligns with Greybeard's Robe/Hood/Boots). Most unique cloak names are not touched.
  
  
**Crafting Tweaks Patch:** now does not require the book Fryssa the Wide's Nordic Tailoring to craft anymore. The recipe of the book is removed as well (you can still find the books in leveled lists, Dragonsreach and the College of Winterhold).[/font]
