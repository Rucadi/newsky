This mod patches the various weapons and armor mods that I use to (hopefully) follow the logic of deletepch's Open World Loot.
  
  
Currently patched: 
  
  
- NordWarUA's Armor Variants
  
- Unplayable Factions Armor
  
- Lovely Long Swords (WACCF Version Only)
  
- Katana Crafting
  
- Heavy Armory
  
- Jaysus Swords SE
  
- Immersive Weapons

The N.A.V patch adds the various armor and weapons from N.A.V to the level lists Open World Loot has established with a bit of tweaking.
  
  
Based on JDJ3's description, I've tried to add armours based on the material to their respective level list in order to expand the pool of used armours where it makes sense. 
  
  
For example, the Steel Scale Mail Armor set would obviously be added to the Scale Level Lists. However, the Cyrodilic Chainmail Armor set has the Scaled Armor designation despite first impressions of being it possibly steel or iron. That too has been added to OWL's Scaled Level List. 
  
  
Using this logic, hopefully you will encounter the armours and weapons with a consistent manner as per OWL's design.
  
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
The U.F.A patch mainly adds the Alik'r weapons and armors, in addition to the Silver Hand Weaponry, to the respective OWL level lists. So you should see the the respective factions utilizing a mix of both OWL and patched content.
  
  
I've forwarded U.F.A's outfit changes where necessary, so Silver Hand and Vigilant members get their new outfits rather than the using OWL/Vanilla ones. I figure if you're using U.F.A, that's what you're after right?
  
  
You should also see the Khajiti caravans selling the U.F.A Alik'r and Silver Hand weapons as well.
  
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
The Lovely Longswords Patch requires both the original plugin (WACCF) and the fixed version for a better experience. It'll be linked in the requirements for the patches so you should easily be able to find them. Please read the instructions on each page and fully install the files before using the patch!
  
  
I simply added the longswords of each material to the great swords level lists from OWL. In case you ask, I'm not doing the non-WACCF versions. deletepch has given instructions on how to make a patch for OWL if you're so inclined.
  
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
The Katana Crafting patch adds the weapons to the Dagger, Swords and Greatsword level lists from OWL. So now you can see them integrated in-game rather than just being crafted only.
  
  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
The Heavy Armory patch adds the various weapons according to the material and animation type to their respective OWL level list.
  
  
For example, a shortsword will go in the sword level lists depending on the material. A halberd meanwhile would be put into battleaxe list and so on.
  
If you would like more info, please head to the Heavy Armory mod page for a more in-depth breakdown on each of the new weapon's categories.
  
  
Thanks to [iarna](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/9560336)'s [Open World Loot Patches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49964) which helped form the basis of this patch. If you are going to use Animated Armory and Heavy Armory and their patches together, I recommended using using this [balancing script](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19547) by [wherediditrun](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/40633695). It helps with variety by renaming some weapons and adjusting stats. The instructions are concise so you should have no issues.
  
  
------------------29/08/21 Update----------------
  
  
I've since switched over to [Animated Heavy Armory](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51100) by [dreadflopp](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/353369). From my initial checking, my Heavy Armory Patch should work with the full version of the mod only. If you elect to not install certain weapon types then my patch will have most likely have errors. Please feel free to use my patch as a base and delete any error entries. That should make it work with your installation. If you do, feel free to upload the patch/send it to me to upload.
  
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
  
The Jaysus Swords Patch is for the full version only. It simply adds the various weapons that were included in the original plugin's level lists and adds them to OWL's instead. The weapons that were placed in certain locations around Skyrim or on NPCs has been kept in the patch so you're not going find Excalibur on a Level 5 bandit when you're not supposed to. At least according to the original plugin.
  
  
Again this patch is for the full version only. If you're using the crafting only version or the lore friendly version of any kind, the patch will not work. You have been warned.
  
  
\*Excalibur is not an actual weapon in Jaysus Swords SE. Just the first one that came to mind.
  
  
---------------30/08/2021 Update------------------------
  
  
[Takokun01](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/3406432) has kindly provided a craft-only version patch of Jaysus Swords ﻿for OWL. Intended to be used with the CCOR patch on [kryptopyr's patch hub](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19518). I would advise deleting the level list entries in the JSwords CCOR plugin but I leave that up to you.
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  
The Immersive Weapons Patch is pretty basic in that I tried to slot each weapon where I felt it was appropriate. This was based on weapon material type, style of weapon etc. I also based my patch on the WACCF\_CCOR patch as well, so if you don't use it then some weapons might be off. The patch will still work however.
  
  
A few things to note are that I shamelessly took inspiration from [TateTaylorUSA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/61720101)﻿'s [Pirates Wield Cutlasses](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31753)﻿ with IW's cutlasses. Sailors and pirates will now use of variety of cutlasses instead of scimitars to make them more unique compared to Redguard/Alik'r warriors. Speaking of them, they get to play with more scimitars too. Of course you can find them for sale at the Khajiiti Caravans.
  
  
The Glass+ cutlasses/scimitars will only be sold by the Caravans however.

This is the first time I've made patches myself and uploaded them to the nexus so it's very likely there's some issues here or there. Feel free to use it as the basis for your own patch if you want to. If you upload it to the nexus, please just give credit and send me a link to the mod page so I can update this page.
  
  
I'm not much of a modder so I don't know how much help I can give with any issues.
  
  
Patches are flagged as an ESL so they won't take up a slot in your load order.
  
  
-------Installation----------------
  
  
Obviously requires the list file you are trying to patch and deletepch's Open World Loot to function properly. 
  
  
To install, download with the mod manager of choice and active the ESP.
  
  
To manually install, download the mod manually, extract the ESP and put into your Skyrim Special Edition data folder. Don't forgot to activate the ESP.
