Cleaned the plugin, trimmed some of the bloat and fixed a few issues based on [LazyAltmer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/774541) instructions published in the Bosmer Armor Pack comments sections <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5597>.
  
  
Level lists and balancing have been improved, and the outfits changes are preserved on the 4 named NPCs.
  
  
Requires the original mod still, use this plugin as a replacer by installing this mod after and giving it priority overwrite.
