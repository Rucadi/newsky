This modifies the pocket dimension world in the Lost Grimoire mod, adding trees, places to sit, and more chests, making it a more cozy and useful experience while using the spell.
  
Added - 6 chests.
  
Added - 2 Gildergreen saplings in the crafting area.
  
Added - 2 benches with small decorations on them to eat food on.
  
Added - 2 thrones at the top to relax on.
  
Added - 2 comfy chairs, each under a tree.
  
Added - 2 combat dummies.
  
Added - A very large pool to bathe in.
  
Added - 6 beds
  
Added - 1 empty platform for use with Hearthcraft. Hearthcraft is optional and not required for the mod.
  
Added - Surrounded the entire pocket dimension with the sphere you see while inside Azura's star, to truly make it feel shut off and like your own pocket dimension.
  
Added - A shrine to Azura in the empty platform, requested by a friend. The shrine works with Pilgrim.
  
  
Added - Behind the scenes, I added more falling triggers so that no matter where you are, you won't fall forever. This wasn't an issue in the original mod, but because I expanded the size of the area, this is now necessary.
  
  
  
This is my first mod! I know it's not much, but I am very proud of how it came out. Thank you to Steelfeathers for the permission to upload this mod.
  
If anybody has any issues or errors with the mod, please, let me know.
  
REQUIRES LOST GRIMOIRE SSE (or you won't be able to access the dimension lol...)
  
  
v1\_4 fixes the clipping chests and adds a chair under the other tree as well for symmetry.
  
v1\_5 adds a pool and makes the mod ESL.
  
v1\_7 fixes the issue where you would get a cyclic conflict in LOOT due to it being the wrong plugin type. Sorry! It is still able to be marked as ESL.
  
v2\_3 is a general redesign update, making the pool larger, adding more beds, and adding an empty platform for use with Hearthcraft.
