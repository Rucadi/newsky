**Compatibility patch for Requiem and Survival Mode.****Since the other Survival Mode patches were not to my liking, I decided to make my own.**
  
  
*- All food has been patched to reduce hunger
  
- Orcs and Woodelves are resistant to eating raw food (Khajit and Argonian were already resistant)
  
- Added Flame Cloak functionality
  
- Requiem disease system is completely overwritten with Survival Modes disease system
  
- Lower carry weight is disabled
  
- Fixed health regeneration problems
  
- Some other small compatibility related things
  
- Removed attack speed penalty from the hunger debuff (fixes an issue with high attack speed)
  
  
Compatible with my [Survival Mode Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65425).
