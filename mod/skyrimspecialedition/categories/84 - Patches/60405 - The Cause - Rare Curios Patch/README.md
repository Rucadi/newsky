# The Cause - Rare Curios Patch

**What does this mod do?**
  
  
Replaces the Welkynd Stones in The Cause with the Welkynd Stones from Rare Curios, so they stack in your inventory. Doing this requires touching a few things other mods also touch, so some additional patches are also available to fix that.
  
  
Includes an optional file that distributes Flawed Varla Stones (as a 25% chance drop) into the Ayleid "special loot" containers added alongside the Anniversary Update. This does not touch any other distribution of these stones so will be fully compatible with any mods removing them from other loot. This is ***not*** compatible with the similar patch found on my Rare Curios - BS Bruma Synergy Patch page.
