# Missives are in Skyrim

Missives is a great mod, but when playing with a bunch of mods that add new locations to the game, some of its missions end up sending you to entirely different worldspaces.
  
  
**What does it do?**
  

  
* This mods limits the letter, potion and weapon delivery missions to the main Skyrim holds.
It should be safe to add or remove during your game.
  
* It (probably) won't effect any currently running Missive quest.
The main file does not change any Missive patches that add additional worldspace support - those can limit their own locations if they like, or I might make additional patches here.
  
* There is an optional file that maintains compatability with the Economy Overhaul Speechcraft (Lite) patch for Missives, if you're using that.
It's a simple ESL-flagged file that won't take up a slot in your load order.
  

  
**For self-patching**
  

  
* You can change the list of locations where the delivery is allowed to go by overring [font=Courier New]\_M\_ListOfSkyrimHolds [/font]via your own custom patch :)
