**Antlers Patch

  
  
Why?**
  
  
Some months ago, cuyima pushed an update for their antlers mod, which introduced improved and custom textures for the antlers. However, 'Bosmer NPCs have Antlers' was not updated since, and its antlers meshes still point to vanilla textures, making the game look inconsistent.
  
  
**How?**
  
  
This mod is a direct mesh replacer. It replaces the NPC antlers meshes with the ones shipped by cuyima's player version. The only difference is that I needed to swap the mesh partition to 60 in OutfitStudio to make them show up in game.
