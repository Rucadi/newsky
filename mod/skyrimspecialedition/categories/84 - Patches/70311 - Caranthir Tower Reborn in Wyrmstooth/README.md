**Description**
  
  
As my Skyrim worldspace is getting rather full and several other worldspace mods still had some room, I decided to move certain mods to other worldspaces.
  
[Caranthir Tower Reborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4269/), being the first. As such, I moved it over to [Wyrmstooth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45565).
  
  
You need to have completed the main quest of Wyrmstooth and travelled back to one of Skyrim captital cities for the Caranthir Tower quest to start. (This is done for better compatibility with JaySerpa's [Gate to Sovngarde](https://next.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/collections/qdurkx?tab=mods) list.)
  
  
For information where it can be found now, please refer to the screenshots.
  
  
For v1.1, I got permission from Darkfox127 to actually make this mod into a replacer ESP. This fixes many conflicts between other mods that affected the area and as such less patches are needed. **You still need all the other assets from the original mod though, but you can replace its ESP with this one.**
  
  
**Known Issues**
  
  
- Sometimes the dragon guardian refuses to land, and gets stuck circling in mid-air. To fix this, you should move a bit further down the mountain, so he has room to land.
  
- During testing, the sword got stuck inside the receptacle after defeating the dragon guardian. I don't know how that happened, but it seemed to be very rare. I had to resort to an earlier save and try again.
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
  
~~I added patches for the [Bloodchill Manor CC Creation](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Bloodchill_Manor), [Inigo](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1461) and for both. If you use both, do not use the other 2 patches, however you do need [Elianora's Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58317) for Bloodchil manor + Inigo in that case.~~From v1.1 onwards, Bloodchill Manor and Inigo no longer need a patch, since I now use a replacer ESP which removes all edits to that area which had a conflict between the 3 mods.
  
  
There's also a patch for [Caranthir Tower Reborn Quest Expansion Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62755) available in the optional downloads.
  
  
**FAQ**
  
  
Q: Can you move the tower to <insert other location>?
  
A: Sorry, but I have no plans to do so.
  
  
Q: ESPFE?
  
A: ~~Yes.~~ The patches are. The main mod is now a replacer ESP.
  
  
Q: Does installing/updating/uninstalling on an existing save work?
  
A: As far as I know, it should. However, it's good practice to keep a backup save prior to doing this, just in case.
  
  
Q: Is this compatible with <insert mod>?
  
A: I don't know by heart. You might need to check yourself.
  
  
Q: Will you make a patch for <insert mod>?
  
A: Only if it's a mod I use myself or plan on using, I have enough time and I actually like the idea. Otherwise, feel free to do it yourself. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: I have a suggestion to improve the mod. Can you do it?
  
A: Maybe, if I have time and I like the idea, I'll consider it.
  
  
Q: Will you port this to <insert platform>?
  
A: No, I myself only support the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If someone else wants to port it, feel free. (see permission) If you decide to port it, you yourself take full responsibility to offer support to said port. I will not provide no support for any ports by third parties.
  
  
Q: I use a ported version of this mod on <insert platform> and I have a problem. Can you help?
  
A: I don't provide any support for third party ports on other platforms than the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If you have issues, you should adress the person that ported it.
  
  
Q: Does this work on Skyrim 1.6+, aka "Anniversary Edition"?
  
A: Yes, it should.
  
  
Q: Why don't your mods use MCMs and instead use this janky console command system to set globals?
  
A: I am not a fan of MCMs. You can set the globals by making a patch in xEdit. I have no plans of changing this. If you want to add an MCM, feel free. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: Why don't you use FOMODs?
  
A: That would require reuploading the entire mod, in question, even if I only make a small change. My internet is limited and reuploading the files each time will take a huge chunk of my monthly volume.
