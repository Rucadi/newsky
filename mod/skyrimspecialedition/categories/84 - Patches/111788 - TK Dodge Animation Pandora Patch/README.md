Just convert the motion data which save  in the animationdatasinglefile.txt file to animation file
  
Fixed by using AMR to transfer the animation annotation
  
The problem that the default Tk dodge still stays in place after Dodge.

**Install**

Place the file **After Tk dodge SE or RE** so that the animation file overwrites the original

  
  
  

**Notice**
  
Only Default TK animations have been fixed
  
If you use a different animation and encounter the same problem,
  
you must notify the animation author
  
Or add AMR annotations yourself
