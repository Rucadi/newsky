# Animated Armoury Bound Weapons - Adamant Patch
- Author: Xgatt

**Overview**
  
  
Animated Armory's bound versions of the added weapons (Claws, Rapiers, Katanas, Whips, Pikes, Halberds, Quarterstaves) did not take advantage of Adamant's bound weapon perks, nor were they consistent in spell level, cost, charge time, etc. with Adamant bound weapons. This patch makes it all work together.
  
  
**Changes**
  
**Perk Compatibility**
  
  
All of Animated Armory bound weapons now make use of Adamant Perks:
  
> ﻿**Arcane Weapon (20):** Bound weapons last five times longer.
>   
> **Daedric Prey (30/60):** Bound weapons absorb Magicka and Stamina / Health, Magicka, and Stamina from their targets.
>   
> **Mystic Binding (40/80):**Bound weapons deal extra damage/ even more damage.
>   
> **Haunting Curse (90):** Bound weapons reduce enemy Magic Resistance by 25% for 10 seconds.

  
**Spell Consistency**Bound weapons in Adamant follow a fairly standard cost and level progression:
  

  
1. Dagger - Novice
Sword / One Handed Weapon - Apprentice
  
2. 2 Handed Weapon - Adept

  
All Animated Armory variants have been made consistent with this progression, along with spell cost and skill use multipliers. Claws / Rapier are Novice. Whip / Katana are Apprentice. QStaff / Pike / Halberd are Adept.

**Installation**
  
Install with mod manager below both the above mods. Should be safe to install mid game, but be careful uninstalling mid game, especially if you have the bound weapon summoned / active on your save.
  
**Known Issues**
  
  
Animated Armory's Bound Whips are invisible when equipped. This is an issue with the original mod as of 2.3, and an update should fix it.
