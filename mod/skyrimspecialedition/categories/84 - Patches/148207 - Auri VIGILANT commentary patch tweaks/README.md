* Fixed the missing Quest Condition in Dialog Topic XX0AA1FA.
Changed Quest Conditions for Dialog Topics XX0812F5 and XX0812F8 from zzzCHMemoryQuest02 to zzzCHMQ01.
  
* Auri will now automatically follow you to certain inaccessible locations (where she has idles) during VIGILANT questline, such as Bruiant Estate and Coldharbour,provided she's your active teammate and not in waiting. She will also follow you back to Skyrim for final dialogue after completing VIGILANT questline.
The ending narration with Auri will now only display the ending you actually achieved.
  
* After Auri says she needs to rest, she will now actually leave the team.

  
\*If you want to convert the VIGILANT commentary patch to ESPFE, make sure their ESPs are loaded together in SSEEdit.
