Just a small patch I made because I can't remove JK's Skyrim from my load order and I absolutely need to download anything with "Beyond Skyrim" in the name. So here it is. I just moved the boat towards the city, near Silus' house. The navmesh has been redone and the plugin cleaned with xEdit. Enjoy !
  
  
N.B.: for those of you who happen to use [Cities of the North : Dawnstar](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28952), I also uploaded a patch there. If you use COTN + JK, you need both patches.
