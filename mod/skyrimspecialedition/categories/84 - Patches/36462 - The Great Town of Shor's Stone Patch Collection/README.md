Continuing with my series of "I want to run with unique architecture everywhere, but that requires SO MANY compatibility patches" series....Shor's Stone! soldierofwar put together a lovely little overhaul of Shor's Stone in his [The Great Town of Shor's Stone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35977)﻿, and I've put together a series of compatibility patches for things in my load order which needed it. This one is delightfully small - not that many things which needed to be patched. All patches are ESP flagged as ESL, unless otherwise noted.
  
  
*Included Patch Descriptions*
  
  
[Interesting NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194) - shifts one bench to be accessible and one NPC spawn to properly be on navmesh. Last checked against version 4.5
  
[AI Overhaul SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21654) - shifts three placed idle markers to match the new exteriors. Last checked against version 1.5.3.
  
  
[Atlas Map Markers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24104) - NOTE: Based off MCM version. Adds map marker for inn, store, and temple. MCM toggles supported. AMM patches are being released for other patch collections , and will require end-user CR between patches in order for MCM toggling to work for everything. Last checked against version 2.0
  
  
Birds of Skyrim - Last checked against version I dunno. I don't have it! Shifts a couple birds. I downloaded the LE version and renamed it and looked at the patch and it seemed fine? Patch provided by NexusBla18
  
  
[Cheesemod for EVERYONE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36506) - Shifts a few added cheeses to match the new interior. Last checked against version 1.0
  
  
[Elder Scrolls Online Imports](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11729) - So this one's a bit of an odd duck as far as compatibility patches from me are concerned. Usually it's a matter of moving something, or tying things together, including both or one or the other, etc. In this case, both ESO Imports and TGToSS add Fallowstone Hall. So normally I'd pick one or the other. But they're in COMPLETELY different capacities - TGToSS has an occupied hall that has NPCs and items and a vault, and a bunch of stuff like that. ESO Imports has a ruined hall that still has an in-tact basement crypt which is a dungeon, and also includes some unique items. So it's not like either can replace the other. I attempted to bridge the gap by shifting and re-naming a few things from ESO Imports to make it effectively that there was a former site that was abandoned, it's explicitly a crypt, etc. But there's not actually any lore evidence for this anywhere. So if you're someone who wants to make sure you stay as close to lore as possible, you may want to just choose one or the other of the two. For those of you who want both, both are available, and now their names don't overlap, at least. Last checked against version 7.0.
  
  
[Enhanced Landscapes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18162) - Last checked against version 2.0.1. Disables some trees, shifts some others, disables some cliffs that clip with the new path. Patch provided by NexusBla18
  
  
[Enhanced Lights and FX](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2424) ﻿- Only one patch this time around, due to there being a few new buildings and wanting to keep consistency in lighting mood across all of them. Forwards any conflicts having Great Town of Shor's Stone win, shifted any added smoke to match the new interiors, and shifted door lights where appropriate. Last checked against version 3.06.
  
  
[Embers HD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14368) - Forwards the disabling of a fire such that Embers and GToSS can be loaded in any order. Last checked against version 1.3998
  
  
[Embers XD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37085) - Shifts the placement of fires to better utilize the new look of Embers XD, includes some ashes spread around, and in a few places substitutes
  
fire types to better match aesthetics. Last checked against version 2.1.1.
  
  
[Holidays](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1533)﻿ - shifts a bunch of stuff to match the new building layout, adds some new poles so ropes aren't just floating out into the ether. Last checked against version 2.14
  
  
[Inns and Taverns](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12223) - Removes the Hunter's Rest, as there was no real purpose behind having two inns in such a small town. Last checked against version 1.2
  
  
[Lanterns of Skyrim II](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30817) ﻿- Shifts a few lanterns to match the new exteriors. Shifts the blacksmith forge light to match its new location. Last checked against version 2.0
  
  
[More to Say](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22622) - just forwarding a persistency/spawn reference point for a couple NPCs. Specifically for the More to Say Shor's Stone patch. Last checked against
  
 version 6.0.2
  
  
[Obsidian Mountain Fogs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13539) - Forwards the Great Town of Shor's Stone's disabling of a mountain fog so you can see the Keep, allowing the two mods to be load order agnostic. Last checked against version 1.21
  
  
Redguard Elite Armaments - CC patch. Shifts an NPC spawn to be on top of navmesh.
  
  
[RS Children Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2650) - Makes the added child work with RS Children Overhaul. I couldn't seem to get the facegen to export, so this ended up being a bit of a work-around, and the child is a clone of another kid elsewhere in Skyrim. You'd probably have never noticed if I didn't say anything. Last checked against version 1.1.3.
  
  
[Snazzy Furniture and Clutter Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2414) - Shifts placed paintings to match new interiors. Last checked against version 1.7
  
  
[Skyrim's Unique Treasures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5261) - Shifts the location of three placed objects to match the new interiors. Last checked against version 4.4
  
  
[Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266) - Conflict resolution patch which forwards some persistancy/keywords which were added, and disables one exterior plant which was half clipping through an object and didn't look correct. Last checked against version 4.2.3.
  
  
[Verdant](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2296) Patch - DOES NOT REQUIRE VERDANT AS MASTER. Verdant adds grass to a couple texture types which makes a few paths seem more overgrown than they should have. This patch re-paints those stretches to be types which don't have grass, for Verdant. It may assist with other grass mods that do the same, as well, so master is not set.
  
  
Other patches I'm aware of: [Immersive Laundry](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42423?), [Medieval Lanterns of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65198)
  
  
*Installation*
  
Use a mod manager/organizer to install, or drop the loose files into you Skyrim data folder. Patches should have their appropriate masters set, and should be loaded after any mods which they are patching. Some of the fixes in question are on persistent objects, and may require a new save.
  
  
*Compatibility*
  
I don't believe this should introduce any incompatibilities beyond anything which may be present between base mods. All moved objects should have been moved to locations which are non-overlapping. Let me know if you hit anything
