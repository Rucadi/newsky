**IMPORTANT**: use ONLY with the BSA version of the mod. A fix for the loose file version is not needed.
  
  
This bugfix for [Interesting NPCs SE (3DNPC)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194?tab=posts) fixes a problem, where the player's movement would lock if they speak to a bard and choose to play a song with him.
  
  
The fix just contains bard-related voice files as loose files, wich fixes the problem. I recommend to install this fix only if you encounter this problem, as not everyone seems to have this bug.
