[Mandragorasprouts](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Mandragorasprouts/about-me?gameId=1704)﻿ took everyone by surprise with their amazing new [draugr](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/123170)﻿ models, but [The Restless Dead](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/94100) by [alanovichromanov](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/alanovichromanov/about-me?gameId=1704)﻿ uses custom meshes for it's new draugrs so this patch is here to fix that.
  
  
The new draugrs meshes have been edited using TRD's models as a base, along with a few custom textures for the cannibal variants and others. Several of these models aren't used by The Restless Dead just yet, but are placeholders for future updates.
  
  
if there's any issues, please let me know in the comment section. this was quite a bit of work, so it's very possible i may have borked something. everything works fine on my end and there's no glaringly obvious problems with any of the models. but if you do find something let me know which model it is and i should be able to take care of it pretty quickly.
  
  
2k Textures are provided in an optional file.
  
  
  
  
 **﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿Regarding the glowing eyes**
  
  
The glowing eye meshes included in the main file are invisible in game, so i've added a separate download for them using [Xtudo's](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Xtudo/about-me?gameId=1704)﻿ models as a base. so if you use their patch for the glowing eyes, download the optional file and overwrite the main file as well.
  
  
i'll be looking into a better more fitting option for the new models down the road if no one else does by then.
