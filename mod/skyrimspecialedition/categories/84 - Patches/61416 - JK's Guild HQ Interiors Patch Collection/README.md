# JK's Guild HQ Interiors Patch Collection
- Author: Czasior Teabag86 DrMonops and Janquel
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61416


Jkrojmal has been providing overhauls of various interiors, and they've found their way into basically everyone's load orders. Thankfully, the majority of mods don't need any patches, but there are a few item placements/general clean-up which we thought we'd share :) **All patches are ESP flagged as ESL**, unless otherwise noted. Many of these are *extremely* minor and honestly not always necessary, but ESLs don't take up a plugin slot, so....why not?
  
  
The general interiors page had gotten obnoxiously large (we actually literally had to have Nexus increase the character limit on articles in order to fit in all the details), and as he's starting on guild HQs and those tend to be "busier", so it warranted splitting into its own page. We'll likely do the same for "Minor cities" if he starts on those, and/or Dungeons. I don't foresee any other major splits.
  
  
[Normal interiors patches are over on this page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35910)
  
  
[Palaces and Castles Enhanced patches are over on this page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57714/)
  
  
If using PCE, use that link for any of the palaces, and this page for the rest of them. It will automatically ignore those ones in the FOMOD (as applicable. It's not applicable right now).
  
  
[College of Winterhold combos (and patches therein) for Immersive College of Winterhold and Obscure's College of Winterhold are on this page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67820)
  
  
If using OCW or ICOW with JK's College, use that link for the college of winterhold stuff, and this page for the rest.
  
  
Patches are included for the following mods. Generally speaking, if it's been included for one, it's been checked for all of them (or other patches already exist in the parents' FOMOD, like in the case for LOTD which handles most of the early ones), unless otherwise noted - I do plan on circling back around and universally checking for anything someone has provided a patch for, but that may not be for a bit.

[Holds Patching Center](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20685) has a bunch of patches for JK's Interiors, as well, so make sure to swing by there if you use Holds: The Cities Overhaul! Nothing for this one yet, but I'm sure Sette will get to it :)
  
  
Other mods I'm aware of: [player stripping in the added baths](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30265), [another player stripping added page which is JK-specific](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64396), [Window Shadows](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37831), [a bunch of newer Windows Shadows ones here, too](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55309), [Lux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43158), [ELFX Shadows Patch Hub](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64178), [Arnold's ELFX patches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/130260) (patches for Castle Volkihar and Fort Dawnguard).
  
  
*[Included Patch Details, along with links to all parent pages](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/3732)*
  
  
*Installation*
  
Use a mod manager/organizer to install, or drop the loose files into your Skyrim data folder. Patches should have their appropriate masters set, and should be loaded after any mods which they are patching. Some of the fixes in question are on persistent objects, and may require a new save.
  
  
*Compatibility*
  
I don't believe this should introduce any incompatibilities beyond anything which may be present between base mods. All moved objects should have been moved to locations which are non-overlapping. Let me know if you hit anything.
