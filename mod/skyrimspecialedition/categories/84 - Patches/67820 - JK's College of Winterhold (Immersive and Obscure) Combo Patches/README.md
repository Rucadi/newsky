Sorry, not feeling like making a funny quip-filled description this time :)
  
  
JK made a [College of Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65676). It's cool, and makes the college more "lived in" feel. Unlike most of the other interiors, there's already a few other overhauls, most notablly [Immersive College of Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17004), which makes it more like a "this is where high level mages do their shit", and [Obscure's College of Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20514), which makes it more like an actual school. They're both cool, too! There's also [Magical College of Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1539), by the by, which is also cool! There's also [Ultimate College of Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44797) which lets ICOW and OCOW play together! It's also also cool!
  
  
Mods are cool!
  
  
Anyway, this page lets JK's play with some of the others (currently ICOW and OCOW, MCOW I planned on looking at but man this is a lot all at once so that's gonna come later if it does....original impetus was because MCOW works on PS4, but since JKCOW includes its own assets I don't know if it can be ported there reasonably ANYWAY. So.....yeah).
  
  
*Included Patch Descriptions*
  
  
Immersive College of Winterhold
  
  
ICOW Patch - Patches everything. Just....everything. EVERYTHING. All of the ICOW quest stuff should still be there. Also the ICOW windows because I am a glutton for punishment.
  
  
[3DNPCs/Interesting NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194) - shifts a few indoor reference markers to match new interior, and shifts the ENTIRE bit of Gorr/Zora's quest outside Skytemple  Ruins to the other side of the ruins. It was theoretically possible to have the ruins destroyed by ICOW's quest simultaneous with that thing playing out  which....honestly, would have been borderline hilarious. Anyway, it *should* play out alright, but on the icy cliff behind the temple. Let me know if you run into  trouble. Last checked against version 4.4
  
  
[Additional Hearthfire Dolls](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46930) - Shifts two placed dolls to match new interiors. Last checked against version 3. Will not work with earlier versions.
  
  
[AI Overhaul SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21654) - Shifts a bunch of markers, CR on some NPC bases. Last checked against version 1.7, yes, it will work with either version, no you don't need Fishing. Additional combo version with SEF are available.
  
  
[Amorous Adventures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7305) - CR on the player's bed. Last checked against version 3.4. As far as I'm aware, should work with any version.
  
  
[Amorous Adventures Plus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39163) - Shifts marker to the payer's new room. Last checked against
  
  
[Amulets of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/487) - Moves a few amulets to their appropriate locations in the new interiors. Last checked against version 4.061
  
  
[Animated Armory (DAR Edition)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35978) - Shifts a bunch of the placed books to match the new interior. Last checked against version 2.3
  
  
Artifacts of Skyrim  - Artifacts adds a whole structure on top of the mound at Skytemple Ruins, which Immersive College of Winterhold also edits. The result is rather unsightly and there's a lot of object collision. Disabled the Artifacts edits in favor of Immersive College of Winterhold's. After all, during the Fall of Winterhold quest,
  
  
Spoilera dragon emerges from there, which would be hard to do with all that stuff in the way.
  
  
Helm of Yglar has been moved to compensate for this, it's next to the chest in the Skytemple Ruins. The patch also relocates the Provincial Artifacts - Volume IV, Skyrim book so it's no longer on the ground of the Arcanaeum. Latest version was the last one released, but this mod no longer looks available so.....sorry? Honestly only uploading this one because it was already done.
  
  
[BadGremlin's Collection AIO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15092) - Moves a placed jar and book to appropriate locations in the new interior. Last checked against version SE1
  
  
[Cassandra Frost Witch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4783) - Shifts book to not conflict with other objects. Note this is for the original mod, I'm sure there's like 50 versions out there some of which are compacted. If you note that your game is crashing with patches installed, my first response is going to be to screenshot this section of the description and post it in reply to you. Last checked against version 3.
  
  
[Cathedral 3D Mountain Flowers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41312)﻿ - CR on a single reference in Windhelm. Last checked against version 1.8
  
  
[Cheesemod for EVERYONE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36506) - Shifts a few added cheeses to match the new interior, CR on a number of references. Last checked against version 1.01
  
  
[Cloaks of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6369) - Moves placed cloaks and spinning wheel into to (at least somewhat) appropriate locations in the new interiors. Last checked against version 1.2.1
  
  
[Containers and Levelled List Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26575) - CR on 5 containers. Combo version with Tamrielic Culture and Mysticism also available. Last checked against version 1.2.5
  
  
[COTN Dawnstar](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28952) - Finally got off my ass and made these. Makes the scrying feature look at the new throne location instead of the void. I think. This will get  uploaded into the other patch collection too, but will be the same file. Last checked against version 1.2.1
  
  
[COTN Falkreath](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56731) - Finally got off my ass and made these. Makes the scrying feature look at the new throne location instead of the void.

[COTN Morthal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34168) - Finally got off my ass and made these. Makes the scrying feature look at the new throne location instead of the void. I think. This will get  uploaded into the other patch collection too, but will be the same file. Last checked against version 1.1
  
  
[COTN Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40088) - Finally got off my ass and made these. Makes the scrying feature look at the new throne location instead of the void.

Creation Club Goldbrand - Shifts a couple things (like a book and a cup and stuff) that were clipping.
  
  
Creation Club Gray Cowl Returns - Re-enables the Gray Fox's gravestone that ICOW disables and moves it slightly, and moves the Stranger's Journal so that the quest can be completed.
  
  
Creation Club Wild Horses - Shifts placement of a journal to match interior, also shifts spawn point of a unicorn to be on navmesh.
  
  
[Cutting Room Floor](https://www.afkmods.com/index.php?/files/file/1894-cutting-room-floor/) - When making this, rather than trying to get stuff to work in the Hall of Countenance, my brain went "man, there's a bunch of unused beds
  
over in the Hall of Attainment, let's just use that, since it'd also circumvent the conflict with M'rissi." So I did that! Orthorn moves into the basement in that hall instead. Last checked against version 3.1.11
  
  
[DX Merta Black Rose](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4843) - Shifts book to match new interior. Last checked against version 2.01
  
  
[Elder Scrolls Online Imports](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11729) - CR on a bunch of references (mostly alcohol which ICOW disables), changes a few newly placed alcohol to be the new ESO types, too. Combo patch with WACCF is also available. Last checked against version 8.1.1
  
  
[Enhanced Landscapes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18162) - Disables/shifts some mountain peaks to not overlap with stuff added near the secret hideout. Last checked against version 2.0.
  
  
[Enhanced Lights and FX](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2424) - Proves there is no God. Last checked against version 3.06
  
  
[Immersive College NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9252) - Shifts a few NPC markers and placements in the exterior to match new exterior. Last checked against version 1.1.02

[Daring Indoril Ordinator Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37981) - Shifts the chest to match new interior. Last checked against version 1
  
  
[JK's Blue Palace](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45324) - Finally got off my ass and made these. Makes the scrying feature look at the new throne location instead of the void. I think. This will get
  
uploaded into the other patch collection too, but will be the same file. Last checked against version 1.2.2
  
  
[JK's Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6289) - Shifts a bunch of little stuff near some of the teleport markers so they're still accessible/don't have stuff growing through them. Last checked against version 1.7
  
  
[Khajiit Will Follow](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2227) - Shifst Chaturjo to not clip through some added aesthetics from ICOW. Last checked against version 4.6.1
  
  
[Konahrik Accoutrements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22206) - Moves The Dragon Forge book upstairs, so that it's no longer laying on the floor in the Arcanaeum. Moves the Scroll of Abjuration in the Hall of Countenance to Colette Marence's room on her desk, so that it's no longer clipping inside of a shelf. Last checked against version 5.5.3
  
  
[Lanterns of Skyrim II](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30817) - CR on one or two lights, disables and rotates some of the blowing snow FX because LoS II had them going at like 90 degree angles to what ICOW added and it looked funny. Last checked against version 4
  
  
[Leviathan Axe](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40364) - Shifts a scroll onto a pile of other scrolls BECAUSE I'M EVIL MWAHAHAHA. Last checked against version 1.0beta
  
  
[Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802?) - Shifts a bunch of stuff to match the new interior. Last checked against version 5.6.3
  
  
[Legacy of the Dragonborn - Oblivion Artifacts](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30980) - CR on the Oblivion Artifacts patch
  
  
[Legacy of the Dragonborn - Tamrielic Culture](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30980) - CR on the Tamrielic Culture Patch
  
  
[Marshlands](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23062) - Disables one tree that was growing through the Morthal teleport marker. Last checked against version 1.
  
  
[Miscellaneous College of Winterhold Tweaks: Governable Gatekeeper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22653) - Since I'm making this page anyway, instead of requiring you to do load order, I made them load order agnostic following the instructions on that page. Last checked against version 1.5.1
  
  
[Morrowloot Ultimate](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3058) - Shifts some placed clothes and other objects to match new interior. Additionally, CR on Ancano's NPC base. Combo version with SRCEO available. Last checked against version 1.57
  
  
[Morrowloot Miscellania](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27094) - Same as the above, except without the Ancano's NPC base change, as MLM's touching this ref is ITPO (it does not give him a daedric dagger). Thus, combo patch with SRCEO is not necessary. Load ICOW after MLM, tho (or clean MLM). Last checked against version 1.3
  
  
[M'rissi's Tails of Trouble](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9666) - When making this, rather than trying to get stuff to work in the Hall of Countenance, my brain went "man, there's a bunch of unused beds over in the Hall of Attainment, let's just use that, since it'd also circumvent the conflict with CRF." So I did that! Additionally, updated a package and two quests to point to the new bed. There's also a bunch of stuff that M'rissi stuck outside the wall for some reason which....I don't really think has any purpose for existing, but I left it alone, outside the new wall. There's a lot of weird stuff this mod does like changing scale of some things to 0 so they're the size of an atom. Anyway, it should all work. Last checked against version 1.7
  
  
[Mystic Condenser](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10176) - Fixes placement of the Mystic Condenser, navmesh conflict. Last checked against version 2.3.
  
  
[Mysticism](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839) - CR on containers, shifts one placed spellbook. Last checked against version 2.0.6
  
  
[Not so Fast Mage's Guild](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5686) - Package combination for ICOW and NSF-MG so Ancano goes to ICOW's marker, but not until NSF-MG says to. Last checked against version 1.4. And after having made this one, someone keyed me in to [this one](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18731), which I somehow missed. It looks like there may be more to this one, so I'd recommend using that one until I have a chance to look into what it does (I might take mine down)
  
  
[Palaces and Castles Enhanced](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1819) - Finally got off my ass and made these. Makes the scrying feature look at the new throne location instead of the void. I think. This will get uploaded into the other patch collection too, but will be the same file. Last checked against version 2.3
  
  
[Quaint Raven Rock](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20851) - CR on some ash, shifts one other ash pile so it doesn't completely cover the teleport marker. This will get uploaded into the other patch  collection too, but will be the same file. Last checked against version 1.7.1
  
  
[Radiance Locations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45419) - CR on two refs and a location. Last checked against version 1.0.1.
  
  
[Royal Armory Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26398) - re-enables a disabled display case and puts it in an appropriate spot. Shouldn't be needed if you use the ICOW-specific version on the Royal Armory Tweaks page, I just happened to make it before I realized that version existed. Last checked against version 1.40
  
  
[Sepolcri](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34105) - Shifts a few markers to work properly with the teleport marker. Will work with the Sepolcri - JKs Skyrim patch. Last checked against version 1.2
  
  
[Skyrim Immersive Creatures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12680) - Shifts one placed book to match new interior of Arcaneum. Last checked against version 7.0.2
  
  
[Skyrim Project Optimization](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14084) - Adjusts occlusion planes where needed.
  
  
[Skyrim Revamped: Complete Enemy Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14598) - CR on Ancano's NPC base. Generally speaking, the higher number on any stat was chosen (you're playing on SRCEO), any spells/perks got  forwarded, packages from ICOW, and skills from SRCEO were chosen. Last checked against version 2.45
  
  
[Skyrims Unique Treasures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5261) - Shifts placed object to match new interior. Last checked against version 4.4
  
  
[Snazzy Furniture and Clutter Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2414) - CR on a bunch of furniture, applies SFCO types to things added by JK, shifts some paintings to match new interiors. Last checked against version 2.1. Also includes a TON of CR patches between the SFCO patch and other patches.
  
  
[Special Edition Followers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7622) - CR with ICOW on Onmund, J'zargo, and Brelyna. Generally speaking, ICOW won packages, outfit, and skills, SEF won class and max level, any perks got forwarded from both. Combo version with AIO available. Last checked against version 1.01
  
  
[Tamrielic Culture](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11418) - Shifts newly placed references in the Arcanaeum and the Arch-Mage's Quarters to match the new interior, as well as CR on one container. Combo patch with CLLF which contains changes of both included. Last checked against version 2
  
  
[The Great City of Winterhold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17127) - Navmesh patch, and also includes the ICOW patch stuff from the TGC page. Last checked against version 4.0.3
  
  
[Tools of Kagrenac](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14168) - Shifts placed references and objects to match new interior, disables placed bed which is redundant because ICOW adds so many. Last checked against version 1.59
  
  
[Weapons Armor Clothing and Clutter Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18994) - CR on the Archmage's Robes and outfit, CR on a bunch of stuff in the Hall of Attainment, "No Respawn" flag added to the added user room stuff from ICOW to match WACCF, and CR on the archmage's stuff. Verified with Monops that it's okay for the things referred to by the WACCF startup quest to be disabled. Last checked against version 2.8
  
  
[WACCF - Armor and Clothing Extension](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19002) - CR on stuff that ACE changes. Last checked against version 1.3
  
  
[Your Choices Matter - A Dark Brotherhood Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46871) - From the sticky, the included patch which uses a script doesn't always seem to work. This is CR and a tweak to a quest to do what the script was supposed to. It's explicitly for version 2.0.6 and isn't guaranteed to work on updates, since they're trying to get the script to work right.
  
  
Obscure's College of Winterhold
  
  
[JK's / Obscure's College of Winterhold features and patches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/4171)
  
  
There's also an addon for the JKs CoW - OCW patch made by Jaiim which alters the position of the door to the Midden (preferring Obscure's than JK's solution). You can find it [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70149).
  
  
*Installation*
  
Use a mod manager/organizer to install, or drop the loose files into you Skyrim data folder. Patches should have their appropriate masters set, and should be loaded after any mods which they are patching. Some of the fixes in question are on persistent objects, and will require a new save.
  
  
Install ONLY these patches, not the OCW (with a few exceptions mentioned in the [article](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/4171)), ICOW or JKCOW patches.
  
  
*Compatibility*
  
Patches work with themselves. No one else is stupid enough to try to make these work together, but other stuff might need patches which aren't included here.
