***A long long time ago in a galaxy not so far away...***
  
 [left] ﻿﻿Somewhere on the fringes of Nexus Land, yet another unknown psychopatchist emerged. Over several years of his unnecessary and overestimated toil, which made even a snail's pace seem like lightning speed, he crafted dozens of various surprisingly not-so-bad patches (at least, that's what people told him to keep him from falling into despair). While toiling away on these vast heaps of rubbish (alone or with other equally insignificant modders) of plugins for dedicated collections, he also created other, sometimes very tiny creations, so tiny they were almost invisible without a microscope.
  
 ﻿Wise men still can't decide whether these are masterpieces or crap, but sometimes, when the moon is full, they find them useful to bring some semblance of order. Some of them are definitely unfinished, as if he ran out of ink in his magical quill, but even in that state, they can solve the problems of poor souls who have experienced more chaos than a tavern full of drunken trolls.
  
 ﻿Finally, the psychopatchist decided to share his works with the wider public, so everyone may use them and at least tame the modding chaos a little bit. Rejoice, for the age of orderly plugins is upon us![/left]

***[font=Arial]Irrelevant knowledge:[/font]***
  
- All plugins are in ESP-FE format and packed into a FOMOD installer, making installation as easy as pushing an octopus through a keyhole – which is to say, much simpler than it sounds.
  
- It's highly possible this collection will grow or shrink, like a magical garden tended by an invisible gardener. Some patches might someday receive dedicated bigger collections, but that depends on the whims of fate and whether the Madlad can find even more time and patience to finish them.
  
- Some plugins cover only the issues I've encountered while working on different projects, therefore they aren't finished, yet still serve their purpose. It's a bit like a magical potion that doesn't turn you into a dragon, but at least stops you from sneezing.
