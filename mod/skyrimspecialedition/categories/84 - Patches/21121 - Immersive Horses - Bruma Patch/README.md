Immersive Horses - Bruma Patch
  
  
This is a patch for [Immersive Horses](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13402) and [Beyond Skyrim - Bruma SE.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10917/)﻿ Please read the description before installing or asking question in the comments. 
  
  
  
Anything important to know?
  
  
The "**Horse Breeds.json**" file included in this patch will need to **overwrite or replace**the file of the same name from **Immersive Horses**. This is necessary in order for the Bruma horse breeds and stats to be editable and show up correctly in the stats menu. 
  
  
If you are doing a **manual install** or still using **NMM**, consider making a backup copy of the **Horse Breeds.json**file from Immersive Horses **before** installing this mod. You will need that file back if you ever decide to uninstall Beyond Skyrim - Bruma and/or this patch.
  
  
  
Installation
