This is just a quick fix to be able to answer "Yes, I have."; after being asked if you have mastered the Expert Level Destruction Spells by J'zargo. Unfortunately, because of the way Ordinator handles perks, there is no Expert Level perk choice. To get around this I have added the following perks as a possible choice for the Dialogue:
  
**70 - Ancient Seals****70 - Electroconvulsions****70 - Hypothermia****70 - Scorched Earth****70 - War of the Elements****80 - Elemental Specialization -** this was added, because of the way the perks are branched (in case you pick it before any of the others)
  
  
Don't forget to endorse Ordinator by EnaiSiaion. Without his mods, the game would be boring!
