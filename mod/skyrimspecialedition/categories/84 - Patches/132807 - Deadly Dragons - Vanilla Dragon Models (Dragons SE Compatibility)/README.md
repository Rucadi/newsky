**Changes the [Deadly Dragons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23723) to appropriate vanilla dragon models so they're affected by mods such as [Dragons SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/132218).**
  
Should work for other model replacers but only Dragons SE was tested.
  
  
  
*- Deadly Dragons use appropriate vanilla dragon models to enable compatibility with Dragon model replacers (e.g. Forest Dragon = green, Magma Dragon = red, Arctic Dragon = blue)
  
- Dracolich/Bone Dragon/Mechadon models are unchanged and will use their Deadly Dragon model*Only changes dragon outfits which makes it perfectly compatible with Deadly Dragons rebalancing mods etc.
  
Compatible with the Loremonger and Regular versions of Deadly Dragons.
