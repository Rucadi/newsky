A bunch of patches for various mods to use alongside Restless Dead that I personally am currently using..
  
  
A few notes:
  
  
Ancient Nord Stalhrim requires users to have updated to 1.6+ at least once prior; this will still work even if you roll back.  The Ancient Nord Stalhrim Mace and Warhammer use textures that were included in the free official update.  
  
  
Animated Armoury requires the CC fishing patch from Restless Dead due to the new draugr weapons distributed in the level list, and both the fixes and enchantment modules from Animated [Armoury - Fixes Rebalance Enchantments - No Whips Edition](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63813) or [Animated Armoury - Fixes Rebalance Enchantments and Patches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47213) 
  
Enjoy.
