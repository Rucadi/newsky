**Addons for [Alchemy Requires Bottles Redux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44053?tab=description).**

ARBR is a very awesome mod for us hardcore immersion freaks that deserves a well-earned shoutout.

* **EMPTY BOTTLE MODEL**

This patch only adds an empty bottle model for the empty potions. Be warned: the empty potion model is far from perfect as I'm a noob. ~~Only the facing side of the model is visible, even throughout the transparency~~. **Update: ElSopa stopped by and helped out with this.**Feel free to use the model for any mod, no permission or credits needed.
  
  
  
  

  
* **HARVESTING SPIDER VENOM REQUIRES A BOTTLE**

This makes it so to harvest venom off a frostbite spider you must have an empty bottle. If you don't, you simply can't grab the venom. If you do have an empty bottle, then it will be used upon grabbing the venom. Immersion!
  
  
  
  

  
* **ITEM DESCRIPTION FOR EMPTY BOTTLES**

If you have Description Framework, bottles will have a short description.**Enjoy!**
