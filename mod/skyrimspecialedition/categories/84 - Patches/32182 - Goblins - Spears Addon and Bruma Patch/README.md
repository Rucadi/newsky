**What does this mod do?**
  
This patch has been created to offer a synergy between the Goblins Creation and Beyond Skyrim: Bruma. The additional exit offers an alternative way to enter Cyrodiil and has been created in-line with information found during the Creation's quest.
  

**BS Bruma Patch**

  
Features:
  

  
* Fully navmeshed addition to Gromm's Pass via clearable rubble giving the dungeon an exit into Cyrodiil.
Steel-Blue Entomola synergised between the Creation and Beyond Skyrim to preserve aspects of both.
  
* Adds Beyond Skyrim goblin clutter to Gromm's Pass.

  
**Spears Addon**
  
Features:
  

  
* Goblins will now weild Goblin Spears, custom texture weapons made to stylisticly match Bruma's other Goblin weapons.
The Spear of Bitter Mercy is fully functional (with automatic Storm Atronach summoning etc.) and can be obtained from Gogh, however, there are a specific set of requirements to gain Gogh's trust enough to allow it. The conditions are intended to be kept secret, please do not ask or discuss them in the comments.
  
  
* Spears will only be obtainable if [Automatic Animations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59484)﻿ or [Animated Armoury](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/35978)﻿ are installed (Basically this means they only drop if you can use them)
Automatic Animations has built in support and needs no patching, Animated Armoury requires an additional patch to allow the animations to work.
