**Joseph Russell's Writing Patches**

  
Skyrim is a fantastic way of telling stories.  This vast and deep virtual world that we're lucky enough to be able to explore is not only a source of hundreds of hours of entertainment, but also serves as a medium for those of us with little technical experience to deliver immersive stories to a massive, international audience, the like of which has never really existed before.  From Falskaar to the Wheels of Lull, we've had dozens of remarkable, exciting and even emotional experiences delivered to us for free by the community, and that's really quite amazing.  These mods are professional and sophisticated, but at times the one thing that can occasionally slip is the writing.
  
   
Typos, awkward sentences, grammar niggles, formatting inconsistencies - even entirely missing journal entries... these issues are common across what are otherwise the greatest mods on the Nexus, and personally, I find immersion can be damaged wherever they occur.  
  
   
[As a writer myself](http://www.josephrussellauthor.com), I reasoned I was in a position to do something about this, so I've had a go. 
  
   
Previously known as the "Typo Patches" on the Oldrim Nexus, this collection of patches has been ported across to SSE and updated with new improvements for the most promising content mods on the Nexus.  The patches are in various states of completion (indicated by the version number, 0.1 being barely started, 1.0 and above being, as far as I'm aware, finished), ranging from fixes to minor yet bothersome mistakes to large-scale re-writes that in my opinion improve the flow and quality of the writing while remaining true to the original, fantastic mods.  It had crossed my mind to withhold the patches until they were all finished, but then I thought it might be better to release patches that fix **some** errors rather than to release nothing at all. Do bear in mind that I do not have the facilities to test these patches beyond my own PC, so please, please remember to back up your save files before installing.

Disclaimer   
   
I am not the original author of any of the above mods that these patches improve. These patches are not supported by the original authors in any way, shape or form, and are independent mods with their own responsibilities and faults.
  
   
Installation   
   

  
1. Make sure you have the correct version of the original mod, listed in the description of the file.  I cannot guarantee my patches will be compatible with past or future versions of their corresponding mods.
Download and install the patches you want, preferably using NMM or MO.  If you want to do it manually, it should be as simple as dragging and dropping the .esp files into your "data" folder.  If you're not certain what that means, you should be using a mod manager.   
2. Sort your load order using LOOT or an equivalent.  It doesn't matter what order my patches are loaded in, so long as they are loaded **after** their corresponding original mod.
Enjoy!  Please use the bug report section to draw my attention to any typos I've missed!  There will be many, and it makes my job an awful lot easier being pointed in the right direction rather than sifting through every reference in every mod with SSEedit.     

  
Uninstallation   
   

  
1. Uninstall the patches using your mod manager, or delete the .esp files from your "data" folder.  This should safely revert any of my changes back to the original versions.  However, as a rule, uninstallation of mods mid-play-through is not supported by Skyrim, and is a practice that should be viewed with considerable caution.

  
FAQs   
   

  
* What happened to the Moonpath to Elsweyr Patch?   
  This has now been incorporated into the official mod, which as far as I'm aware is now typo free!  But do let me know if you find any issues, and I'll make a patch for it!
I found a typo!   
Fantastic!  You are now presented with a choice.  Option A is to post in the comments, on the bug reports, or in a personal message to me with the details of where you found the typo, and I'll get right onto fixing it.  Option B is to release a patch of your own!  A lot of my patches are in very early stages, as I'm a gamer first and a modder second, so I tend to patch as I play each particular mod.  If you think you can work faster than me (which you probably can without much difficulty) then I'd be delighted to include a link to your mod! 
  
* I'm working on a mod but I struggle with writing and/or editing - will you lend me a hand?   
  Almost certainly!  Drop me a PM.
