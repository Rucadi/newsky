This tiny plugin fixes the broken threesome dialog in Flower Girls. It's an esl ("Light Master") so it will not take up a countable plugin slot in your load order.
  
  
REQUIRES [THE MAIN FLOWER GIRLS MOD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5941/?tab=description)!
  
  
**Does it work in VR?**
  
I don't know for sure because I don't have VR. That said, it's a small patch that changes a couple of Dialog Topic conditionals, so it should work in VR.

NOTE: This patch is not "NSFW" and could not possibly offend anyone, but the dialog image above is suggestive, to say the least Therefore, I'm setting the adults-only flag on it, same as the Flower Girls mod itself.The Flower Girls mod itself, however, is NSFW.
