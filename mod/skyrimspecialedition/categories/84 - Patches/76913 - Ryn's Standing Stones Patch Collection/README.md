...Nah, but seriously, I meant to have this thing out a month or two ago, but well \*thousand yard stare\*. :P

[Enhanced Landscapes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18162) - CR on multiple landscape/navmesh records, disabled a few refs from one mod or the other to match together. Last checked against version 2.0.1
  
  
[Enhanced Landscapes - Marsh Pines Standalone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27367)﻿ - CR on two trees, and on cell settings for about 5 cells (which is basically just forwarding Update.esm waterflow). Last checked against version 2.1

[Fortune's Trade House](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22755) - Shifts an atronach and corpses so hopefully it won't fight the hagraven added by Ryn. Last checked against version 1.1

[Landscape and Water Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26138) - CR on 3 things and a cell settings that NO ONE CARES ABOUT because it only matters if you esm-ify Ryn's Standing Stones \*stares at ra2\* :PLast checked against version 7.0.1
  
  
Landscape patch - Forwards landscape from Ryn for LFFG, repaints some sections to make grass not stick through stuff. Not thoroughly tested, let me know if you run into problems.
  
  
[Leaps of Faith](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53074) - CR on two birds nests. Last checked against version 1.02

[s6o6t LORE - Mundus Stones](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51191)﻿ - DO NOT USE PLUGIN FROM THIS MOD. It's another overhaul just like Ryn's, so the two are effectively "pick one or the other." All this patch does it point Ryn's stones to use the meshes from Mundus Stones, and shifts/resizes/etc to fit Ryn's layout. Last checked against version 3.1
  
  
[Necrolock](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50896) - CR on a single ref which isn't needed if Necrolock was cleaned. Last checked against version 1.0

[Shadow of Meresis](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38167)﻿ - Forward Ryn's landscape. Last checked against version 1.1.75
  
  
[Skyrim Reborn - Hjaalmarch Hold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23801) - CR on navmesh, combined changes. Some of the bedrolls were also inaccessible from navmesh in Ryn's base, so tweaked so they could be accessed. Last checked against version 1.1.3
  
  
[Skyrim Reborn - Whiterun Hold](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16530) - CR on navmesh, multiple items around greywinter watch. Redid navmesh/landscape to work together, shifted necromancer's camp slightly away to fit the new aesthetic, shifted around some enemy spawns to (hopefully) prevent enemies fighitng one another. Last checked against version 1.1.7
  
  
[Skyrims Unique Treasures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5261) - Shifts one chest to be accessible with new layout. Last checked against version 4.5 but should work with 4.6

[The People of Skyrim 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22392) - RTCWG and The Way of the Dwemer. RTCWG: CR on a very large number of references, and a ton of navmesh. Reworked one entire area to have NPC and dungeon match new layout from Ryn, a couple other smaller tweaks. Way of the Dwemer: CR on a single navmesh. Last checked against version 10.2.1.7
  
  
[Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266) - CR patch, navmesh conflict. Thanks to jonado1
  
  
[Wraiths](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47808) - Shifts two spawns so they're not inside geometry. Last checked against version spooky
  
  
[Zerofrost Ultimate Armor Collection](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45145) - Shifts a couple spawns/chests to match new exterior. Last checked against version 1.
  
  
Other patches that I'm aware of: [Ryn's Official Patch Hub](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73778) should cover any incompatibilities between Ryn's mods. [Tiny But Useful Patch Hub](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62050) has patches for Convenient Bridges, Nature of the Wildlands, 3D Landscapes, The Marshlands, and Dave's Trees.
  
  
*Installation*
  
Use a mod manager/organizer to install, or drop the loose files into your Skyrim data folder.
  
Patches should have their appropriate masters set, and should be loaded after any mods which they are patching. Some of the fixes in question are on persistent objects and may require a new save.
  
  
*Compatibility*
  
I don't believe this should introduce any incompatibilities beyond anything which may be present between base mods. All moved objects should have been moved to locations which are non-overlapping. There may technically be a few combo patches which are needed (Convenient Bridges, TPOS2, and MAS come to mind).
