﻿ELFX or LUX - Myrwatch Mesh Patch

  
  
Redirects the texture sets in Myrwatch to use ELFX or Lux meshes so you don't have weird half texture lines on the floors and walls.
  
  
I didn't see this patched already. If there is one, then I'd have just downloaded that instead of messing with these texture sets.
  
  
Notice: 
  

  
* [color=#ff0000]If you have a mod altering the meshes of the College of Winterhold and those meshes overwrite either ELFX or Lux, this mod won't work.
  
This mod does not edit the Myrwatch Cell. At all.
  
- If you have issues in the cell, it is caused by whatever mods you have altering the Myrwatch Cell.
