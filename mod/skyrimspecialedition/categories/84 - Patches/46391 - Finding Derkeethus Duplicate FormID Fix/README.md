[Finding Derkeethus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19550) has a duplicate FormID. This can cause problems. DynDoLOD will warn you about this duplicate FormID and urge you to fix it. While the duplicated FormID might not actually break anything in particular for you, it shouldn't be there and the right thing to do is fix it.
  
  
This patch corrects the issue by replacing the ESP file. It was created by re-saving the original in the Creation Kit, so you can do that instead of using this mod. This is just here to save you time.
