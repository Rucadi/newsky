RMB SPIDified Forsworn Fashions adapts GolinskiRH's immersive Forsworn Fashions to use SPID for better compatibility across the board.
  
  
It introduces an assortment of outfits which are distributed in a mod-agnostic fashion, natively supporting mods such as Requiem and Madmen out-of-the-box with the power of SPID, all without the need for compatibility patches!
  
  
As always, if you have any suggestions or run into any issues, please let me know.

**•** Includes a modified .esp from the original mod, with removed vanilla edits to references for compatibility with other mods
  
**•** ESL Light Plugin (doesn't use a slot), to define the outfits
  
**•** Introduces (**5**) new outfits, and adds those outfits to Forsworn characters (one of which can be used by Generic Forsworn characters, meaning more characters may use these armours)
  
**•** Introduces 2 new outfits for Skeletal summons if you use Madmen
  
**•** Adds an additional **246** enchanted variants of the new armours introduced by Forsworn Fashions into the equipment pool
  
**•** Name/class specific outfits have a 70% chance of being added to Forsworn Characters
  
**•** A generic/mixed outfit that constitutes of much randomness has a 20% chance of being given to Forsworn characters
  
**•** Helmets have a 50% chance of being equipped
