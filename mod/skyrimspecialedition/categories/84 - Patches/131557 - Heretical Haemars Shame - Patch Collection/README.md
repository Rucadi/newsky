# Heretical Haemars Shame - Patch Collection
- Author: ChickenMike and FuzzBeed
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/131557
In what is likely [FuzzBeed](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/TheOneTrueFuzzBeed/about-me?gameId=1704) and I's last collaborative project for a bit on account of my applying for Skyblivion, we present [Heretical Haemars Shame](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/131171)﻿, a dungeon overhaul. Because Fuzz did a ground up redesign of the dungeon, any other mod that touches either of the cells will likely need a patch. Please bother me if you have an issue with my patches not the original mod authors. These patches were made by me ChickenMike and not [TheOneTrueFuzzBeed](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/52991701). All plugins are .ESL flagged .ESPs so they won't take up a place in your load order.
  
  

IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU ADD THESE PATCHES TO A NEW GAME. To quote [robertgk2017](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5544506) "Modding is illegal post character start."﻿ You might be able to get away with it if you haven't entered the cell yet but this is neither recommended nor supported. 
  
  
These patches require [BEES](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441) to function properly on older game versions.

PATCHES﻿

[Alternate Perspective - Alternate Start](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50307) - Moves a marker to ensure you spawn in the correct spot if doing the vampire start at Haemar's. 
  
  
[Amulets of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/487) - [Legacy of the Dragonborn Display patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30980) - This patch is specifically for the amulet display patch on the LOTD patch page and requires the LOTD plugin from [Amulets of Skyrim - Tweaks and Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31814). It is not needed if you are not using it. This patch moves an amulet from the void to on top of a barrel to the right of the boss chest at the end of the dungeon. 
  
  
[Locked Chests Have Keys](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74565) - Ensures the chest is in the correct location with the correct key and puts the key in the cell somewhere  Spoiler On a shelf on the left side of the stairs below the statue. [Orpheus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/128519) - Moves all of Orpheus' quest references into the new cells so the quest actually functions. This plugin is currently in a beta state. Please tell me if you have any issues. This patch 100% requires a new save and is not compatible with the Mihail Vampire Lords and Beasts patch or the Vampire Clans and Bloodlines patchalso on this page. In the event you are using the Alternate perspective patch, you have to leave the dungeon and talk to the vigilant outside in order for Orpheus's into quest to trigger correctly. I will make combo patches at some point
  
  
[Pilgrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54099) - Ensures the activator works with the moved statue
  
  
[Snazzy Furniture and Clutter Overhaul (SFCO)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2414) - Ensure an enchanting table and an alchemy table are in the correct spots with their snazzy varaiant and makes a painting visible. 
  
  
[Snazzy Furniture and Clutter Overhaul (SFCO3) - Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/113045) (specifically for the addons) - Moves a painting so that it is visible
  
  
[Tamrielic Culture](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11418) - Moves some blood barrels so that they are actually in the dungeon. 
  
  
[There is No Umbra - Chapter III](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89089) - Ensures a quest functions inside the new cell
  
  
[Vampire Clans and Bloodlines](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37517) - Swaps the generic NPCs from Fuzz's mod with the new ones from Vampire Clans and Bloodlines. This patch is not compatible with the Orpheus patch or the Mihail's Vampire Lords and Beast patch on this page. I'll do combo patches (and a fomod) at some point in January. 
  
  
[Vampire Lords and Beasts- Mihail Monsters and Animals](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/79281) - Moves Mihail's creatures into the new cell and disables some spawns so the dungeon isn't literally impossible. 
  
  
[Xelzaz](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62893) - Ensures the two mods are load order agnostic and Barbas actually appears correctly
  
  
[Wintersun - Faiths of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506) - Ensures the activator works with the moved statue
  
  

FAQ﻿

Q:Why does your thumbnails look like you just took FuzzBeed's thumbnail and threw a text box over it in PowerPoint?
  
A: I don't know how to do thumbnails and FuzzBeed said it was cool so thats I did. Also I'm lazy and you're not my dad. 
  
  
Q:Do these patches work with my game version?
  
A:as long as you use [BEES](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441) you should be fine.
  
  
Q:Wow these patches sure look complicated to do how did you make them?
  
A:Truthfully it's not that complicated. It took me like an hour to learn the like an hour to learn the CK and to be honest you should already know how to use SSEedit. Janquel's guide﻿ is an invaluable resource and without it I wouldn't have known where to even start. If I can do it you can too!
  
  
Q:FOMOD?
  
A: Its 6 plugins. no
  
  
Q:Do you take patch requests?
  
A:My primary reason for making patches is personal use but if I can make the patch quickly I'll consider it. 
  
  
Q:You haven't had any recent activity on Nexus and I need to get a hold of you, how can I do that?
  
A:@ChickenMike in either Ryn, or Janquel's discords and I should see it. I'm also in a bunch of other discords, but I check those two the most regularly.
  
  
Q:Why are you missing so many screenshots?
  
A:I'm lazy and taking screenshots is super tedious and I hate it.
