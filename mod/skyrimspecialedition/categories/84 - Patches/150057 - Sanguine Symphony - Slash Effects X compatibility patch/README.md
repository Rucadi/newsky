[/font][font=Trebuchet MS]I'm not so interested about the slash effects of Slash Effects X, but I like it's blood effect when hits. However Sanguine Symphony will override these effects, so I made this patch.
  
  
This patch revert some impactdata to [font=Trebuchet MS][size=3]Slash Effects X[/font] record, so Slash Effects X can work as expect. And the impactdata that add by Sanguine Symphony was moved to ExtraImpactData, so you can actually see the impact effect of them both at the same time.
  
  
Dynamic blood spray of Sanguine Symphony was not affected, it works as usual.
  
  
Note that this will overwrite the "Threshold" setting of Sanguine Symphony (enemy will bleed depend on their remaining health, they will not bleed if have a higher health) .With this patch , enemy will always bleed when hit. If you like bloody combat, i think you will not mind it.[/size][/font][font=Times New Roman]
