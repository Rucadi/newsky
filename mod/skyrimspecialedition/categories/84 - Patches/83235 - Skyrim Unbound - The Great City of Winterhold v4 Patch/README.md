Moves Skyrim Unbound spawn marker to match new interior.
  
  
Skyrim Unbound adds a new set of spawn points for the player, including Winterhold Inn. Great City of Winterhold entirely changes that cell by completely remaking it and moving it in the worldspace.
  
That means when you spawn there, you will spawn out of bounds, but game should in no more than a few seconds teleport you back to nearest allowed area inside the inn. So you actually don't need this patch, but if you want to spawn instantly inside the inn without any potential issues, you might want to install it. It's ESL so won't take plugin space.
