# Precision - Summermyst Patch
- Author: Ershin - EnaiSiaion
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/146169


This mod applies colored weapon trails to Summermyst enchantments that were missing one, and thus had the default white weapon trail. It's just a .toml file, so safe to install and uninstall mid-game. Compatible with all trail mesh replacers.
  
  
**The enchantments covered, along with the colors applied, are the following:**
  
  
 - Clumsy/Imprisonment/Savagery/Hex/Mania: Green
  
 - Absorb Speed/Absorb Armor/Drain Armor: Light Green
  
 - Power Surge/Primal: Bluish Green
  
 - Steal Weapons/Shifting Earth/Radius: Brown
  
 - Launch/Skyhook: Orange
  
 - Heal: Yellow
  
 - Counterspell: Blue
  
 - Slay Living/Disable Regeneration: Yellowish Green
  
 - Drain Skills: Light Orange
  
 - Blindness/Invisibility: Purple
  
 - Threshold Wail/Karma: Dark Blue
  
 - Illusory Burden/Hidden Serpent/Sound: Pink
  
 - Killstreak/Battle Hunger/Roulette: Light Red
  
 - Poison Damage: Dark Yellowish Green
  
 - Bleed Damage: Dark Red
  
 - Beaconbound/Berserking/Momentum/Insult/Might/Goldstrike: Grayish Blue
  
 - Leak Stamina: Bluish White
  
 - Balefire/Death's Door: Dark Green
  
 - Stormbringer/Rolling Thunder: Teal
  
 - Weakness to Fire/Frost/Shock/Poison: Light Bluish Purple
  
  
NOTE: since the trails are applied using effect shaders, many of which are shared across different enchantments (as you can see above), even if I forgot to list certain enchantments, they are probably covered. That said, let me know if there are ones I actually missed.
  
  
**REQUIREMENTS**
  
 - Summermyst
  
 - Precision
  
 - (if you want the trails to look like the ones from the screenshots) Precision - Enchanted Weapon Trails
  
  
**INSTALLATION**
  
Make sure to load it after Precision and Summermyst, otherwise load order doesn't matter. Since it's an SKSE plugin, you can install or uninstall it mid-playthrough with no issues.
