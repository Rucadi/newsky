A collection of patches for select mods that stop them from giving new characters Debug Spells, Powers, Books, Notes, etc.
  
  
Notes, Books and or items given by the mods on a new game are replaced with 1 gold. 
  
Spells and Powers are replaced with the Flame spell.
  
  
The items, books, notes, spells and powers are not removed from the game so you can still spawn them in with console commands when you actually need to use them.
  
  
If you cant find a patch for the mod you want then it is likely in the similar mods below, take a look.
