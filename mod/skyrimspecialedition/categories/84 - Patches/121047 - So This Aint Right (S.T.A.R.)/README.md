**So This Aint Right**
  
This is a random assortment of patches that I have made over the course of playing Modded Skyrim. A lot of these patches I have made ages ago and have never seen the light of day until today! They are all in a FOMOD and are all ESL Flagged! (Or at least they all *should* be). Some of these patches could have very well already been made somewhere else, I just never saw them. Hopefully you find something you need! Enjoy!
  
  
Below is a rough list of the patches included in this page:
  
  
**[[color=#f6b26b]Carriage Drivers Are Alive](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51260) -[/color] [Carriage and Ferry Travel Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8379) Patch**:
  
This patch gives the carriage drivers the packages from CDAA and changes the ownership of items added to the CFTO Carriage drivers and ferrymen. Now the CFTO carriage drivers and ferrymen (That have a vanilla counterpart) will feel alive!
  
  
[The Coachmen](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/91430) Patch - Tweaks some dialogue conditions, edits some packages, and edits the spid file that distributes the new packages so the drivers that have CDAA packages will use those instead of the default ones from Coachmen
