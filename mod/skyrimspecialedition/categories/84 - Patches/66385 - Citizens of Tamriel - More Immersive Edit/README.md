**Primary Features:**[/size]
  
This is a very small xEdit patch for Craftian's [Citizens of Tamriel SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29069)﻿ [[archive](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29069?tab=files&file_id=259606)﻿  <<<] to set 5 NPCs as "Initially Disabled". They are still part of the mod to avoid breaking any references. They just don't spawn, now. **If they've *already* spawned in your game, then this probably won't be very useful to you.**
  
  
**Note that there is now a [newer version called EZPG](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78663)﻿ [[archive](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78663?tab=files&file_id=536115)﻿]. This patch will *not* work with it and its features have been rolled into it (and expanded). Only use this patch if you are locked into the original CoT.** (*No longer supported by the mod author, but left here for historical purposes*)
  
  
\*\* **22APR25**: The parent mod has been removed by its author. It is no longer supported but can be downloaded via its [archive link](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29069?tab=files&file_id=259606)﻿. \*\*
  
  
This patch was created in response to a [conversation on CoT's forum](https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/7995678-citizens-of-tamriel-se/page-28#entry96212448)﻿ asking if a few of the less immersive NPCs could be a little less .. there. The NPCs are well-written, well-voiced, and even entertaining, but for people wanting a certain kind of more serious roleplay, they might break the immersion more than preferred. The 5 NPCs identified in this class are:
  
  
God-King Soul Reaver III
  
Jarl Marx
  
Master Krellyk (and his stand)
  
Nelly
  
Wuthahrkgolah
  
  
Barring any activating scripts that do something to these NPCs, you should not see them. I have done a quick teleport to each of their locations (from the locations file provided by the mod author) and didn't see any of them. I also did a similar test for a sample of the *remaining* 38 NPCs and found them all. As far as I know, this patch is working like it's supposed to, but let me know if I missed anything.
  
  
**Other NPCs:**
  
The remaining NPCs are generally seen as immersive, lore-friendly, and as an entertaining addition to the average person's play-through. However, each player has their own image of what the "perfect play-thru" looks like and, to the extent possible, this mod will add a selection of additional NPCs that can be disabled as optional plug-ins. These will be offered *à la carte,* one patch per NPC, and will be added as they are requested, built, and tested. These patches are \*NOT\* recommended unless the player has already encountered them at least once in a previous play-through and determined that, for whatever reason, they are not a fit for this one, **The existence of a patch for any NPC outside the main patch should not be construed as a suggestion that there is anything un-immersive about that NPC.** Other NPCs currently supported as optional deactivations include:
  
  
Anya
  
Malik
  
Too Bloody Relaxed (and his gear)
  
  
**Experimental Waterflow Patch**
  
Mods ported over from Oldrim (I suspect CoT is one of them) can have waterflow errors that look like straight lines in the middle of waterways. I can't dupe the error reliably, but this patch should fix it if you encounter the problem. This is completely unrelated to the other MIE plugins and really doesn't even require a specific version of CoT since it's just reverting values back to base. I went ahead and made CoT a master, though, since you don't need this if you're not running that. See the ﻿"[Fix Oldrim Mods Waterflow](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5221)﻿" Nexus page for more detail.
  
  
**Installation:**
  
Run the provided FOMOD installer with your mod manager of choice, and select the options you want. If not using a mod manager, open the archive and view the "data' subfolder". All the plug-ins are there - just grab the ones you want and put them in the game data folder.
  
  
This patch should be loaded late\last among any other patches affecting CoT, sInce anything it overwrites, it's also disabling *anyway*. This patch (and any optional patch) was saved as an ESL flagged ESP (ESPfe). It should sort like an ESP without taking up a normal ESP slot.
  
  
**Shout-outs:**
  
Craftian for building this monster. I can't even imagine how much work went into it.
  
jayserpa for pointing me towards the right place to edit.
  
  
A final note: In the conversation mentioned above, Craftian stated that he's "moved on from supporting Citizens", and [his profile](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/39079115)﻿ says that he's okay with patches. That said, this patch exists, and continues to do so, at his sufferance.
  
  
**Open Permissions:**
  
This patch is made available with full open permissions. If you want to make a better version of it, feel free to fork my work. You don't even have to credit me. And if I like yours better, I'll ~~take mine down~~ recommend it as a replacement. Whatever goes down, I'll leave this here unless I'm forced to pull it. [/left]
