# Editable Myrwatch-XelzazAE Patch

When using both Jelidity's Editable Myrwatch and Xelzaz's AE addon, the entrance into Myrwatch gets overwritten by XelzazAE and spawns the player into a blue void whenever they try to enter.
  
This patch simply fixes that by making sure the player actually spawns into Myrwatch.
