These fixes address some lingering issues with Tavern Games - Alt Camera Patch and makes the No Silent Voices patch compatible as well.
  
  
**PROBLEMS**
  
  
**Face Discoloration Bug**
  
  
When Alt Camera Patch eslified the original ESP, the formIDs for the NPC Gamblers were altered which caused the titular issue. To address this, I've provided updated facegeom and facetint files.
  
  
  
**No Silent Voices**
  
  
As it was built off of the original ESP, I've updated the espfe to match the new formIDs of the eslified plugin. This is a replacer; the original No Silent Voices is not required.
  
  
  
***Updated SEQ***Some users report that the Tavern Games version from Alt Camera Patch does not function, but that generating a new SEQ based off the eslified ESP helped. This is an experimental fix and may not work for everyone, e.g. I found that I did not require a new SEQ file. Feel free to give it a try.
