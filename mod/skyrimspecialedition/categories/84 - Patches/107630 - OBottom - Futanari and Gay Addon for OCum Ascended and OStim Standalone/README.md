[font=Tahoma]**OBottom - Futanari and Gay Addon for OCum Ascended**[/font]

  
This addon focuses on futanari and gay bottom support for OCum Ascended. Bottoms have some new titillating options when experiencing an orgasm.
  
  

**List of Features**

  
- Upon orgasm, futanari will have a chance to squirt. This is separate from them ejaculating so both can occur at once.
  
  
- Upon orgasm, bottoms will visually ejaculate so long as they are not receiving a blowjob or penetrating a partner, basically whenever their penis is free of obstruction. This feature is already partially available in base OCum but restricted. This addon will logically enable it in more types of scenes.
  
  
- Upon orgasm from sex in a cowgirl/missionary related position, bottoms will apply cum to tops' chest and potentially face. This is based off the intensity of their ejaculation as determined by the main mod.
  
  

**Installation**

Install OCum Ascended and all of its requirements.
  
  

**(Preemptive) Frequently Asked Questions**

  
***Is there any way I can adjust some settings, like the chance of squirting?***
  
Please check OCum Ascended's MCM for mod options. Those settings will affect this mod, e.g. toggling off cum shots will disable it from occurring via this addon as well.
  
  
***Will this work with scenes involving only NPCs?***
  
This addon only supports OStim scenes involving the player. NPC-NPC scenes are not affected.
  
  
***Does this work with threesomes or more?***
  
Yes, there is logic built in that supports 3+P. As mentioned, the main focus is on the orgasmer's penis and whether it's obstructed.
  
  
***Help, it's not working with this particular animation!***
  
This mod functions mainly via OStim's tagging system. Some of the animations in SexLab conversion packs are missing proper tags due to machine automation so they just aren't being recognized. If/when those mods get updated with tags, things should immediately start working. Alternatively, you can adjust the tags yourself if knowledgeable.
