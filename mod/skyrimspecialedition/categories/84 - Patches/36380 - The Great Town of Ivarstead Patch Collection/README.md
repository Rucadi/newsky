Continuing with my series of "I want to run with unique architecture everywhere, but that requires SO MANY compatibility patches" series... Ivarstead! Archinatic put together a lovely little overhaul of Ivarstead in his [The Great Town of Ivarstead](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34505)﻿, and I've put together a series of compatibility patches for things in my load order which needed it. All patches are ESP flagged as ESL, unless otherwise noted.

[AI Overhaul SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21654) - shifts some placed idle markers to match the new interior/exteriors. Made for 1.5.3, should be good through 1.8.6.

[Distinct Interiors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6130) - Patch here was just disabling Distinct Interiors. Removed from FOMOD and put into Old Files section for posterity. Use Czasior's patch [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46021) instead.
  
  
[DK's Realistic Nord Ships](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43407) - adjusts the barrels placement, navmesh rework. Last checked against version 2.0

[Enhanced Landscapes - Mountains and Cliffs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/75311) - Disables and modifies placement of rocks additions to not clip with the ruined house. Last checked against version 1.0.2
  
  
[Enhanced Lights and FX](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2424) ﻿- Forwards any conflicts having Great Town of Ivarstead win, shifted any added smoke to match the new interiors, and shifted door lights where appropriate. Provided separate patch for ELFX - Exeriors as well. Last checked against version 3.06.
  
  
[Embers HD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14368) - Shifts the placement of the fire for Embers to match the new interior of the Vilemyr Inn. Last checked against version 1.3998.
  
  
[Embers XD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37085) - Shifts the placement of fires to better utilize the new look of Embers XD, includes some ashes spread around, and in a few places substitutes
  
fire types to better match aesthetics. Last checked against version 3.0.8
  
  
[ezPG](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78663) - moves NPC and markers out of the void, conflict resolution on a chair. Patch based on FULL variant of ezPG, probably won't work with other variants (for sure incompatible with ones without Mythos addon). Last checked against version 2.5
  
  
[Farmhouse Chimneys](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8766) - disables all chimneys in Ivarstead. Last checked against version 4.2.1
  
  
[Gods and Worship](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45011) - conflict resolution on a few records. Last checked against version 2.3
  
  
[Gourmet - Tables](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/96876) - Adjusts the placement of the cooking pot in Vilemyr Inn. Last checked against version 1.1.12
  
  
[Holidays](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1533) - shifts a bunch of references to match the modified city layout. Last checked against version 2.14
  
  
[Immersive Citizens - AI Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/173) - forwards ICAIO ownership/persistence changes and adapts the markers placement in Vilemyr Inn. Last checked against version 0.4.0.2
  
  
[Immersive Wenches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/595) - moves a couple of idle markers to match the new interiors. Last checked against version 1.60SE
  
  
[Interesting NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194) - Re-upload of ShadowOfNV's patch from [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34535) (make sure to click the link and endorse!) with the proper v1.1 fix because I had xEdit open when saving the patch and the uploaded version there is missing a bedroll fix. I had a link to it in the comments for a while now, but since it hasn't been updated, I'm putting it here for now. If requested, or if the original page updates, I'll remove this one from here, I just didn't want anyone to miss the latest update. Last checked against version 4.53
  
  
[JK's Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6289) - Update to existing JK's Skyrim patch, to alter the added building to match the Great Town of Ivarstead aesthetic. ESP and ESL version provided. I recommend using the ESL version unless on an existing save, in which case I *think* you should be able to update using the ESP version (and existing bashed/smashed patches should definitely work on the ESP version if on a new save). Last checked against version 1.7.
  
  
[Kaidan 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19075) - Hooks up navmesh properly for Kaidan 2's changes outside town. Patches for with/without JKs. LOTD users will probably want to open up the CK and finalize things themselves with this, as well, but we're getting to the point where we'd need 6 patches to cover every case and it'd scale from there. Last checked against version 2.1.1
  
  
[Keep it Clean](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17846) - Shifts the trapdoor to match new interior, ties into new navmesh. Last checked against version 3.15a
  
  
[Knights of Thorn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50379) - Shifts notes in Vilemyr Inn. Last checked against version 1.00
  
  
[Landscape and Water Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26138) - Conflict resolution for records touched by both mods, forwarding ownership changes. Last checked against version 5.3
  
  
Landscape Grass Patch - No link for this one, specifically. The Great Town of Ivarstead repaints some of the landscape in such a way that some grass mods (I use [Verdant](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2296) in the screenshots) throw grass ALL OVER the place. This patch attempts to ape what [Landscape Fixes for Grass Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9005) does so elegantly by re-doing the painting of the landscape in such a way that the grass isn't overwhelming. From my testing, this is NOT needed if you're using the JK's Patch. Still including this one since the LFFG Patch isn't updated for the new Ivarstead yet.
  
  
[Lanterns of Skyrim II](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30817) ﻿- Two patches available - one with, and one without JKs. If you're using JKs, you will still need the Lanterns of Skyrim II - JKs patch. You should only be using ONE of these patches, however - all the base changes are included in the JKs one. Last checked against version 4.0.
  
  
[Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802) ﻿- Moves one placed gem and a drunk idle marker. No transport crates or fliers in the Vilemyr Inn. Go fig. Last checked against 6.7.1
  
  
[Mihail Haystacks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/125021) - Adjusts haystacks placement. Last checked against version 1
  
  
[Mirai - The Girl with the Dragon Heart](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10908) - Shifts a sitting idle marker on the High Hrothgar bridge to match the new bridge layout. Last checked against version 2.11
  
  
[More to Say](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22622) - forwards persistence on a few references. Last checked against version 8.0.3
  
  
[Mythos](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51576) - moves NPC and markers out of the void, conflict resolution on a chair.  Last checked against version Redux
  
  
[Nature of the Wild Lands](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63604) - conflict resolution on two records. Last checked against version 3.05
  
  
[Notice Board](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3218) - modifies the placement of the boards and markers to match the modified town layout. Last checked against version 1.4
  
  
[Off Limits](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71109) - adjusts the activator bounds in Vilemyr Inn. Last checked against version 2.2
  
  
[Populated Skyrim HELL Edition](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5017) - shifts markers to match the new interiors/exteriors. Last checked against version 4.0. Thanks to Cecell for the patch
  
  
[Populated Cities and Towns](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2005) - shifts markers to match the new interiors/exteriors. Last checked against version 4.1.
  
  
[Radiance - Locations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45419) - conflict resolution on the chest, shifts ledger position. Last checked against version 1.0.1
  
  
[Realistic Water Two](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2182) - forwards RW2 water settings, probably not needed if you load RW2 after TGT Ivarstead. Last checked against version 5.7.2
  
  
Redguard Elite Armaments - CC patch which shifts a lean marker to match the new exterior (and something to lean on).
  
  
[Relics of Hyrule](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12244) - shifts a note and a book. Last checked against version 6.6.3.4
  
  
[Requiem](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60888) - adapts placement of the added food to new interiors, conflict resolution on a few records. Last checked against 5.4.5
  
  
[Second Great War](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17204) - Shifts the placement of a few NPCs to not spawn inside the buildings and out of navmesh, adapts placement of three markers. Last checked against version 1.10

[Skyrim Belongs to the Nords](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19788) - adjusts a bunch of markers and NPCs, conflict resolution. Bear in mind that the original mod contains deleted navmeshes, which might lead to CTDs. Last checked against version 1.1

*Installation*
  
Use a mod manager/organizer to install, or drop the loose files into your Skyrim data folder.
  
Patches should have their appropriate masters set and should be loaded after any mods that they are patching. Some of the fixes in question are on persistent objects and may require a new save.
  
  
*Compatibility*
  
I don't believe this should introduce any incompatibilities beyond anything which may be present between base mods. All moved objects should have been moved to locations which are non-overlapping. Let me know if you hit anything
