The Gray Cowl of Nocturnal has a Notice Board in Ben Erai that contains four (five in the 10th Anniversary version) pre-set miscellaneous quest-starting notes. Missives - Worldspace Additions adds a Missive Board to Ben Erai that generates infinite radiant quests.
  
  
  
Some - and, admittedly, myself - felt having two boards seemed odd and unnecessary. So read on if you feel the same.
  
  
  
This will take the four/five quest-starting notes from the Gray Cowl of Nocturnal's Notice Board, remove said Notice Board, and place the notes on the Missive Board instead.
  
  
  
The catch is that these notes are placed via quest aliases, and the quests controlling them are "start game enabled", which means this patch will only move them to the Missive Board if you haven't already started a save with The Grey Cowl of Nocturnal installed.
  
  
  
However, if you just want the Notice Board gone, it shouldn't be a problem to install this on an ongoing save, just make sure you've already taken the notes from the Notice Board before installing this patch if you want to do those miscellaneous quests.
  
  
  
I've also renamed the notes to better match Missives' conventions.

Flagged as ESL.
  
  
  
I tested this on a fresh save and spent many in-game months letting the Missive Board refresh multiple times, and the four Notice Board notes stayed on the Missive Board after every refresh. I feel I can confidently say it will work no matter your Missives respawn settings, but feel free to let me know if you have any issues. I do have an alternative - albeit less elegant - solution in mind if the respawns ever cause problems.
