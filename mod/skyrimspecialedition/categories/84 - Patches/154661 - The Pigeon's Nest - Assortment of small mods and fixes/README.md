INTRODUCTION[/font]**

  
An assortment of patches, fixes and small mods that I've made (and currently making) that don't require their specific page. Most of the patches and fixes I made while playing [Gate to Sovngarde](https://www.nexusmods.com/games/skyrimspecialedition/collections/qdurkx) collection.
  
  
  

**[font=Georgia]CONTENTS[/font]**

  
**Quality of Life:**
  
  
**Gather Branches:** A tweak for Skills of the Wild mod so you can scavenge resources to start a fire early on.
  
When first placing a campfire, you'll receive the "Gather Branches" ability. With this ability, you can spend 30 minutes gathering branches to start the fire. In Realistic Mode, you can start a small fire with three branches. After you unlock the "Lumberjack" perk, the ability will be upgraded to the "Harvest Wood" ability.
  
  
This is only useful if using the Realistic Mode from Campfire.
  
Requires: [Skills of the Wild - New Campfire Survival Skill Trees](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37693).
  
  
**Climbable ladders for Hendraheim:** Replaces the ladders from Hendraheim Tweaks and Enhancements with climbable ladders from EVG Animated Traversal. P.S.: NPCs can also use the ladders.
  
  
Requires: [EVG Animated Traversal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63232) and [CC Hendraheim - Tweaks and Enhancements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98688)
  
  
**Dynamic Race Based Lich:** Adds new models for Argonian, Khajiit, Elf, and Orc Lichs. The appropriate model is dynamically applied when your character transforms into a Lich, based on their race.
  
  
Custom races can be patched by adding their race records to the following Formlists:

Requires: [Wounds](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17581) and [Immersive Equipment Displays](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62001)
  
  
**Train Hand to Hand on Dummies:** Allows you to train Hand to Hand (Adamant addon) on training dummies from Dynamic Things Alternative mod.
  
  
Requires: [Hand to Hand - An Adamant Addon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59790) and [Dynamic Things Alternative - Base Object Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60741)
  
  
**Ultimate Animated Potion Models:** Adds potion models from [Project AHO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15996) and [Undeath Remastered](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6180) to the Animations from Ultimate Animated Potions NG.
  
  
Requires: [Ultimate Animated Potions NG](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97674) and the other two mods.
  
  
**Patches:**
  
  
Some patches for some mods.
  
  
**Pristine Vanilla Movement Sneak Camera Snap:** Adds missing Camera3d[Cam3] node to the walk and run animations (only forward for now), to fix the camera snap when entering or exiting sneak state.
  
Requires: [Pristine Vanilla Movement](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66635)
  
  
  
**HearthFires:**
  
  
HearthFires includes a system for adoption and marriage that supports up to 20 custom home slots, 9 of which are used by house mods from the Anniversary Edition Upgrade DLC. The files below patch additional house mods to use this system, allowing you to move your family in via dialogue options.
  
  
P.S.: I'm not sure about paid house mods (or any other mod in Nexus), they might conflict if using the same slots.
  
P.S. 2: This is probably redundant, unnecessary and incompatible with: [Hearthfire multiple adoptions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3862).
  
  
**Bluesky Hall:** Adds Bluesky Hall from Capital Whiterun Expansion to the vanilla adoption and marriage system, via dialogue.
  
  
You can adopt up to two children and move your family to Bluesky Hall.
  
Requires: [Capital Whiterun Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37982)
  
  
**Fort Valus:** Adds Fort Valus from Wyrmstooth to the vanilla adoption and marriage system, via dialogue.
  
  
You can adopt up to two children and move your family to Fort Valus (do not use it with the optional file for multiple adoptions, provided by Wyrmstooth mod).
  
Requires: [Wyrmstooth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45565)
  
  
**Aretino Residence:** Adds Aretino Residence from Restoring the Aretino Residence to the vanilla adoption and marriage system, via dialogue.
  
  
You can adopt up to two children and move your family to Aretino Residence. You can technically have four children there if you adopt Aretino and Sofie with the custom mechanic provided by the mod, but there won't be enough beds lol.
  
  
Requires: [Restoring the Aretino Residence](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30447)
  
  
**Interesting NPCs:**Interesting NPCs can now move to the Creation Club houses: Bloodchill Cavern, Dead Man's Dread, Gallows Hall, Goldenhills Plantation, Hendraheim, Myrwatch, Nchuanthumz, Shadowfoot Sanctum, Tundra Homestead and even Bluesky Hall, Fort Valus and/or Aretino Residence if using the mods above.
  
  
P.S.: Currently only [Isobel](https://3dnpc.fandom.com/wiki/Isobel) is patched.
  
  
Requires: [Interesting NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29194)
  
  
  
**Fixes:**
  
  
Some fixes for some vanilla bugs, you should only use them if you're experiencing the issues mentioned below.
  
  
**World Encounter Aggresion:** My personal take on the "World Encounter Hostility Fix", which doesn't use OnMagicEffectApply events, that can cause stack dumps (script lag) when using a lot of mods with cloak effects.
  
  
In the vanilla game, NPCs from World Encounters (Talsgar, some Thalmor, Guards at Solitude during Roggvir's execution, etc..) attack the player if using certain cloak effects or healing spells on them.
  
  
Requires: Skyrim Script Extender.
  
  
**Word Wall:** Fixes a somewhat rare bug that can occur due to script lag or the way trigger boxes function in the game. Sometimes, when approaching a Word Wall, it begins to glow and emit sound effects, but your character is unable to learn the word, requiring you to leave the area and return to retrigger the scripts.
  
  
**Catapults firing non-stop:** Fixes a somewhat rare bug caused by script lag during Civil War siege battles, where catapults can become stuck and continue bombarding the city endlessly, even after the battle has ended.
  
  
**Numbers Job Legder:** Fixes a somewhat rare bug that prevents the game from filling the Ledger alias during the Thieves Guild 'Numbers Job' quest, making it impossible to progress because the ledger cannot be activated by the player.
  
  
**WIDeadBodyCleanupScript:** A tweaked version of [WIDeadBodyCleanupScript Crash Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62413) mod from wSkeever. For some reason, I was experiencing some freezes after an important NPC was cleaned up by the script, calling "ResetInventory" function seems to have fixed it, so I've included that function in the script. Credits to original author.
  
  
Requires: [ConsoleUtilSSE NG](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76649)
  
  
**Apocrypha Exit Bug Fix:** Fixes (or at least tries to) a somewhat rare bug that prevents you from leaving Apocrypha. ("You are unable to concentrate on what you're reading").
