~~**Disable USSEP Unwanted Effects Book**
  
From Umgak and Phoenix's original mod page:~~
> ~~﻿So the [Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266)﻿ includes a script that you can use to remove any stuck magic effects from your character. Over the years it was available from a shrine in Kynareth's temple, then a book added to your inventory, and finally in a recent update the book was placed in Kynareth's temple. Because it offends my sense of immersion to have a book called "USSEP Unwanted Magic Effects Remover" hanging out in Whiterun, I flagged it as disabled in this plugin. Begone, killer of immersion.

> If you DO find yourself needing the book:~~
>
>   
> * ~~Open the console, type help ussep and press ENTER.~~
> ~~The book will show up at the top of the OTHER FORMS list, you need the item ID (eight characters).~~
>   
> * ~~Type in player.additem xx0B1958 1 (first two characters depend on your load order, that's why you need the exact item ID).~~
> ~~Press ENTER and one copy of the book will be added to your inventory where you can use it.~~
>   
> * ~~If you don't need it anymore, dump it in Sovngarde or something.~~

**NOTE: Phoenix has updated the patch on their page. Go there instead.**
  
  
~~**Why Do I need this?**
  
In version 4.3.6c of the Unofficial Patch, the following change was made:~~
> ~~**USSEP Fixes**~~
>
>   
> * ~~﻿The Unwanted Effects Remover book has been **de-injected** to prevent it from being removed from the game by other mods since this book is the only method available to activate the removal script.~~

~~This causes a reference error for anyone who was previously using the plugin from [Umgak and Phoenix's patch page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26092). If Phoenix or Umgak would like to take this and re-host it on their patch page, they are free to do so. 
  
  
If you are on a previous/older version of the Unofficial Patch (e.g., 4.3.0a), then you should use [Umgak and Phoenix's original version of this edit](https://www.nexusmods.com/Core/Libs/Common/Widgets/DownloadPopUp?id=228551&game_id=1704).~~
  
  
**Expanded Version**
  
The other file on this page will remove the Bitterwich book added by USSEP to Northwind Mine *and* the Debug book from the Temple of Kynareth. This plugin is named the same as the other plugin, so only one of the two files is needed.
