When overhauling weathers, you touch "Region" records.
  
  
Those also contain ambient sound records, that audio overhauls touch; making weather mods incompatible with other sound overhauls.
  
  
The following patches makes the sound overhauls co-exist with the new region settings.
  
  
The following patches are available:
  
- NAT III - SoS
  
- NAT III - AoS
  
- NAT III - SoS - AoS
  
  
If you use both AoS and SoS; you ONLY need the merged plugin.
  
  
ESP flagged as ESL, as always.
