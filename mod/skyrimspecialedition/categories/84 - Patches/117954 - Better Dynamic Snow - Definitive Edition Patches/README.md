**[font=Comic Sans MS]These are some patches i created for [Better Dynamic Snow - Definitive Edition](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/112386) that i use in my own game.
  
Maybe others have use for these.
  
Patches are tested WITHOUT [Auto Parallax](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/79473) active. So they work as intended.
  
But still, i advice to use [Auto Parallax](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/79473) to avoid parallax headaches!
  
  
  
BDS-DE - Shader Fix
  
This plugin sets "Single Pass" to true. This to fix meshes to landscapes seams.
  
 [Auto Parallax](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/79473) is a hard requirement for this plugin.
  
  
[Faction - Pit Fighter](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22513)
  
This fixes an instant CTD when entering the Windhelm Arena.
  
  
[No Snow Under the Roof](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/518)
  
When using both mods together your farmhouses will look like showed in the screenshots.
  
  
[Icy Windhelm](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55329)
  
This patch will make sure that the mod [Footprints](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3808) works within the city walls.
  
  
[The Citadel of Snow - Lively Windhelm Bridge](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/103917)
  
This patch gets the "Single Pass Color" from MATO "SnowMaterialObject1P\_livelyW" to 255/255/255,
  
so it matches the "Single Pass Color" from BDS-DE.

Just install with favorite mod manager. But obviously.. Place the patches under the required files.**[/font]

  
ENJOY!!![/size][/font][/b][/center]
