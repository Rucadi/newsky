I searched far and wide but couldn't find a [USSEP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266) patch for [JK's Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6289) yet, so I made one. There wasn't much to fix, mainly swapping some snowberries and thickets for snowy/non-snowy models (pretty noticeable in Winterhold at least). Also fixed one load door model in Dragonbridge and reapplied some ownership changes.
