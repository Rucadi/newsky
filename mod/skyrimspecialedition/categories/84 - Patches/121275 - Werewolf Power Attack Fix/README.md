I think almost everyone who has tried to play as a werewolf in Skyrim has run into this bug. It's a little funny at first, but extremely overpowered and makes playing as one get old extremely fast. Below is a video showcasing the bug if you are unaware of it. In the video you can see I am spamming power attacks at a ridiculous speed.
  
  
  
  
And now is a video of me spamming power attacks after installing this mod.
  
  
  
  
The fix is extremely simple. All it does is add a condition to the werewolf power attack record, IsSubjectPowerAttacking = 0. Now you can no longer animation cancel your werewolf power attacks with another power attack. The fix is compatible with all werewolf overhauls.
