? **Big Lean Energy – HSF Male Furniture Animation Pack**
  
You know that guy at the tavern who’s leaning on a wall like it owes him money? Or the one half-slouched on a bar stool like the protagonist of a moody ballad? Yeah—this pack lets your NPCs be that guy. Randomly. Frequently. With absolutely zero regard for subtlety.
  
  
✨ **What’s Inside:**
  

  
* ? **Bar Stool Animations (x5)** – For when sitting down is a statement.
? **Wall Lean Animations (x4)** – Includes 2 standing leans and 2 sit-like-you-own-the-place variation (funny when Maul force greets you from the floor)
  
* ? **Rail Lean Animations (x3)** – Stare off into the middle distance like you’re emotionally unavailable

? All animations are randomly selected via DAR/OAR and applied *to males only* by default.
  
? If you want it to apply to female NPCs as well just change the IsFemale() FALSE condition in the \_conditions.txt file
  
  
?️ **Compatibility:**Compatible with other swagger mods, so your world can be full of sultry leaners, ambient edge-lords, and stool philosophers. I strongly recommend having [these](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/94030) as well, it'll give you even more variety.
  
  
? **Notes**
  

  
* It's been sitting in the WIP vault (a random desktop folder I dump junk I half started) so long it gained sentience. Honestly, if I don't publish it now then I never will, life got kinda busy.
There are some missing transition anims. No, the missing transitions won't break your game. Your NPCs might slam straight into a chill bar stool animation with all the finesse of a baked potato though. It won’t break your game, but it might break your immersion. Just squint and pretend it was a power move.
  
* Some NPCs might hit these poses in weird places. Feel free to edit the DAR/OAR config.

?‍♂️ **Use case:**
  
Perfect for brooding mages, smug bards, and that one town guard who *knows* he looks good in his armor. Looking at you, Jesper.
