﻿﻿**Death Animations from Underdog Animations**

  
This mod uses the death animations from the mod [UNDERDOG - Animations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51811) and reorganize them using [Open Animation Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92109) replacing the classic spinning death animations that play when an NPC or the player is killed.
