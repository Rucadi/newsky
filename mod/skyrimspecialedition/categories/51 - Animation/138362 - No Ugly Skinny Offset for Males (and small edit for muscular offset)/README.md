[size=4]I don't know if there is already a fix for this, but I couldn't find it.
  
This has been annoying me for a very long time and I can finally fix it.
  
  
I think some clarification needs to be made here.
  
The character's weight varies from 0 to 100, and to ensure that the animations correspond to the weight, the game uses offset. Standard offset involves a very strange hand position, which causes a "twink" pose, regardless of the animations you use.
  
So this mod is compatible with everything and fixes the problem

Added optional edit for muscular offset too
  
(Screenshots shows vanilla animations. In case someone still thinks that I'm making up fixes for non-existent problems)

This is not a mod that does me much credit, but I have few more!
