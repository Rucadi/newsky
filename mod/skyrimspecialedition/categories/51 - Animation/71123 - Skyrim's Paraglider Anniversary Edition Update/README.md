This is just an updated .dll file for [Skyrim's Paraglider](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53256) for Skyrim SE 1.6.629+ (Anniversary Edition).
  
It's only the .dll file, you still need the original mod installed for it to work.
  
  
I don't have anything else to put in the description here!
  
It is literally just one updated file. If you're not on 1.6 (AE) or later, you don't even have a reason to download it!
