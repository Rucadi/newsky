**[LEGENDARY version can be found here!](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/103609)﻿ Thank you Xtudo!**
  
  
I always loved the animation used by Arch Curate Vyrthur as he's sitting on his throne. It's a nice balance between imposing and relaxed, and doesn't look as goofy as the default Jarl sitting animation to me. Therefore, I used [Bethesda Archive Extractor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/974/) to extract the animation from the BSA, and then replace it by renaming it. Very simple.
  
**FEATURES**
  
All 3 animations are randomized thanks to Open Animation Replacer, each with a 25% chance of playing. If none of them gets chosen, vanilla animation will be played instead.

**INSTALLATION**
  

  
* Install [Open Animation Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92109?tab=description)﻿ and all its requirements
Install my mod with your preferred mod manager
  
* To make it player-only, [you need to enable this condition within the OAR menu](https://i.imgur.com/cHHGGcX.mp4)﻿ for all three animations.
You can tweak the other settings too, if you want. Consult OAR's mod page for more information
  

***Optional Files***
  
The following files do not require OAR
  

  
* **Gender Specific:** Choose between replacing it only for**Male** characters or**Female** characters. **Affects all NPCs of the chosen gender.**REQUIRES[Fores New Idles in Skyrim SE - FNIS SE](http://)**﻿ or [Nemesis](https://github.com/ShikyoKira/Project-New-Reign---Nemesis-Main/releases).** Remember to check and run GENDER Specific Animations in patcher.
**Vanilla:** Simple default replacer
  

  
***Old Files***The following are legacy files that will not receive any support, but I keep them up for people who may want to use them.
  

  
* **Player-Only:**Replaces the animation only for the player with one of the 3 selection. Not randomized.
**MFSAO:** Randomized all 3 animations with DAR, made for use with older DAR versions of [Modern Female Sitting Animations Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85599)
  
* **NPC AR:**Randomized all 3 animations with DAR, made for use with [NPC Animation Remix (DAR)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63471)
**Randomized:** The original DAR version of this mod.**﻿**
  
**COMPATIBILITY**
  

  
* [Feminine Jarl Sitting Animation SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20053) -- COMPATIBLE, unless you're using Gender Specific files here.
[Pretty Sit Idles](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10399) -- COMPATIBLE, unless you're using Gender Specific files here.
  
* [Modern Female Sitting Animations Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85599) -- COMPATIBLE, but their cell-specific throne animation will take priority over mine
[NPC Animation Remix (DAR)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63471) -- SEMI-COMPATIBLE, as NPC AR adds its own modified Jarl sitting animation based on vanilla ones. However, since they use DAR, my mod will take priority. The rest of their mod will still work, since it covers way more.﻿
  

  
**KNOWN ISSUES**
  
These animations aren't mine, so I won't be making any modifications to them specifically. You, however, are free to do so, as long as it follows Bethesda's own guidelines.

  
* Arms may look floaty because the Jarl's chairs don't exactly have high arms. This affects even the normal Jarl animation.
With Animation 01, some minor clipping may occur on certain chairs, such as Windhelm's Palace of the Kings throne.
  
* The start up animation will show the character using the default Jarl pose, but immediately switching after they're fully sitting.

  
**CREDITS**
  

  
* Bethesda for making these animations. I don't own any of it.
