**Devour**
  
Devour adds the option to feed on the partner during OStim scenes for vampires, and only for vampires. New feeding animations were created for this purpose.
  
Do you want to sate your thirst in a more sensual way? Do you want everybody's favorite vampire girlfriend to take a bite on your neck?
  
Then this mod is for you!
  
  
***Drink your victim dry***
  
You can configure Devour so that the victim has a limited supply of blood. You may kill the victim by drinking it all!
  
Some overhauls have extra features on this event that will get triggered by this. The MCM has an option to enable this feature.

**Requirements & Installation**

  
1. You need OStim NG and its requirements (including the compatible version of OSA). [Follow the OStim NG installation guide](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/4550)﻿.
  
2. You need [Open Animations RE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61167)﻿, any version equal or greater to v0.36.1-DEVOUR.
  
3. You need [Vampire Feed Proxy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72911?tab=files)﻿.
  
  

**How to use**

  
1. Be a vampire or have a vampire partner.
  
2. Start an OStim scene, this can be through addons like *ORomance*or *OPrivacy.*
  
3. If the mod was installed correctly, in the "Standing" initial idle you will see a navigation option to feed on your partner.
  
4. It is strongly recommended you disable actors fully stripping at the start of animations. You may also want to hide the stimulation bars, if you do, do not enable "Autohide bars" as this will make bars appear.
  
  

**Open Animations RE forward compatibility**

  
Devour utilizes the bite animations added in Open Animations RE version v0.36.1-DEVOUR. As of now the only available bite options are on the intro scene, but when Open Animations RE adds further bite animations in the future they will automatically be supported without needing to update Devour.
