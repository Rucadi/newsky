# Feminize - Crafting Animation

**UPDATE: There seems to be some issues with Camera mods and the animations causing the player character to have the wrong camera positions. After trouble shooting, I think the problem may be due to the rig I use currently not having a Camera node. Not sure if this is fixable so I've uploaded a version that restricts these animations to NPCs only.**
  
  
Second mod in the Feminize series! 
  
  
Female Crafting Animations!!
  
  
Look, I get that blacksmithing is tough. It probably takes a lot of stamina and you have to put your back into it. But that's no excuse to look like a roided-up chimp while doing it! Similar to my [Turning Animations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72738) mod, these animations seek to bring a little more finesse and consistency to vanilla animations!![](https://i.ibb.co/0md2Rbk/Crafting.gif)
  
*Disclaimer: I only tested these animations on my already very buggy, 1300 mod game, and I did get a few small visual glitches, but I am not sure if these were already in my game or there's something wrong with the animations. It might be nothing, but if something looks odd, let me know and I will try to fix it.*
  
  
Requirements:
  
DAR - A few people asked why I use DAR instead of just replacing the vanilla animations directly, it's mainly because I'm used to using DAR, and it has the benefit of not having to run Nemesis (Or FNIS). I might in the future make a direct replacer version, or you can do it yourself since it should be very easy to do. 
  
  
Planned:
  
Various Idle animations, including Behind the Counter animations, browsing goods, thinking, reading, and more.
