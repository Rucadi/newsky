This mod replaces the forward and the side directions for the female walk animation.
  
  
I wasn't originally planning to release this, I made it exaggerated to better spot and correct unnatural movement for my wip animation project (for light armor characters as opposed to "Leviathan Animations" which focuses on heavy armors/heavy weapons), so the end result will be part of [another mod](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plDDTCK94Es) that is more grounded, nevertheless, someone asked me to upload this as it is before I overwrote it, if you find it to your liking, then I'm happy for you!
