A mod that adds leaning to horse riders through behaviour and a SKSE plugin.
  
  
Optionally adds leaning to horses as well as minor pose correction through a Pandora Engine patch.
  
  
Can configure angle, limits, and interpolation speed through the ini file.

Compatible with all animations.
  
  
With Riding Animation Overhaul, the leaning gets reversed because of the bone transforms, so the lean **multiplier** values in the ini need to be sign flipped (positive turns to negative and vice versa).

Big thanks to Ersh for his open source mods and his reverse engineering for the havok system. This mod would not be possible without the work he put in.
