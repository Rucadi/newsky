Replaces the player's woodcutting animation for a DAR animation that is 75% faster.
  
  
**Can I get firewood faster by just using this animation?**
  
Yes.
  
  
**Any incompatibilities?**
  
Probably not.
  
  
**Is it safe to enable or remove mid-game?**
  
It's just an animation replacer, so yes.
  
  
**Are you going to release a slower version?**
  
No. Animations aren't really my thing. If you really want more options, consider downloading [Customizable Faster Woodcutting Animation - DAR](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73857) instead.
