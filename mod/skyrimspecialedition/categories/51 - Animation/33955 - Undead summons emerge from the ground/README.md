**Description:**A simple animation replacer to make all undead emerge from the ground when summoned.
  
(provided they use the special\_summon.hkx animation file inside the “draugr” folder which I think are most skeleton/draugr etc. summons)
  
  
  
Video by Jebbalon (thank you)
  
  
Summoned undead creatures dont always play the "special\_summon.hkx" animation when summoned so sometimes they might still just appear normally although very rarely.

Most of the time﻿ they should emerge from the ground as seen in the pictures and video.
  
  
  
OPTIONAL FILE:
  
  
Simply replaces the summon bubble with another effect.
  
Many of you requested this but as I said before, you probably will see the skeletons body fall into the ground before it emerges again.

[font=Times New Roman]﻿This happened with the bubble aswell but you rarely saw it because the bubble was kinda hiding it.
  
THIS WILL REPLACE THE BUBBLE FOR ALL SUMMONS!
