[**Skyrim's Paraglider**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53256) is one of if not the best flight mod on the Nexus. Three years after its release, [**Skyrim's Paraglider - ZERO**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/133280) stepped up to finally fix all of its inconvenient bugs/features while also offering the leanest version ever released for maximum mod list compatibility. Now, fueled by the grateful responses received from those who experienced ZERO/ZERO+, allow me to introduce you to

  
  
  

***Skyrim's Paraglider -* ONE**﻿

The ultimate all in ONE gliding experience.

  

Find yourself wanting to use either [Skyrim's Enchanted Witch Broom](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77658) or [Levitation - A Paraglider Add-On](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93398) but can't decide between them? Or do you prefer [Telvanni Paragliding](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/119472)﻿ but wish you didn't have to completely sacrifice [Skyrim's Paraglider](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53256) to use it? We're so indecisive sometimes! Why can't we just use them all?
  
  
With ***Skyrim's Paraglider -* ONE** we can!
  
  
The decision is no more. Once we have obtained the Paraglider, exchanging it for the Enchanted Broom is as simple as clicking the Paraglider in our inventory. Prefer the Sky Lantern instead? Click again! Only Levitation can tickle your tail? Clickity milk drinking clack, ONE has got our back! Cycle through it weekly, daily, hourly, by the minute or even the second. The choice is ours.
  
  
In ONE 3.0, there are now 4 exchangeable variants for each glider, for a total of 16 gliders. We can also glide using any staff thanks to the newly implemented [Frieren - Staff Paraglider Animations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/105537). That's some **choice** gliding.﻿
  
  
*But wait! There's more!!*How exhausting is it to read? I'm not sure about you, but I only read on the toilet. Endorse/kudos if you're reading on it now. Guess what I don't do on the toilet? That's right; play Skyrim. Screw reading that one Spell Tome in particular! ONE ensures that Tarhiel's Gale is intuitively discovered the moment we obtain the Paraglider. It's not rocket science; It's wind. ?‍♂️
  
  
*Speaking of...*Remember that time we were gliding to Swindler's Den to help our girl Saadia but fell short as our Dragonborn forgot how to catch air just because we didn't *unimmersively* equip Tarhiel's Gale? To Oblivion with that! With ONE, if we're gliding, a new gale, Kyne's Wind is equipped. Period.
  
  
*Are you not entertained?!*Then perhaps a tall glass of realism/balance will quench your thirst! Utilizing real world data, ONE implements a realistic stamina usage system. New players will experience a max flight time of 20 seconds. With increased stamina will come increased flight time. However, stamina consumption only pertains to the Paraglider and Sky Lantern.
  
  
*"Cool, but why doesn't the Enchanted Broom or Levitation Gem consume stamina?"* 
  
  
Because they're too busy consuming magicka! You read right; the Enchanted Broom and Levitation Gem *immersively* consume magicka instead of stamina. Again, new players will achieve a max flight time of 20 seconds. Likewise, increased magicka converts to increased flight time. Will we use a stamina or magicka based glider? ONE lets us decide! No, Tarhiel's Gale doesn't use magicka. As in life, wind *immersively* comes free.
  
  
*Not balanced enough for you?*As of version ONE 2.0, Tarhiel's Gale has been reforged to a 5-second gale that staggers bystanders with a 30-minute cooldown. As of ONE 3.0, we'll also automatically take flight when Tarhiel's Gale is casted. The previously mentioned Kyne's Wind is a 3-second gale with a 10-second cooldown and is only available/equipped while gliding. That's enough balance to walk a tightrope!
  
  
*"But what if I don't want to fear death due to poor resource management?"*
  
  
ONE has two answers that! One, ?, if we run out of stamina/magicka mid-flight from High Hrothgar, it doesn't necessarily spell the end for our Dragonborn. With experience, we can learn not to panic and instead hone our skill of last second, lifesaving, glider re-deployment. So long as we have recovered just 5 stamina/magicka during our fall, we can perform and master this maneuver. Two, simply holding Left-Shift while clicking our glider in inventory will toggle stamina/magicka usage and cooldowns ON/OFF for all gliders. After all, ONE is about choice.
  
  
*Oh, you thought we were done?!*You thought right! That is pretty much it besides the aesthetic changes. Kyne's Wind FX reflects an *immersive* short gust of wind. No more awkward 4-8 second FX swamping our Dragonborn because we landed early. Tarhiel's Gale FX is similar but also includes a staggering shockwave (environment effects visual occurrence/changes) with a whirlwind effect. Time was taken to provide the lantern of Telvanni's Paragliding its very own ground model. I felt Levitation - A Paraglider's Add-On's gem deserved a more unique model than a soul gem, so one has been created. All gliders come complete with their animations/sounds as their author's intended. No compromises. No exceptions.
  
  
*"Ah, but will we lose the benefits ZERO provided us?"*
  
  
Everything ZERO gives to us, ONE also provides. This includes no soft-landing deaths, no loss of FX, no player re-equip after transformations/race changes, no unused - sometimes CTD inducing - records, and adds the *immersive* - lore accurate - Kynareth acquisition notification based on race. Yes, a ONE+ version is available which includes the original quest with a fresh take, rewritten without grammar/punctuation errors.
  
  
*Kynareth's winds guide you.*
