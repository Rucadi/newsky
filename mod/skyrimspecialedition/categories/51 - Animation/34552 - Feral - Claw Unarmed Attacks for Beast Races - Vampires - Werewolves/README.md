**Overview:**
  
  
Feral revamps unarmed combat for beast races, vampires and werewolves. The mod consists of two main components - animations and claws. Both components are available in several different versions, and can be used separately or together. The installer includes descriptions of what each option does so you can choose the version you like most.
  
 
  
 
  
**The Animations:**
  
  
Argonians and Khajiit, as well as any custom race tagged as a beast race, use unarmed attack animations that differ slightly from those of humans and elves. The game's animators had a different, more savage set of moves planned for beast races, but at some point during the game's development these got scrapped. However, the animations can still be found in the game files. Feral restores them and applies them to specific groups of NPCs using Open Animation Replacer.
  
  
The animations can be applied to:
  
  

  
* Beast Races (Player Character and NPCs).
Vampires (Player Character and NPCs).
  
* Werewolves (Player Character only).
Actors that equip the Claw weapons from this mod (Player Character and NPCs).
  

  
The game files do not contain the complete set of beast race animations, but the important ones are all there. This mod restores these animations:
  
  

  
* Regular attacks in all directions (1st and 3rd person).
Power attacks in all directions, including dual attack (1st and 3rd person).
  
* Sneak attacks (1st and 3rd person).
Unarmed idle (1st and 3rd person).
  
* Unarmed movement (3rd person only).

  
I recycled some of these animations to fill in for the missing ones:
  
  

  
* Unarmed movement, walking and running (1st person).
Sneaking unarmed idle (1st and 3rd person).
  
* Sneaking movement (1st and 3rd person).

  
Only the recoil animations are left unchanged, but their omission isn't very noticeable.
  
  
  
 
  
**The Claws:**
  
  
Feral provides the option to give certain Actors claws. These are purely cosmetic, and have no in-game effect. The mod relies on SPID and KID to distribute the claws and ensure that they appear only when they should (that is, when Actors are bare-handed, or are wearing gauntlets or gloves that leave their fingers exposed). This circumvents the need to edit meshes and armors, which reduces the chance of conflicts with other mods, and makes it easier to make patches for mods that add new gloves or gauntlets.
  
  
The claws can be applied to:
  
  

  
* Beast Races (Player Character and NPCs).
Vampires (Player Character and NPCs).
  
* Werewolves (Player Character only).
Actors that equip the Claw weapons from this mod (Player Character and NPCs).
  

  
The mod also adds a weapon version of the claws that can be crafted, tempered, enchanted and poisoned. The claws' damage output is not governed by the One-Handed or Two-Handed skill, and using them will not advance those skills.
  
 
  
 
  
**Plans for future updates:**
  
  

  
* Improved claw models.
Spell pack add-on.
  
* Unarmed skill tree.
Fearsome Fists CC integration.
