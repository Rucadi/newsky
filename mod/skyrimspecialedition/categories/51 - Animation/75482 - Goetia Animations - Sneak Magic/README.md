# Goetia Animations - Sneak Magic
- Author: Verolevi
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/75482
This pack will replace the following animations while sneaking:
  
  
[size=3]-The idle, walk, run while wielding magic or hybrid magic/melee.
  
-The magic equip, swap and unequip with either/both hands.
  
-All idles and movements while aiming with magic.
  
-Casting with any spell or staff with any hand configuration.

With the release of this mod, I'm happy to say that, through the Vanargand and Goetia series, all the essential ranged animations in the game have been remade, with the main goal being keeping the aim direction persistent (facing the crosshair) regardless of movement direction, aiming in 3rd person is now much more consistent than [vanilla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXTGw0JW9wY) across the different ranged playstyles.
  
  
For hybrid magic/melee playstyles: The movement from this mod will automatically take priority over the movement provided in my previously released sneak mods (Vanargand Sneak [Thrusts](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55031) and [Strikes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55420)) when a spell or a staff is equipped in either hand, this will ensure that the character will keep facing the crosshair as opposed to facing the movement direction.
