[left] ﻿There is no shortage of female animations on the Nexus. 
  
From idles to movement, people seem to be good at making women stand and move pretty. 
  
But for some reason, even after 11 years, no one seems to have done anything about the turning animations. [/left]
  

**Oh yes, you know what I'm talking about. Whenever you talk to an NPC and they turn around like a gorilla? That's right. That animation. 
  
  
Well I've had enough.**

**Here's feminine turning animation for NPCs! So women can finally move like women... 100% of the time.****[font=Comic Sans MS]Introducing Feminize:[/font]**

A project that seeks to turn 700 pound gorilla marauders Skyrim calls women into actual women. By modifying existing animations to point the elbows inward, close the knees and reposturing them, the female characters can finally move with grace and elegance... sort of. [/font]

[font=Comic Sans MS]This might the first in a series of mods, I hope to modify some other stand out animations such as the standing the counter, leaning against the wall, and much more. At this stage, all of these animations are very simple and quick edits, but I might revisit them and give them more polish, for example more detailed hand and finger movement, or adjustments to head and spine.
