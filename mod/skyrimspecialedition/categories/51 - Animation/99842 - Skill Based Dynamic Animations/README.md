Big thank you to Tsaxaman for the sneaking animations, which come bundled in this mod.

**SNEAKING MODULE**

From 1 to 50 sneak skill = Vanilla Animations
  
(or Relaxed Sneak Animations if installed)

From 50 to 75 sneak skill = "More Sneaky" animations

Above 75 sneak skill = Ultimate Sneaking Animations

﻿

\*Exceptions: Khajiit get the "ultimate sneaking" animations regardless of skill

  
* Recommendations: I strongly recommend installing "[Relaxed Sneak Animations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37260)﻿". Not necessary though.
Sneak module comes pre-packaged with animations from Underdog by Tsaxaman, who kindly allowed their use.
  

  
  
  

**-MAGIC MODULE-**

Character has less than 250 magicka points = Vanilla magic animations.

*Less experienced, rougher animations*

﻿
  
  

Character has more than 250 magicka points = whatever magic animations you've installed.
  
Shown in the example below: *Goetia Animations - Magic Spells*

*classier, more experienced magic animations*﻿

\*Exceptions: High Elves, Bretons and Dark Elves will get access to the "more experienced" animations regardless of skill.

  

  
* Requirements: This module requires you install *any* mod adding new magic animations. For example: [Goetia Animations - Magic Spells](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70204)﻿.
You just need to install that mod (or another similar mod) like normal, no need to configure anything or do anything special.
  
* Note: if you have a mod that changes first person animations, it will also work the same way. Yay.

  
  

**-ARCHERY MODULE-**
  
  
From 1 to 50 Archery skill = Vanilla archery animations.
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/nFx5UaA.gif)
  
*Less experienced, rougher animations*
  
  
﻿From 50 to 100 archery skill  = whatever archery animations you've installed.
  
Shown in the example below: *AGO (animations only - no plugin)*

*The character holds the bow with more confidence*﻿
  
  
\*Exceptions: Bosmer will get access to the "more experienced" animations regardless of skill.

  

  
* Requirements: This module requires you install *any*mod adding new archery animations. Example: [Vanargand Animations - Archery](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60323)﻿.
You just need to install that mod (or another similar mod) like normal, no need to configure anything or do anything special.
  
* Note: if you have a mod that changes first person animations, it will also work the same way. Yay.

**Will NPCs use this?**Yes, which is great. Because you'll be able to differentiate races and the skill of the NPC you're fighting for example just by looking at their animations/stance.
  
  
**Can I use DAR instead of OAR? Can I use OAR instead of DAR?**Yes. Use one of them. It will work with either of them.
  
  
**Do I need to configure something? Do I need to build animation folders? Do I need to write conditions?**No. It's all pre-configured already. All you have to do is install whatever archery/magic animation mods that you want, as you'd install any other mod.
  
  
**I see you've included a folder with animations for magic and archery. What are those?**Those are vanilla animations. I came up with this workaround to let YOU choose whatever animation mods you want to install without having to configure anything. I'm basically using vanilla animations to replace the modded animations. UNO REVERSE!
  
  
**Can this be expanded to swords? Can this be expanded to axes? Can this be expanded to...?**If I get a hold of more animations or ideas, I could expand it further. I'd love to give each race their own power attack animations for example. If you have made some animations or are planning to make some and want to collaborate, hit me up!
