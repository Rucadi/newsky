# BFCO HuiYiNa alternate directional attacks
- Author: Slamminslug - HuiYiNa

This mod replaces the default BFCO directional animations for blunt weapons and axes, as the long thrust attack didn't make much sense.
  
  
(This does not change directional attacks for swords, daggers, or great swords.)
  
  
During installation, overwrite BFCO.
