Did you ever catch a nice fresh fish an found yourself severely disappointed when you didn't even get to contemplate its beautiful scales while you hungrily gobbled it up.
  
  
Well no more !
  
  
Now, thanks to the amazing [Eating Animations and Sounds](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42602) and this little patch you can see all the possible varieties of fish, crab and sealife-based soups, wether you are on the go or sitting at a nice table, as you happily savor their rich flavor.
  
  
This mod covers all food items contained in the Fishing mod : fish and crabs (both cooked and raw) and soups (both cold and hot).
  
Almost every item has both standing and "sitting at a table" animations.
  
  
*COMPATIBILITY*
  
  
Compatible with the Creation Club Survival Mode out of the box. Any other mod that changes the Fishing mod's food records will need a dedicated patch.
  
If you ask nicely, I might make one (no promises though).
