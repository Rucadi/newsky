# Smooth Moveset - OAR (CPR)
- Author: VX09

**DESCRIPTION**
  
Newer behavior value than my old CPR patches and tested in my current setups.
  
This patch still based from Maxsu’s CPR defaults, since they’re already stable and well tuned.
  
But, since the original SCAR CPR patch gives every dual wield setup identical numbers,
  
which makes all dual wield NPCs behave almost the same in-game.
  
  
In this Smooth Moveset OAR (CPR), each dual wield weapon type now has its own movement profile.
  
Daggers, swords, war axes, and maces all use separate CPR values, and modded weapons that inherit those categories should follow along automatically.
  
This gives dual wield enemies behavior that actually fits their weapon type instead of a *one-size-fits-all* template.

  
  
  

**EXAMPLES**
  
*(More texts inside)*Spoiler
> Daggers receive the biggest change. Their new circling range and angle push them to move wider, reposition faster, and attempt flanking routes more often. Because dagger reach is shorter, their updated spacing and fallback timings help them slip around the player instead of trading hits head-on.
>   
> This makes dual wield dagger NPCs behave more like agile pressure fighters rather than sword users.
>   
>   
> One-handed dagger users and dagger-plus-shield users also get updated values.
>   
> One-handed daggers lean into evasive footwork and opportunistic spacing,
>   
> while dagger-and-shield NPCs play more measured by creating distance and re-engaging with intention.
>   
> They stay mobile, but with behavior that reflects the extra weight and defensive nature of a shield.

**DISCLAIMER**
  
This patch might only works with Smooth Moveset OAR the Nexus release edition, **not** the other site version.
  
  
  
**CLOSING**
  
CPR only governs how NPCs move around their target, which keeps this patch fully compatible with any mod that edits Combat Styles or AI behavior.
  
All it changes is how NPCs pick their angles, spacing, when should they sprint and movement choices based on the weapon they’re holding.
  
This creates distinct movement patterns or each weapon type, making encounters feel more varied without adding any extra setup or causing conflicts.
  
You’re free to pair it with aggressive, defensive, or balanced combat AI to fit with your setup.
