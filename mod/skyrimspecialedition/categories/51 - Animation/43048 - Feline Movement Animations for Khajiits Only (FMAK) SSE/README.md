[size=5]This is a SIMP-le port of my old rim mod, I will add more animations in the future.
  
  
DESCRIPTION 
  
  
This mod allows the player and NPC`s from the khajit race to sprint and sneaks like cats (in four legs). The animations only work on khajit races.
  
  
This will work with any custom khajit follower, provided they are from that race. For example followers like [INIGO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/40960) and [S'in -The Mane-](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/71672), are the reason for this mod.
  
  
There are 3 files.
  
  
1. The first one is for people who want Khajits and Vampire Khajits to use this set of animations (Standalone file).
  
2. The second file is the same as the last one, but has an additional condition for the werewolf. If you have (Beast power), your character will use the animations (Standalone file).
  
3.  Is an optional file with a different set of animations (Standalone)
  
  
AND NO!!! YOU DON'T NEED TO RUN FNIS OR NEMESIS, IT ONLY NEEDS DAR
