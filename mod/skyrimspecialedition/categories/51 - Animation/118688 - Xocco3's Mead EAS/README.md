?[Eating Animations and Sounds](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42602) ﻿(EAS) patch for Xocco3's Mead Replacer﻿ (XMead).
  
?Optional remodel of mead beverages added by [Gourmet](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/96876)﻿, in line with XMead. EAS patch included in main file, activated if you have Gourmet installed.
  
 ﻿?Animations from [Gourmet - EAS patch by shim2701](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98185)﻿ automatically replaced.
  
 ﻿?Texture options: 2K, 1K.
  
?Bubbles / no bubbles / [non-transparent (opaque)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/118753)﻿ options for EAS animobjects (for both Vanilla & Gourmet).
  
?Powered by AnimObject Swapper & SkyPatcher with zero conflicts.
  
?ESPFE (ESP flagged as ESL).
  
  
Nothing much to say. Needed a plugin for EAS because XMead introduces different models for some records that use generic mead mesh in Vanilla.
  
Also remodeled mead-like beverages added by Gourmet, namely Black-Briar Special, Honningbrew Limited, and Honningbrew Special.
  
  
  
?**COMPATIBILITY**
  
  
Corresponding animations from Gourmet - EAS patch by SultanBaklazhan automatically gets detected & replaced by my mod with main file. No need to do anything on your own.
  
[Xocco3's Meads Skypatched](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/109106) is compatible and recommended.
  
  
  
?️**INSTALLATION**
  
  
Safe to add/subtract/multiply/divide - new/mid/end game. Ensure that you are not under the effect of an EAS animation, it has a 10 second duration.
