Vanilla frost atronach has two normal attacks and two power attacks. Sometimes you see it repeating one single attack all the time until it breaks into pieces. Some monster mods are using frost atronach skeleton, so these monsters are performing monotonously.
  
  
This mod adds 3 different attack animations for frost atronach.
  
  
**Update: adjusted the normal attack speed to feel smoother the video.**
