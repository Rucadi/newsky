Just a personal mod I thought I'd share, werewolves are cool and all, but they play the howl animation every time they recover from being knocked down/staggered To even going through load doors They'll do it every time. There's also the small chance you ran into some modded creatures that don't look like they should be howling, This fixes that by using the power of DAR to reserve that cool howl for transformations only.
