[Tools are not weapons!](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70117)﻿ BUT you can still hit enemies with them! At least you can try...

I tried to make the animations heavy and clunky, so that tools (Pickaxe and Woodcutter's Axe) would feel unbalanced and awkward to use in combat. For what? For IMMERSION, of course!
  
  
For example, I like to start a playthrough as a prisoner miner or something like that and make my way to freedom with the tools at hand....
