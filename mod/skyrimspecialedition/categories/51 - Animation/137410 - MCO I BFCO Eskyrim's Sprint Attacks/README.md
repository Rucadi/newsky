Thirteen (**13**) sprint-attack variants for Greatswords (**4**), Battleaxe (**3**), Unarmed (**2**), and **one** each of Dual Dagger, Dual Sword, Mace, and Sword.
  
The animations will instantly smooth-transition into normal-attack (**NA**) or power-attack (**PA**) after a sprinting attack.
  
Optional staggers and effects from Elden Rim Weapon Arts.
  
  
**♦♦♦**
  
**? *Remastered Technical Notes:***
  
Spoiler
  
  
♦ Properly patched for **Precision Accurate Weapon-Collision**.
  
Weapon swing effects for both enchanted and non-enchanted weapons will work or shown.
  
♦ Custom hit's node for sprint attacks based on weapon's type and unarmed (*skeleton node*).
  
♦ Addition and adjustment of MCO/BFCO Recovery and other annotations, for dodge, block mods, etc.
  
♦ Allows chaining of attacks after sprint-attack for smoother combat transitions. (*Three download options available*)
  
♦ Various staggers on hit, sound, fog, vfx, etc. from Elden Rim Weapon Arts. (*Optional*)
  
(You can use only the Base version Elden Rim [No. **0**] for no extra content.)
  
  
**This sprint attacks based on Eskyrim's MCO Sprint Attack version 1.2 animation.**
  
*Some of my other mods also use animations from these, but they are heavily edited to include more thematic effects(vfx & sfx) and such.

**♦****♦****♦**
  
**HOW TO USE****♦** Simply manually drag and drop into your preferred moveset.
  
DAR/OAR doesn't matter, pick your sprint, or pick them all.
  
**♦** Alternatively, just pick the AIO version.
  
These are my picks, chosen from all three *attack-stage* options.
  
(*Unarmed attacks are sourced from the 3rd stage, sprint-attacks primarily from the 1st stage, and sprint power-attacks from the 2nd stage.*)
  
Bonus sprint attack configuration for Halberd, Quarterstaff and Twinblade.
