Designed to further complement the wonderful [Reanimated NPC Animations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/79079)﻿ using the power of either [DAR](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33746) or [OAR](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92109).
  
  
I love the mod, but I use a number of other animation overhauls as well and find it odd when I see these undead things using fancy new moves.
  
  
To make this work, I've forced the Reanimated to use the vanilla animations which aren't as good or fluid as just about every animation replacer out there.
  
Then, I took all the injured animations I could from an animation resource made by FunnyBizness on another site and added those in.
  
This allows the Reanimated to use these alternative animations when their weapons are out or in combat, something which is unfortunately not covered in the original mod by TheCyclist
  
  
Some of those animations by FunnyBizness are also used in the mod [Wounds injury animations DAR add-on](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54870)﻿ so you may already be familiar with them.
  
  
It's not perfect, but it certainly adds to the idea that the Reanimated bodies being forced into combat don't have their former skills or fluidity.
  
  
These should give you an idea of the types of animations you will see.
  
  
  
  
  
I have zero animation skills myself, so these are provided as-is.
  
  
It was set up with DAR conditioning to ensure compatibility with both animation frameworks.
