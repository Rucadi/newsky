# Arm Movement Animations (OAR)

[left]Arm Movement Animations (OAR mod) is an addition of more than 80 conditional dynamic replacers for offsetarmscrossed.hkx animation overlay in game. 
  
This animation is often gets activated for NPCs in dialogue and replaces arm movement from idle animations or gestures currently playing, resulting in characters seem less lively. That is not what I want in my Skyrim, especially with interesting characters like Sheogorath.

To help it I created Immersive Folded Hands mod, at the start DAR and OAR only allowed to add conditional variants of offsetarmscrossed animation. Now new OAR features made it possible for this mod to add so much more, I even had to change the name. Immersive Folded Hands becomes Arm Movement Animations because there are so much arm movement, it is rarely folded.
  
AMA replaces static folded arms animation overlay with rotation of:
  
  

  
* short motions like stretching, scratching, looking far away and so on
dynamic arm folding animations (with a special condition set to create an illusion of NPCs noticing player character with accordance to relationship rank)
  
* gestures to greet PC or NPCs
dialogue gestures according to relationship rank (PC with NPC, NPC with NPC), character personality and many other conditions
  

All animations have natural looking transition. See what Sheogorath will have with my mod instead of default arms glued together:
  
  
  
  
Better gestures in 2.1.0 version:

Compatibility
  
Just like my other mods PCG is technically compatible with everything.
  
Mods that change proportions of bodies are compatible, but will affect how animations from this mod are displayed. For example with [FK's Diverse Racial Skeletons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38563) mage offsetarmscrossed will look off with tallest and shortest races.
  
  
  
How to install
  
This mod works without Nemesis or FNIS. [Open Animation Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92109) needed only.
  
At any time in your playthrough add main mod archive to your mod manager and follow it's standard installation process. Don't forget to make mod active :)
  
If you don't like some animation from this mod, you can just disable OAR submod with it! Select NPC, use OAR animation log to know what and where, disable in User mode and save.

How to fix issue with Windows not reading files
  
*If during/after installation some sort of error pops up or animations in your game can`t play and you see static pose instead:*
  
Mod Organizer 2 users - [size=3]rename mod folder in your mod manager to "AMA OAR" and it will fix this
  
Other mod manager users - extract the zip file and rename the "Arm Movement Animations (OAR)" named folder to "Data", repack and install[/size][/left]
  
I appreciate very much all the tools that made it possible to realize my vision
  
Some of the files made by me in Blender with [Animation Tools N3+28](http://onedrive.live.com/?id=9C43AA9F34AE59F6!1629&cid=9C43AA9F34AE59F6) by tktk, the rest made from animations extracted from Animations.bsa with MO2 and modified with [hkxPoser](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11783) by [opparco](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/47355643), when it was needed.
  
And of course, existence of all my mods depends on genius [Open Animation Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92109) by [Ershin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/2749008)
