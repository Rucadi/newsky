> **-** All heavy armor fall animations should be no problem. Regardless of your speed modifiers, the animations will always play as intended. CurrentMovementSpeed ​​parameter in all animations (except the 3rd one - folder number 10131, it has an additional condition ≤375, don't pay attention. In most cases it doesn't affect anything) is set to ≥0. Bottom line: there should be no problem with "heavy" jumps, namely falls , and is suitable for "everything".

> - By default, the speed of the actor's movement in vanilla during sprint is slightly higher than the value of 370. In the landing settings of "heavy armor" such conditions are selected so that animations are played for running below this value, and for sprint above. In my tests with mods to slow down the actor in heavy armor, everything works as it should. In vanilla, everything should also work as intended. If your actor is tall (for example, your character Altmer), then due to the fact that he moves faster, you will simply play animations during a calm run that other actors would play during a sprint. I do not see any problems in this, due to the fact that you are taller and therefore the speed is higher and therefore your landing is appropriate. If this does not suit you, you need to set the value in the OAR settings not 370, but 375 (see gif). All folders are signed and it will be easy for you to navigate them. But in general, there should be no problems either.

> **-** Exactly the same as for the hard variant, but only for the easy one. Some additions: if you notice the folders with numbers 9118 and 9121 (landing during sprint) have the "Random" condition, i.e. all two animation execution variants, and for example in the "hard" type, only two out of three, i.e. not all variants, then this is how it should be. In order to replace the vanilla animation, one of the variants should not have the "Random" condition, then it will replace the original animation, and any number of other animations should have this condition so that they are played at an ambiguous time. So for the "light" landing, the main replacement variant is the somersault from the "naked" section. But it will be played less often than the others. And in the "heavy" section, there is its own main replacement variant, it is just without the "Random" condition.

>   
> **-**I am generally very pleased with this section and am not worried. Since there are no speed bindings here, and animations can be played if the "IsSprinting" condition is set. Which cannot be said about the falling and landing animations. Everything will work under any conditions, even if you are a giant.

> - Same story with falls. I achieved stable playback of these animations in previous versions. And in general, everything is fine. Although I have the "FallDistance" condition, it actually does nothing. But here the picture is saved by the fact that under any unforeseen circumstances, a fall with waving arms will be played. And in all other cases (including - not sprint) relaxing animations of falling will be played. Summary: I'm still thinking about how to make everything work clearly, but now there will be no problems (it seems). In the end, after all the comments to the sections, I will give a general conclusion regarding falling and landing.

>   
> - It was complicated. Let me start with the fact that "naked" jumps have three falling animations. Two of them (8117, 8116) have a priority by folder number, but the third (8119 - a special diving animation) has a different root priority - 6. This number is not necessary, the main thing is that it is lower than the first two. I was radical. And left the original folder number. Second. Initially, I wanted animation 8119 to be played only if the player jumps towards the water. It is not possible to do this via OAR yet. Then I wanted the animation to be played only if the fall height (the "FallDistance" condition) was higher than a certain value. So that diving would not be played when running on the ground. It is also impossible to do this via OAR (at the moment). As a result, as with all falling animations, only the "Currentmovementspeed" condition works. Although my mod has a couple more conditions (AND), it is essentially garbage and this condition remained after my numerous tests. In general, there may not be any problems, sprint and sometimes you will have a dive. You can be lucky and the stars will align and you will dive into the water, and not into the rock. To make everything more adequate, animations 8117, 8116 do not depend on speed, only random. Therefore, most often you will fly down and dive in a group. There is only one problem with all this. When you sprint and do not jump, but fall from some ledge, a special diving animation 8119 may play, which in normal mode does not look so impressive, because there will be no transition to it. Because it is already with a downward slope. And I personally do not like it. But I can not achieve better yet. The conclusion is this: we need a new OAR condition that evaluates or checks what surface the character falls and lands on, and depending on this, its own animation will be played. It can be organized differently, if you have any ideas, write to me. I wrote in posts to the creator of OAR, about adding a similar condition, but only for water. But now I think that we need to evaluate any surface the character falls on. At this stage, I did the maximum to make it beautiful and convenient to jump. Third. The speed condition is 370, if you just run without sprinting and see that you sometimes have a diving animation (not grouped animations) and a somersault is played, then you need to change the "speed" to 375. This should be done in folders 8119, 8112, 8111 (see gif). The idea was this: when you are not in sprint, you have normal jump animations (like in other types, they are common for all) with a special animation of landing on your hands (switch to walking and jump and you will definitely see it) and only when you are in sprint you have a jump animation - diving and falling diving. In the current conditions, if you change the speed, different from 375, sometimes in sprint there will still be animations 8117, 8116 (group position), as I wrote above this is necessary for the "balance of beauty".

>   
> 1. In general, everything should work fine and there shouldn't even be "flying birds", I took care of that.
>   
> 2. Only the "Currentmovementspeed" condition can affect the fall and landing animations, other conditions may do nothing. Therefore, in 10-20% of cases, individual setting of conditions in OAR will be required. I suggested one solution above. It may require implementing my MCM menu and FOMOD installer (I don't know how to do this, and neither one nor the other, if anyone is ready to help me, write).

> ~~**1.** I am very close to finishing the implementation of heavy jumps to a lower height. I understood what needs to be done (~~Maybe soon, I'm impatient myself :)~~).~~I abandoned this idea! The implementation makes the mod too heavy, and testing and writing a script (which I don’t particularly like and can do) takes me away from the main thing - drawing excellent animations!
>   
> **2.** The jump in Skyrim is not impressive, and I thought about why it is not impressive, and found the answer - there are no dust, snow, dirt effects when landing (the feature will be available at an unspecified time).
>   
> **3.** Players on Nexus said that the sound of takeoff and flight is needed - so the sound will be (the feature will be available at an unspecified time).
>   
> **4.** There are different jumps on Nexus, especially double jump and/or magic jump stand out, but none of them offer more functional, in my opinion, mechanics - the concentration effect, holding the space button should lead to a powerful dash upwards. Maybe such a mod exists, but I do not know about it. In my vision, the feature should work with any type of movement. This feature, in my opinion, is only needed because when I want to jump while I'm somewhere on the edge of a rock, tree or something, the jump just won't work, so my solution is to do a charged jump. Typical situation: I jump from a bad place, from where it is impossible to make a normal jump (you press space, but there is no jump). I call it a problem - a hole between two stones (the mechanics will be available at an unspecified time).
>   
> ~~**5.** Of course, jumping into water from any surface.~~Let's assume that it's done, or in other words, in the "first approximation"... (see update 0.5.0)!
>   
> ~~**6.** Animation of landing from medium height (soon).~~ I did all kinds of landing animations. They are not divided by height, but distributed by equipment and by speed. I think this point can be considered completed!
>   
> **7.** ~~I think it would be great to add ragdoll when falling from very high points, but this is doubtful (maybe will be at an unspecified time).~~
>   
> No! I am satisfied with the results of the obtained animations. So it's better to look not at the doll but at the smooth movements that were drawn by me (they are very diverse) :)
>   
> **8.** Jumps in all directions need to be added (this will be an optional addition to the main mod and will be added after version 1.0 when I want to work on the jump again. Or not).
>   
> **9.** If you have withstood this pressure of my ambitions after reading the previous points, then know that this is nothing compared to what I really want to do. I am talking about the ability to climb any surfaces and ledges without interrupting the gameplay. I know that there is a wonderful mod "SkyClimb", but this is not enough for me. And then a miracle happened. Todd released Starfield and showed that this can be done, who played, he knows that when colliding with a ledge, the player will simply jump up and climb. For me, this is a masterpiece. My goal is to do the same in Skyrim, whether I will succeed or not, no one knows.
>   
> **10**. ~~"I need gravity settings" (will appear at an unspecified time).~~During all this time I realized that vanilla gravity settings are quite acceptable for my animations, so no!
>   
> Of course, during the implementation, other jump animations can be added, as I achieve these goals. I will be able to draw all the animations 100%, the most difficult thing will be to implement them into the game. Having done all the specified points, I will calmly announce the completion of the Dova Jump project - **version 1.0**

> P.S. Dear players, be sure to read these lines. I need to give you some clarification. This update is the most legendary in my opinion.  I really like all the new animations. At least some of them were not easy to draw. The new animations are not exhaustive. I implemented 3 fast sprint jump animations for heavy armor and a landing animation for the entire jump type. This update does not include jumping in place while wearing heavy armor. Additionally, I was planning to implement a system that would allow me to reduce my jump height while wearing heavy armor. But I did not achieve the desired results. For those who want to play with this function, I can only suggest the following mod: [Pick Your Own Speed and Jump Height](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/96567)﻿. It will allow you to set the jump height yourself to the desired value. In my tests, the most optimal jump height would be between 58 and 70. Choose to your taste. If you set the value lower, then when you land, a falling animation will start and you will float through the air. Of course, if you remove the armor, it is better to return the jump to its previous position (100). Please forgive me for the temporary inconvenience. When I get everything ready, this function will be placed in the additional download section, not the main one. Because someone may not like such “mechanics”. And most importantly! I was able to neutralize the "skates". Look at what it looks like with heavy armor and when moving without it (sprinting). These are different ways of overcoming. Tell me what you like best. And then I will finally come to the conclusion regarding the “sliding” when approaching the finish line.[img width=624,height=60]https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD\_4nXcRO89eaQoLKQ28y2UyZCiHnxPsSfogr94gqY-iujoKhWRPobxaGqcAg8O3CIVvuI7iKu-hGi8w6zkGlxFfs-RAAdSABuqecL9J06Pl8IN9dTx5e58Egm\_8W6b1KumNvxbiUNp\_DMY4nJNVt-\_BMa7epvg?key=WfOqH7FFFkjsgUf6plcAbA[/img]

> **• What sprint/run animation do you use with him?**
>   
> [font=Arial]In my game I use animations of running without a weapon: [Leviathan Animations II - Male Idle Walk And Run](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81463)  (For walking and idle I use vanilla options, for this I deleted the corresponding .HKX files from the internal folders of the mod)
>   
> I have animation set as sprint: [Leviathan Animations II - Sprint](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/82603) .
>   
> Any movement with a weapon in hand I use vanilla to avoid dash animations (or just reduce the number of them).

>   
> [i]**•*****Is it compatible with Smooth Random Jump animations and their other jumping mods?**
