Weapon-specific dodge animations with support for TK Dodge, Ultimate Dodge, and DMCO
  
  
There are animations for step, roll, and attack cancellation.
  
  
  
Step and roll evasion is an evasion that increases the distance from the opponent, but attack cancel evasion avoids it on the spot with a small movement distance. like SWAY
  
  
  
  
  
  
Attack cancel roll version added with 1.3 update
