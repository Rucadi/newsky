Ever since I illustrated this scene for a good friend over a year ago, I've lowkey wanted to bring some of the elements into the game and finally got around to it.
  
  
So this lightweight mod implements two new/modified animations to Sinding when you first meet him in prison, just for a bit of immersion.
  
  
**How it works:**
  

  
* I've placed a vanilla invisible rail-leaning furniture right behind the prison bars, and modified Sinding's greeting AI package to instead activate the said furniture rather than saying things like "Need something?", and the rail-leaning animations have been replaced for Sinding, using DAR/OAR, so he'll instead look like he's grabbing onto the bars, pleading to get out of his cell somehow.
Sinding will use another DAR-replaced idle that is originally the one where Delphine gives the player the horn of Jurgen Windcaller, but here it's supposed to be Sinding showing/giving the player the cursed ring of Hircine.
  

  
**Known issues:**
  

  
* Due to how the furniture/idle marker covers the whole area he's standing on when you talk to him, after he exits the animation, he may sometimes slide down the small ladder behind him, depending on if he's playing a dialogue idle which causes him to move.

  
**Requirements:**
  

  
* [Dynamic Animation Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33746) or [Open Animation Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92109)
[AnimObject Swapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/75167)﻿﻿﻿
  

  
**Installation:**
  

  
* Make sure you have the required files installed. You can download the archive, open your mod manager (such as Vortex or MO2) and drag-and-drop it into the program.

  
Note - This is just a mere modification of a few vanilla animations made in [hkxposer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11783), it's far from perfect, and I'm not in the mood to take my time to import an existing hkx file into Blender for more precise modifications as I don't currently have it installed.
  
If anyone wants to help me improve the animations, like making the grip of the bars more steady, you're very welcome to do so.
