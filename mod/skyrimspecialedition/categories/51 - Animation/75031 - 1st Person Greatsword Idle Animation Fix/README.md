Regrettably, Todd never deemed the greatsword worthy of a first person idle animation -- your arms are completely still, the sword completely static. A mod like [Size Matters](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45177) fixes this, but if you're not a fan of the attack animations (e.g. because they don't have camera movement), then the idle animation won't blend well with the vanilla attack animations. Another mod, [First Person Greatsword Idle Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5995), attempts to fix this by repurposing the same idle animations used by warhammers and battleaxes, but in first person only the right hand is visble, so it ends up looking weird for a sword.
  
  
This mod addresses the issue by taking the walk cycle (2hm﻿\_walkforward), slowing it down so the motion isn't as intense, and repurposing that as the idle animation. The result is more or less indistinguishable from what should have been in vanilla.
