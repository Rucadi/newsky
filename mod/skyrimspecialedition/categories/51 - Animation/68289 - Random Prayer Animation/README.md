Change the prayer animation to operate randomly with 6 movements introduced in the video.
  
  
  
There are two versions: a version used only by the player and a version used by NPCs as well.
  
  
  
It goes well with a mod where players like [Wintersun](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506) often pray.
  
  
  
Oh, by the way, I am not religious.
  
  
  
  
1.1 Update
  
I've separately uploaded a version that removed the animations reminiscent of certain religions.
