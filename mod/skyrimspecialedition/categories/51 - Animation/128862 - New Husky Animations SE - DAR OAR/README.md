[LE Mod Page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/119024)For anyone interested, check out my newest [Silver Fang mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/129252) where I included this animation replacer as standalone for these two followers!
  
  
While I took my time to create the [sploot animation mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/128857), I was inspired to spice up the huskies from Dawnguard with their own new animations. Mainly because I always thought they seemed rather bland or a bit too wolfish.
  
I practically just played around with the graph editor in Blender, re-posing the neck/head/tail nodes.﻿
  
  
Compatible with my [Doge Cheems animation replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/125043)
  
  
Known issues: May look glitchy in a few frames at times but it's kinda rare, and nothing game-breaking.
