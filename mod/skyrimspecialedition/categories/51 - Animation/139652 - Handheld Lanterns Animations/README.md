This mod is an **expansion** of sorts, for my [Torch Idle Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/103080)﻿
  
It is also a **companion** mod meant to bring idles to [Handheld Lanterns](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/135973)﻿
  
I have altered all 6 [Dynamic Torch Idles](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/103080)﻿ to support the **lanterns** in this mod
  
Along with creating new **Two Handed Idle** for the **Dwemer** Lantern
  
  
"[Dynamic Female Weather Idles](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98493)﻿ has also received a **supporting update**
  
Which adds **snowing lantern idles** to prevent weird anim blending"

**Thanks to Kars for the original Blender Rig used in these animations creation**
  
  
Permission to edit/release/update/distribute these files in part noncommercially **only on nexusmods**
  
as long as you credit me as the original creator! This is **not a greenlight** to reupload my work in part or whole
  
as separate animation packs; **however**, most things are fine, as long as they still require my original mod.
  
Please **consult me** if you are interested in porting to Skyrim LE or Console
  
  
If you are interested in including these animations in your own mod packs
  
Misc files **Animation Resources OAR** can be added as a requirement to your pack
  
This allows for a nondestructive method of adding new configs to my animations
