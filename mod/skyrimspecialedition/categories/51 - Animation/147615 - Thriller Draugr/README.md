This animation was made as a joke when I needed something to test my draugr animation rig.
  
  
Then [Frayed](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/FrayedLL?gameId=1704) made a brilliant OAR config for it.
  
  
Then I forgot I've had it installed.
  
  
"*... why are muh Draugrs dancing all of the sudden?!*" **o\_O**
  
  
(perfect usecase right there, I think)

**Factual boring information that I probably should add:**
  
this OAR replacer conditionally makes draugr & skeleton actors that are not currently in combat mode play the idle inspired by Michael Jackson's "Thriller" song when the in-game clock nears midnight.

*As twilight's cloak doth softly fall,
  
A shadowed fiend doth creep and crawl.
  
'Neath silver moon's enchanting light,
  
A vision comes to chill thy fright.*
  
  
*Forsooth, 'tis night of dread and fright,
  
No champion shall shield thee from the beast in sight.
  
Thou knowest well, 'tis night of thrill,
  
In battle for thy life 'gainst the killer’s will.*
