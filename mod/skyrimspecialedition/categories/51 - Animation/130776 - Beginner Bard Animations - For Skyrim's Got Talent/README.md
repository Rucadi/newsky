Skill based animations for bards. Your character won't play Lutes, Flutes or Drums as confidently as a pro, when your talent for that particular instrument is still low.

**[font=Georgia]CUSTOMIZATION[/font]**

  
You can make this mod work for other mods if they add something that OAR can use as a condition.
  
You can also enable the animations for [Lurbuk](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Lurbuk), by opening the mod in OAR and toggling the "IsActorBase" condition.
