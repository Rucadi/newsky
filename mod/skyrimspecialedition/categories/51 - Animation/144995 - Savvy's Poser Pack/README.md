# Savvy's Poser Pack
- Author: savvy9379

My first pose pack! These are intended to be gender neutral/more masculine poses. ESL flagged.
  
  
Run FNIS/Nemesis/Pandora after installing. These can be used with [Screen Archer Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/66047) for Skyrim SE (on Maxie's Discord), [Photomode](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/91701), or [Poser Hotkeys](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22860). If you're using Poser Hotkeys, don't forget to run PoserGenData.exe.
  
  
I will be adding more poses to this pack in the future! ❤️
  
  
My thanks and credits to [hkxPoser by opparco](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11783), for the program I used to make each of these poses, and [hanshotfirst01](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/hanshotfirst01?gameId=1704), for her patience and guidance in teaching me how animations work under the hood, and helping me compile them into this esp. ❤️
