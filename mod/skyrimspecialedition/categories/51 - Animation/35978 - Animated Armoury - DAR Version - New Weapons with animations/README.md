[line][size=3][size=3][size=3][size=6]**Compatibility** 
  
[size=3][size=3][size=3][size=3][size=3][size=3]
  
Combat Gameplay Overhaul + is sort of semi incompatible with Animated Armoury, you wont get crashes or nasty issues, but even with the Nemesis version the animations may not play correctly or have incorrect timings on the attacks and swings, some animations don't even play
  
  
SkySa as far as I know is not compatible as no animations haven't been made

[/size][/size]
  
[/size][line]**[size=6]Rapiers**
  
They deal a little less damage than Swords, have much higher Crit damage, are faster than Swords and have a lot of range
  
  
[/size][line]**[size=6]Pikes**
  
Pikes are a new type of Two Handed weapon, they deal a little less damage than Greatswords, are faster than Greatswords and have more range
  
[/size][line]**[size=6]Halberds**
  
Halberds are a new type of Two Handed weapon, they deal a little less damage than Greatswords, are faster than Greatswords and have more range than BattleAxes
  
[/size][line]**[size=6]Quarter Staffs**
  
Quarter Staffs are a new type of Two Handed weapon, they deal a tiny bit more damage than Maces, their power attacks hit more than once though
  
[/size][line]**[size=6]Claws**
  
Claws are a new type of One Handed weapon, they deal less damage than Daggers but have a chance to inflict a stackable bleed debuff they are designed to be dual wielded but can be used in either hand, they cannot be used for parrying, when wielded together they can unleash a flurry of swipes
  
[/size]
  
[size=3][size=3][size=3][line]**[size=6]Chain Whips**
  
[/size]
  
Chain Whips are a new type of One Handed weapon, they light of damage, a bit slower to attack with than a sword and provide mid range damage, they have near instant recoil recovery, ideal as an offhand weapon
  
  
Due to the nature of whips being an animated weapon, they can sometimes be a bit jank in terms of animation, sometimes NPC's will have their whip randomly animate when blocking, a whip can animate faster than the player can transition between animations etc. Also if you want to wield two whips together you need to get a dual wield variant(prefixed by the word dual) from the add Item menu or console, these don't appear in levelled lists[/size][/size]
  
[line]
  
**Katanas**
  
  
Katana's are one handed swords they're simular to regular swords but used in both hands, when you equip another weapon in your left hand you use katanas with one hand only
  
  
[/size][line]**[size=6]Mace and Dagger animations**
  
  
Not a new weapon type but I wanted to make animations for these two weapons for a while now, the animations will apply to existing Maces and Daggers
  
[/size]
