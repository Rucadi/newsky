Replaces the player's mining animation for a DAR animation that is 75% faster.
  
  
**Can I get ore faster by just using this animation?**Yes. The ore/gem chance is synchronized.
  
  
**Any incompatibilities?**
  
So far I didn't find any issues with mods that modifies or uses mining, but who knows.
  
  
**Is it safe to enable or remove mid-game?**It's just an animation replacer, so yes.
