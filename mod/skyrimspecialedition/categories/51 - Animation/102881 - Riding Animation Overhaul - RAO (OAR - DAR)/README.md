Ever wondered why your character (yes you) has the audacity to judge followers- no names mentioned- claiming to be terrible at riding a horse but in reality everyone rides like a s'wit? Me too, so I made a replacer.
  
  
  
**[font=Courier New]? Requirements:
  
[/font]**• None for the main version, it'll work out of the box.
  
• DAR/OAR if you're using a gender-specific or player only version. Keep in mind this mod won't show up in OAR's menu, but that doesn't mean it's not working. This is because I used the DAR folder format, but OAR can read DAR conditions. 
  
  
**[font=Courier New]❗Recommendations / Mods featured in (1.0-1.2) screenshots & GIFs:
  
[/font]**• [Light Horses of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33692), [Witcher Horse Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72490) -- seen in screenshots (screenshots with Witcher Horse Expansion are modified meshes).
  
• [Craftable Saddles from Witcher 3](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64503)-- seriously this is awesome and very underrated.
  
• My [Horse Animation Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/140122)﻿ and [ZZjay's Horse Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63640) (seen in 1.4 gifs)
  
  
✍️ **[font=Courier New]Update Log:
  
[/font]**1.1 - Tweaked leg positioning so toes point slightly outward and left leg no longer clips with basic saddles, smoothed and retimed gallop and lope animations to flow better, adjusted idle. 
  
1.2 - **Added combat animations, added turn animations (normally only seen in use with NPC's),** even more tweaking, including editing feet positions to be consistent for each speed, retimed trot, adjusted hands for trot and lope.
  
1.3 - **Added idle rear-up and jump animations,** tweaked idle animation to keep similar hand position as walk animation for a smoother transition.
  
1.3.1 - ~~I may or may not be an idiot~~-- Same as 1.3 but no more t-posing from unconverted animations. ?
  
1.4 - Adjusted base riding animations to flow more naturally. Reframed most animations so that they should now be in exact sync with your horse. 
  
2.0 (Major Update) - *postponed to be released in early 2026*
  
**[font=Courier New]? Notes & Extras:
  
[/font]**• Safe to install/uninstall midgame. No Nemesis/FNIS generation required. If you're experiencing a bug, it's most likely caused by something else since this replaces vanilla content, but I'm open to concerns.
  
•  Animations are more or less visually compatible depending on your setup. The way Skyrim horses were built makes it nearly impossible to have no clipping and/or feet + hands in the correct position at all times (i.e. in stirrups, on reins, etc.). However, I did my best to where this should fit most horse and tack replacers (honestly with about as much or less clipping as vanilla animations), as well as vanilla horses and tack. Currently considering work-arounds for this.
  
• I built these animations to resemble how you would actually ride a horse. You could say having experienced firsthand the full effect of poor foot positioning on horseback was inspiring. Heels down my friends, heels down. 
  
• If you're wondering why my horse animations look different, I ported Horses Revamped ([https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/70640](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/70640)﻿ -- damn fine work) to SE for personal use. I haven't asked for permission to upload the port though, sorry. *Also, 1.2 and 1.3 screenshots/gifs were taken with WIP custom horse/saddle models so they'll fit a bit differently on your setup.*
  
• (Not updated) LE version here ([https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/116713](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/116713))
  
• Please keep in mind combat animations sometimes get out of sync when you shoot/swing, not much I can do about that. Just consider it immersive. ?
  
• Since y'all were asking, outfit in 1.1 gifs was included in this mod. ([https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81673](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81673))
  
• May or may not have spent way too much time perfecting gifs.
  
**• Go check out [@MasterCheesey](http://www.youtube.com/@mastercheesey) and authors that shared this mod on YouTube! Thanks so much for featuring this mod in your video, you're awesome!**
  
• Secret appreciation to [@Deleted67349201User](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/67349201) since my lazy ? referenced a condition for the player only version instead of looking for it elsewhere.
  
• ? Deepest apologies if you came here for a different kind of riding, also for putting way too many emojis... but they're cute, admit it. 
  
  
**I appreciate each and every one of your comments and endorsements, the support means more than you know and keeps me motivated! As for my fellow equestrians, it's so awesome to know trained eyes enjoy this as well. :)**
  
  
Thanks for the visit and reading, hope you enjoy the mod. ♥
