[/font]

  

  
* [font=Arial]4 completely different animation sets - you can choose the one you like in "optional files", or use them all with [STANCES](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40484)﻿ mod[/font]
[font=Arial]Compatible with all other 1st person animation mods - my mod has higher priority, so you can just install it over other animation overhauls and it overwrite waraxe animations only[/font]
  
* [font=Arial]Mostly vanilla timings[/font]
[font=Arial]No over-the-top animations, no reverse grip - everything is as close to realism as possible without hurting gameplay and entertainment [/font]
  
* [font=Arial]Just the right amount of camera animations - to add weight to attack, but not to overwhelm your senses[/font]
[font=Arial]Precision support[/font]
  
* [font=Arial]Smooth transitions between attacks[/font]
[font=Arial]Unique dodge animations - you don't just put hand under the screen anymore[/font]
  
* [font=Arial]Unique stagger animations - unlike vanilla, where your hand just go under the screen[/font]
[font=Arial][STANCES](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40484)﻿ mod support - if you don't want to choose between animation sets - you can have them all[/font]
  
* [font=Arial]If you have [AMR](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50258)﻿ installed - backward and standing power attacks would be actually useful[/font]

[font=Verdana]❖ FAQ ❖[/font]

[font=Arial]Q: Is it compatible with X?
  
A: Should be compatible with everything, but if not - tell me about it
  
  
Q: You said that you changed every animation, but you actually forgot X!
  
A: If it's not sprint, or sneak attacks - then yeah, i forgot, tell me about it! 
  
  
Q: Attacks are not realistic, this doesn't look like HEMA at all!
  
A: As i said - i needed to maintain balance between realism and satisfying animations, ofc you wouldn't swing this slow and wide in real sword fight, but this is just a game.
  
  
Q: Camera movement makes me motion-sick
  
A: Sad to hear this, but i won't do anything about this, because it will require A LOT of VERY boring work from me.
  
  
Q: I don't like something!
  
A: Sad to hear this, but i also won't do anything about this (if it's not a bug). Blender is free, you can make anims yourself.[/font]

[font=Arial][Precision](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72347) - for accurate hit timings, my mod would work without it, but some attacks would have *slight* desync between animation and actual hit
  
[Stances](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40484)﻿ - yeah, yeah, i told you 100 times already, but my mod fits perfectly with this one
  
[AMR](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50258)﻿ - for custom movement in power attacks
