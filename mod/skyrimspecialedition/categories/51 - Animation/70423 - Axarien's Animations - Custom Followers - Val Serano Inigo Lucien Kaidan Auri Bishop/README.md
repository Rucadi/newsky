I wanted the custom followers I use to move uniquely in my game. This mod gives them each their own unique styles - without affecting your character or any other NPCs. This mod works with either Open Animation Replacer or Dynamic Animation Replacer. It is not necessary to use FNIS or Nemesis for this mod, but it is perfectly fine to use at the same time for your other mods that require it. Available as an AIO or individual follower downloads.
  
  
Recommended: [Disable NPC Stretching Idle](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61309). Makes Val, Inigo, and Bishop in particular look less "twitchy" with their 1-handed idles.
  
  
**VAL SERANO**
  
Pirate, thief, liar, charming rogue, relic hunter, master mage - you name it and Val's got a moveset for every step of his journey with you. I consider it my best work to date. Covers Val's idles, all movement, and combat as a spellsword, crossbow archer, or mage. Includes a bonus sit and walk animation for Jena Avarix.
  
  
This is currently the same animation set that is in Val's FOMOD, but after his next update the animations download will be here only.
  
  
**INIGO**
  
Includes 1-handed sword, sits, idles, jump, archery, shield, sneak.
  
  
**LUCIEN**Lucien Flavius, your bubbly, cheerful bestie who I felt would add some flair and pizazz to his combat moves: This mod gives him some unique animations focused on his abilities as a mage, warrior, or archer. Also includes idles, sitting, run/sprint, jump.
  
  
This mod is immersive and will apply Lucien's animations based on his combat skill level. His new sit, movement, and idle animations are always active. But since Lucien's abilities grow over time, he will not start with fancy casting or fighting animations. You will need to develop his skills to at least 40, which will activate certain style animations. The styles he's not skilling up in will remain with the vanilla animations. So for example, once his magical abilities reach certain levels he will start to look more proficient (and imo, cooler) by using custom animations. In fact, poor Lucien will initially have a chance to fall awkwardly on his face while attacking with a one-handed weapon until his skills are more proficient.
  
  
There is an optional patch which will activate all the combat animations (and deactivate the wipe-out) regardless of his skill level if you prefer the instant gratification route.
  
  
**KAIDAN**
  
I wanted Kaidan to move uniquely in my game, and everyone's favorite Akaviri boyfriend should look as cool as possible at all times. Includes animations swaps for almost all of his animations with a focus on two-handed swordsmanship and archery. Gives Kaidan his own unique 2-handed sword fighting style, dagger attacks, archery style, sneaking, various idles, sit animations, and a few bonuses. Works with either Kaidan 2 or Kaidan Revoiced so make sure you download the correct file.
  
  
The Kaidan replacer with facial hair is [Kaidan Silvered](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73821)﻿.
  
  
**AURI**
  
Includes archery, walk, run, sneak, idles, sits.
  
  
**BISHOP**
  
No one: ...
  
Not one single soul: ...
  
Me: I shall make an animation mod for Bishop!
  
  
I have a soft spot for this jackass ranger and made this mod for my own playthroughs. This mod helps with Bishop's chief redeeming quality of appearing sexy by giving him some unique animations. Includes archery, daggers, idle, sneak, walk, run/sprint. Bonus idles-walks-runs for Alec, Cael, Casavir, Darren, Neeshka, Thorn. Works with either the regular or the animated versions so make sure you download the correct file.
