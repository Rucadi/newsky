**SCAR COMBO VERSION OF THIS MOD - [New Creature Animation - Dwarven Centurion - SCAR2.0 - MCO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/137805?tab=files)**
  
Overheat Mode:
  
Intense combat causes the Centurion to overheat, making its fighting style more frenzied as it needs to release heat from its core. Be cautious! Using fire magic against it will also affect its overheating condition.
  
  
Overload Mode:
  
Rapid operation causes centurion's circuits to overload, making its attacks more unpredictable. During this time, it needs to discharge high-voltage currents, which can result in attacks with immense force.
