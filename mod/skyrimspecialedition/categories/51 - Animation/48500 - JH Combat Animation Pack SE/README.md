JH Combat Animation Pack for SkySA**
  
  
﻿With **260+** animations this pack aims to create a seamless gameplay experience, where animations work together. The ultimate goal is to animate pretty much everything combat-related for a SkySA-Skyrim. Many of the attack animations included take inspiration or direct reference from Dark Souls, and overall are designed to have a similar feel.

"Duplicate"-attacks are slightly adjusted to better fit the chain of attacks.
  
For instance, a normal attack chain could be Attack1 -> Attack2 -> Duplicate Attack1 -> Attack4.
  
I opted for less variety in power attacks (within each weapon type) to keep a consistent feel.

KNOWN ISSUES
  
  
For armors that use skirtbones (not SMP related), the skirt will clip through many of the animations. I will iron this issue out in future updates.
  
Issues with power attacks registering incorrectly. I will keep optimizing for future updates.﻿﻿﻿ For now (and in general) I recommend a mod that separates power attack input from left click.
  
  
FUTURE UPDATES PLANNED
  
but not promised :)

﻿
  
Sprinting attacks & Bleedouts 0.90
  
Magic & Staves 1.0

Adjustments or additions to the weapon modules possible for each step.
  
Conditional animations are on the table too.

﻿

﻿Considering creature animations should an appropriate framework exist for it :)

  
  
Thanks for downloading :) I've been enjoying animation. I hope you enjoy them as much as i enjoyed making them.
