**[font=Georgia]REQUIREMENTS[/font]**

  
  
- [Open Animation Replacer (OAR)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92109)﻿
  
- [Immersive Equipment Displays ﻿(IED)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62001): To display and change the position of weapons and to use the animations.
  
- [Open Animation Replacer - IED conditions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98308): Required to use the conditions for OAR.
  
  

**[font=Georgia]HOW DOES IT WORK[/font]**

  
Using IED, select the placement of the weapon in "View>Gear Nodes>Placement". And that's it, the mod should automatically pick the corresponding animations for the actors. It just works:

Style randomizer is possible with this mod:
  

Spoiler![](https://i.imgur.com/Vw1lcfu.png)

This video might be a bit dull, but it should show what the mod does:

  
Uninstall [previous](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77017) version of the mod if you want to use this.[/size]
  
  
**[font=Georgia]

SUPPORT

[/font]**- Added support to [Combat Gameplay Overhaul SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33767): Allows to use animations when dual wielding two-handed weapons.
  
- Added support to [size=3][Extra Drawing Animations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37804)[/size]: Added the folders from EDA to this mod so you don't have to actually uninstall it.
  
  
**[font=Georgia]

OPTIONAL FILES

[/font]****- Dual Wield Fix:**  Allows the left hand to play the animation when moving.
  
  
[NickaNak](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3127912) fixed this issue in the mod [Extra Drawing Animations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37804)﻿ using Nemesis, I asked about it and was told it was something to do with bone weights. So I edited the behavior files to only include those fixes. NickaNak kindly allowed me to share the edited files here, huge thanks to this awesome person.
  
  
- Install patch.
  
- Run Nemesis;
  
- Tick "Extra Drawing Animations";
  
- Update engine
  
- Launch Nemesis.
  
  
Requires Nemesis.

- **Alternative Animations**: By default, the mod uses most animations from Immersive Animations. This patch will replace some of these animations by using their equivalents from Extra Drawing Animations.
  
  
- Dual wielding swords (at hip);
  
- Dual wielding maces (at hip);
  
- Dual wielding axes (at hip);
  
- Sword at hip and shield on back;
  
- Dagger at hip and shield on back;
  
- Axe at hip and shield on back;
  
- Mace at hip and shield on back.
  
  
They're a bit different than the default animations.

[font=Georgia]**TROUBLESHOOTING**[/font]

All animations can be located at:
  
- Meshes\actors\character\animations\OpenAnimationReplacer\Weapon Styles
  
- Meshes\actors\character\\_1stperson\animations\OpenAnimationReplacer\Weapon Styles
  
  
Folder names should be self explanatory.
  
  
*Q: How to add animations from another mod?*
  
A: You can copy the equip.hkx and unequip.hkx files from the other mods and paste them in the corresponding folders from this mod.
  
  
All animations are played based on what's equipped on the main hand.
  
Vanilla animations list:
  
Spoiler1hm\_equip/unequip.hkx = one-handed sword;
  
2hc\_equip/unequip.hkx = two-handed sword;
  
2hw\_equip/unequip.hkx = two-handed axe/mace;
  
axe\_equip/unequip.hkx = one-handed axe;
  
dag\_equip/unequip.hkx = one-handed dagger;
  
mac\_equip/unequip.hkx = one-handed mace;
  
(sneak)bow\_drawlight/drawheavy = quiver animation (this one is actually when the arrow is being pulled from the quiver, not the bow equip/unequip animation);
  
h2h\_equip/unequip.hkx = unarmed;
  
mrh\_equip/unequip.hkx = magic right hand;
  
staffright\_equip.hkx = animation for staff on the right hand and something other than a staff on the left;
  
stf\_equip.hkx = animation for staves in both hands.
  
P.S.: There is no unequipping animation for staves.
  
  
XPMSSE animations list:
  
SpoilerSome mods will include the XPMSE folder, you can copy, rename and paste these files in the corresponding folders from this mod :
  
  
xpe0\_1hm\_equip/unequip.hkx = one-handed sword dual wield (on hips);
  
xpe1\_1hm\_equip/unequip.hkx = one-handed sword (on back);
  
xpe2\_1hm\_equip/unequip.hkx = one-handed sword dual wield (on back);
  
xpe3\_1hm\_equip/unequip.hkx = one-handed sword(on hip) and shield;
  
xpe4\_1hm\_equip/unequip.hkx = one-handed sword(on back) and dagger(on back hip);
  
  
xpe0\_2hc\_equip/unequip.hkx = two-handed sword (on hip);
  
xpe0\_2hw\_equip/unequip.hkx = two-handed axe/mace (on hip);
  
  
xpe0\_axe\_equip/unequip.hkx = one-handed axe dual wield (on hips);
  
xpe1\_axe\_equip/unequip.hkx = one-handed axe (on back);
  
xpe2\_axe\_equip/unequip.hkx = one-handed axe dual wield (on back);
  
xpe3\_axe\_equip/unequip.hkx = one-handed axe(on hip) and shield (drawing like a sword);
  
xpe4\_axe\_equip/unequip.hkx = one-handed axe(on back) and dagger(on back hip);
  
  
xpe0\_dag\_equip/unequip.hkx = one-handed dagger dual wield (on hips);
  
xpe1\_dag\_equip/unequip.hkx = one-handed dagger (on back hip);
  
xpe2\_dag\_equip/unequip.hkx = one-handed dagger dual wield (on back hip);
  
xpe3\_dag\_equip/unequip.hkx = one-handed dagger (on ankle);
  
xpe4\_dag\_equip/unequip.hkx = one-handed dagger dual wield (on ankles);
  
xpe5\_dag\_equip/unequip.hkx = one-handed dagger (on back hip) and sword (on hip);
  
  
xpe0\_mac\_equip/unequip.hkx = one-handed mace dual wield (on hips);
  
xpe1\_mac\_equip/unequip.hkx = one-handed mace(on hip) and shield (drawing like a sword);
  
  
xpe0\_(sneak)bow\_drawlight/drawheavy = quiver animation (on back hip)
  
  
*Q: Conflicts with XPMSSE?*
  
A: If you fully, or partially, installed XPMSSE and the animations are not working, you can try this:
  
- Open XPMSSE MCM and disable all stuff related to animations.
  
If you don't have access to the MCM, you can try this:
  
- Delete the folders meshes\actors\character\animations and meshes\actors\character\behaviors (from XPMSSE) and run FNIS/Nemesis again.
  
  
*Q: Animations are not playing?*A: If none of the animations are playing, there is probably something wrong with your installation or you are using a mod that changes the default animations.
  
You should check if you have other animation mods installed; such as Weapons on Back. Immersive Animations, Extra Drawing Animations, etc...
  
Won't hurt to check if you have another DAR/OAR mod installed with higher priority or sharing the same folders.
  
  
*Q: Issue with belt fastened quiver and Archery Gameplay Overhaul?*A: AGO changes more animations than the ones provided by this mod.
  
  
You'll need to do some manual patching:
  
1. Delete all contents from folder **Meshes\OpenAnimationReplacer\WS\Qui\Actors\Character\Animations**, except for the **horse\_rider** folder.
  
2. Download optional [Belt fastened quiver](https://www.nexusmods.com/Core/Libs/Common/Widgets/DownloadPopUp?id=85499&game_id=1704&nmm=1) file from AGO.
  
3. Extract all the files from the **Meshes\Actors\Character\Animations** folder, from the file downloaded above to the [size=3]**Meshes\OpenAnimationReplacer\WS\Qui\[size=3][b]Actors\Character\Animations**[/b][/size] folder from Weapon Styles.
  
4. Extract all the files from the **Meshes\Actors\Character\\_1stperson\Animations** [size=3][size=3]folder [/size]from the file downloaded above to the **Meshes\OpenAnimationReplacer\WS\Qui**\**Actors\Character\\_1stperson\Animations** [size=3]folder[/size] from Weapon Styles.[/size]
