**Compatibility** - Compatible with most mods since Version 1.1+
  
  
**Q&A**
  

  
* Q. [color=#ffffff]Is it compatible with X?[/color]
[color=#ffffff]A. I can't answer that because i don't know. You might wanna try it by yourself.[/color]
  

  

  
* Q. Is it okay to install or update the mod mid-playthrough?
A. Yes.
  

  

  
* Q. Is this script-heavy?
A. No. It just one simple script to detect a reanimated npc. You can have a look at the source file. It's kinda embarrassing to call this a script haha.
  

  

  
* Q. Why does this suddenly require SPID and Papyrus Extender?
A. The previous version has issues like animations are applied to non-reanimated & mod incompatibility. I couldn't fix that without po3's mods, since DAR has limited conditions.  If you don't like it, you can stick to old one (1.02). But it's kinda buggy.
  

  
* SPID - For distributing a spell, which has a script attached to it.
Papyrus Extender - For detecting reanimated npcs accurately.
  

  

  
* Q. Why esp?
A. Without a plugin, my script won't work. If you wanna remove the mod mid-playthrough, just delete Reanimated Detector\_DISTR.ini
  
* And delete the rest of the files before you start a new playthrough.

  

  
* Q. Can you make animations more slower?
A. Nope. i don't wanna re-do all the annotations.
  

  

  
* Q. Why DAR?
A. Idk how to make this work with FNIS/Nemesis.
  

  

  
* Q. Attack animation?
A. I don't have enough skills for that. Maybe in the future.
  

  

  
* Q. Reanimated person wouldn't walk like this.
A. I haven't seen one in real life, so it might be inaccurate.
  

  

  
* Q. I don't like certain animation.
A. Get [DAR Explorer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73930?tab=files)﻿ to find the animation you don't like and delete that hkx file.
