Hello, im finaly glad to present you a new dragon animations in Skyrim.
  
The goal of this animation replacer is to make fair attacks for dragons, because in vanilla some attacks are instant (like wing attacks) some attacks are too slow (bite attacks) some attacks are cheesy (get behind dragon and you'll never see his face again because he will be in constant loop of tail grond slams)

Better watch the video of all new attacks
  
  
COMPATABILITY
  
Since it is only a vanilla attacks animation replacear, it is compatable with EVERY mod that changes dragons stats, skeleton, abilities, etc etc.
  
it is also COMPATABLE with Ultimate Dragons, and i replaced parry anim with wing attack.
  
It is also COMPATABLE with Distar dragons (just make a random precent condition)
  
  
UPDATED!
  
  
Added my skeleton.nif changes for dragons, with a little bit bigger wings AND smaller bumper, so you can turn off "disable character bumper" in Precision (highly recomended)
  
With Precision option "disable character bumper" you can actualy just run under dragon witch results in every dragon hits MISSES or TOTALY BROKEN AI (Dragon just dont know what to do with you if you are under him)
