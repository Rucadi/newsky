After I decided to backport [Apples the Dog](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23553/) to LE for my own use, I was inspired to modify the animations where a dog lays down. Consider this a quite delayed tribute to the now gone but not forgotten Kabosu, rest well.
  
  
Edit: Replaced the sitting animation with Cheems' iconic pose as well, by request!
  
  
This also replaces the base dog idle with the wolf one for a more calm look and mouth closed more frequently, except I also removed the annoying breath-growls in hkanno.
