**Q&A**
  

  
* Q. Why does this require DAR?
A. I don't know how to randomize animations with FNIS/Nemesis.
  

  

  
* Q. I don't like certain animation.
A. Get [DAR Explorer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73930?tab=files)﻿ to find the animation you don't like and delete that folder.
  

  

  
* Q. I keep getting same animation over and over.
A. It's randomized. I can't do anything about that.
  

  

  
* Q. Is this compatible with [Skyrim's Got Talent - Bards Reborn Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51740)?﻿
A. ~~I'm waiting for CloudQuest to update his patch for SGT 1.60. My patch will be uploaded later.~~
  

  
* The patch is available.

  

  
* Q. Is this compatible with X animation mod?
A. Probably. I've tested with several mods, it works fine on my end.
  

  

  
* Q. I've found your mod delete the name of magic effects.
A. It has 0 effect and you wouldn't see that effects in game.
  

  

  
* Q. Animations are too slow.
A. I made them faster at first, but it looked too ridiculous.
