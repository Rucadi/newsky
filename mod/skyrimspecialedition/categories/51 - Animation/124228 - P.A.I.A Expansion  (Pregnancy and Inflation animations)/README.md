[font=Trebuchet MS]**Description**[/font]

  
  
[font=Comic Sans MS]I was inspired by P.A.I.A animation.
  
Since it only supports idle motion so I decided to take on the rest of the part for more details.
  
[/font][font=Comic Sans MS]
  
Idle motions for each stage of belly inflation.
  
Walking and Running animation when she is fully inflated.
  
I am going to make more but as I am currently occupied by other projects, for example TNTR and whatnot, it will take time.
  
I will be back soon. Sorry for the poor description. I like creating, not explaining.
  
I don't like being too much explanatory. After all, you know what it is and what to do with it.
  
  
Enjoy![/font]
