**[font=Georgia]INTRODUCTION[/font]**

  

This mod will bring a little immersion when eating ingredients and applying poisons. Different animations will play based on the ingredient eaten or poison applied and the corresponding models will appear on the player's hands during the animations.

**[font=Georgia]Q&A[/font]**
  

**Q: Why use Immersive Interactions as a requirement?**
  
*A: It's a great mod and already adds all that's needed for this mod to work. Plus I don't need to create a new .esp just for this. If you're looking for a standalone mod, you should definitely check out [Animated Poisons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72849) and/or [Animated Ingredients](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72852).*
  
  
**Q: Limitations?**
  
*A: Some items may not match 100% the animations. Poison bottles will have their cork attached, no way of removing it with just IED.*
  
  
**Q: First person?**
  
*A: Version 1.2 and onwards includes first person animations. An animation for applying poisons and a simple animation for  eating ingredients. To display some of the ingredient's models, install this mod: [First Person Interactions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/123129)﻿.*
  
As IED doesn't work in first person, poison and ingredient models need to be manually created.
  
  
**Q: What about this ingredient/poison?**
  
*A: Leave a comment, I might patch it later.*
