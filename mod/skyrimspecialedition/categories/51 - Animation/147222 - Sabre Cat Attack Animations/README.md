**Description:**
  
  
In Vanilla; Sabre Cats hits their target almost instantly, which is not ideal when they deal a ton of damage and you can't even see their attacks coming.
  
This mod replaces all of the vanilla attacks to make them more readable while giving you some window to fight back.
  
(Vale Sabre Cats will use these animations as well)
