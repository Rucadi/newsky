**I don't know if anyone still needs this mod, but in the latest version of TDM, this mod is not needed.
  
  
Do not use any more.
  
  
This is an ancient artifact.**
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
***True Directional Movement and TK Dodge Mod Compatibility Patch***
  
  
  
***2.0 Update note.***
  
  
- Now fully supports both step and roll dodges with and without lock-on.
  
  
- Compatible with **[Sound For TK Dodge SE mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39689)**.
  
  (However, you must use the main file, not the "For True Directional Movement" options file in the **[Sound For TK Dodge SE mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39689)﻿**.)
  
  
  
  
-------------------------------------------------
  
  
  
- Both Roll Dodge and Step Dodge are supported.
  
  
- When lock-on is not used, dodge can be used in front of the player no matter which direction the dodge key is input.
  
  
- When using lock-on, it detects the enchantment of lock-on and uses the existing 4-way dodge.
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
**Installation notes**
  
- Install all Requirements mods.
