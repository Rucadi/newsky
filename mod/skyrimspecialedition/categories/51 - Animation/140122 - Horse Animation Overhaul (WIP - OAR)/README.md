# Horse Animation Overhaul (WIP - OAR)
- Author: mxnedula
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/140122


After about a year of tedious off-and-on working and testing this, I can finally provide y'all with some fresh horse animations to match their riders. Yeeeeehaww
  
  
[font=Courier New]? Requirements:
  
[/font]• None for the main version, it should work out of the box.
  
• If you're using the Thundertrot Movement Patch, you'll need [OAR](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92109) and [@b13nxx](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/b13nxx?gameId=1704)'s [Thundertrot Directional Move](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/140941?tab=files)﻿ file ONLY (not the animations / main file on their page). Load my patch (and the main file of HAO) after the directional movement mod and you're good to go. 
  
• Nothing is required for the extra turn animations, but animations may be redundant unless you have a behavior mod that allows for l/r movement.
  
~~• DAR/OAR if you're using an animation variance version. Keep in mind this mod won't show up in OAR's menu, but that doesn't mean it's not working. This is because I used the DAR folder format, but OAR can read DAR conditions.~~ (Hopefully coming in the future!)
  
  
✍️ [font=Courier New]Update Log:
  
[/font]*1.0 - Initial release*
  
• Contains only most essential animations (idle, walk, trot, lope, gallop, and left + right turn animations).
  
  
*2.0 - Major Update (working on getting screenshots/media previews)*• Added new jump animations. Horses also jump a little higher so you have some hope to make it over logs, rocks, and other obstacles sometimes. Physics can still be awkward but overall I think everything flows much better.
  
• Significantly improved base movement animations (walk, trot, lope, gallop). Trot animations in particular have gotten a ton of tweaking, and gallop animations have been completely rebuilt (honestly I'm kinda embarrassed about the last ones now). Of course, turn animations have also been updated to make things seamless (excluding walk which is only available in extra turn animation optional file).
  
• I'm aiming to make Skyrim horses a bit more expressive/lifelike instead of looking so static, so I've added some more movement in the head, jaw, and ear areas.
  
• More saddle bone bone fixes that made things look wonky.
  
• [RAO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/102881) will also be updated with matching and much improved rider animations (with leaning during turns) soon. 
  
  
  
[font=Courier New]❗Recommendations / Mods featured in (1.0) screenshots & GIFs / Credits:
  
[/font]Pair this with my other mod, [Riding Animation Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/102881), for a smoother overall riding experience (I think ?). I'll be providing an optional file containing turn animations for riders there soon as well.
  
A big thanks to [@b13nxx](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/b13nxx?gameId=1704) for sharing their optional directional movement file on their [Thundertrot animation modpage](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/140941).  I wanted to do something similar to this so I've provided a patch for those who'd like to use their file (requires the original download and it's requirements, I simply made an overwrite with my own animations).
  
Tack used is from (the fabulous) [ZZjay's Horse Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63640)﻿.
  
A final thanks to [@DServant](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/DServant?gameId=110) for [Horses Revamped](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/70640)! I've been able to learn a lot about behavior thanks to their mod. 
  
  
  
  
  
[font=Courier New]? Notes/Content features:
  
[/font]• Safe to install/uninstall midgame. No Nemesis/Pandora generation required. If you're experiencing a bug, it's most likely caused by something else since this replaces vanilla content, but I'm open to concerns.
  
• **This one's important****--****Updated left & right turn animations**: If you're using just the main file, your horse will bend it's upper body and neck when turning only while in a trot or lope (because for some reason Bethesda didn't add left & right animations for walking or galloping). However, gallop/sprint left & right movement support is available with Thundertrot Directional Move Patch and it's requirements. I've also provided my walk and gallop turn animations in an optional file so that they're accessible if you use something like a [Horses Revamped](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/70640) port. *I'll probably work on my own behavior changes regarding this in the future for ease of use, but for now these are my best solutions.*
  
• Extensive improvements to animations to make everything smoother and more realistic, including floppy ears. ?
  
• The vanilla trot animation(s) in particular had some major inconsistencies with the "SaddleBone" bone. This bone's movement caused the character to be pretty oddly aligned (to match the horse's body being extremely slanted). I've adjusted things so that the rider legs should be mirrored as intended if you use [RAO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/102881), and the horse is far more symmetrical. I can't make any promises for the vanilla riding animations given they might have compensated for the Saddlebone placement, so you'll just have to give it a shot. In addition, I'll probably adjust that particular bone in future updates to make things as smooth as possible.
  
• To preview these animations, please view the GIFs in the media section (I know they're not ideal but I tried ok ?). I've provided previews from blender as well as in-game with [Review Studio](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29357) (such a handy little tool for me, thank you!) since the ground is completely flat. With those you can see what the animations look like without any influence from terrain.  On that note- please keep in mind that with the way Skyrim physics behave (particularly regarding collisions / bones), it's impossible to have no clipping and/or hooves in the correct position at all times. Trust me, I don't like it either. I recommend using [Horse Behaviour Improvements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/113535)﻿, it's lightweight and a nice tweak.
  
• I haven't done much testing with horse and tack replacers so far, but given this was reanimated with the vanilla horse model, most replacers should look ok as long as they retain a similar body shape / skeleton. 
  
• Thank you so much to [@Albus961](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Albus961?gameId=1704) for all the unconditional support you gave while I was working on this project! You ultimately helped me figure out how to edit and export everything by keeping me motivated. Go show them some love!
  
  
  
  
As always, thanks for the visit and reading, hope you enjoy the mod. ♥
  
Safe travels!
