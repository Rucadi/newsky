First off all, **I'm not an animator**,
  
these were made with [permission](https://i.imgur.com/lltuCTq.png)﻿,
  
from [**Gunslicers**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5032776)﻿ animations,
  
picking animations from GS Poses mod (not at Nexus).

This mod adds dynamic random **non-combat** **unarmed** **idle animations** (by default) for **female Player**.
  
  
(**Read sticky post regarding male support**)

Basically these play when unarmed (both hands) is **"equipped" and "drawn out"**.
  
and you are **not in combat**.
  
  
There is own animations for non-sneak (6 standing idles),
  
and for sneak (11 on the floor idles).
  
  
Will not overwrite basic idles.
  
  
When **you enter combat, your other installed unarmed idle animations will take over.**

You can use the OAR in-game UI to turn off certain anims, etc,
  
or even temporarily turn the mod off if you wish so, by making own user configs.

As stated before, animations used are [Gunslicers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5032776)﻿ (nexus link) animations,
  
to be more precise: "GSPoses"-mod (external site)
  
that has hundreds of poses, highly recommend you to search it up and try it out.
  
GS also has bunch of other animation mods worth checking out, and a Patreon.

Not much to say really, it's a quick little mod just for fun.
