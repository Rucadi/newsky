**A Dynamic Animation Replacer
  
 mod that will add new simple animations to humanoid NPCs affected by fear.**
  
  
New animations will appear on humanoid NPCs when they are affected by these spells/conditions:
  
**Fear magic spells
  
Fear weapon enchantments
  
Werewolf howl of terror
  
Dismay shout
  
Nord battle cry**If you think i forgot about a possible condition let me know in the posts!Many animations are included, unique gender idles, weapon idles, sprinting, running, walking etc
  
  
  
  
  
Installation
  
1- Download and install Dynamic Animation Replacer
  
2- Download and extract this mod and copy it to your data folder
  
If this DAR folder number "2020" already exists in your \_CustomConditions
  
folder, just simply rename it to something else close to that number, i
  
picked it for ironic reasons, don't replace a folder you already have!
