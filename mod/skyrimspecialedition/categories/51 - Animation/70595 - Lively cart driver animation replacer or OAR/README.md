Credits:
  
Huge kudos to [tktk1](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3841389) for keeping [Animation Tools N3+28](http://onedrive.live.com/?id=9C43AA9F34AE59F6!1629&cid=9C43AA9F34AE59F6) available for aspiring animators like me and to all modders created and improved this animation setup :)
  
  
How to learn animating characters in Blender:
  
Download [Blender](https://www.blender.org/download/), a copy of [Animation Tools N3+28](http://onedrive.live.com/?id=9C43AA9F34AE59F6!1629&cid=9C43AA9F34AE59F6) and watch on youtube [this playlist of tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLob5if7zamETyG5baFdESe-z3tFALkYT5) I've collected. Exported .hkx animations will be in LE format, so you also will need [Cathedral Assets Optimizer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23316) to convert it to SE (or it won't play in SE version of the game). 
  
  
Subtle hint:
  
If you see value in what I do, please consider supporting my modding endeavors on my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/CHIMgarden) or on [buymeacoffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/CHIMgarden) 
  
It will give me more time to make new animations out of motion capture and you will have it in your game much sooner!
