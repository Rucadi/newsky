[font=Verdana]❖ FAQ ❖[/font]
  
[font=Arial]Q: Is it compatible with X?
  
A: Should be compatible with everything, but if not - tell me about it
  
  
Q: You said that you changed every animation, but you actually forgot X!
  
A: If it's not sprint, or sneak attacks - then yeah, i forgot, tell me about it! 
  
  
Q: Attacks are not realistic, this doesn't look like HEMA at all!
  
A: As i said - i needed to maintain balance between realism and satisfying animations, ofc you wouldn't swing this slow and wide in real sword fight, but this is just a game.
  
  
Q: Camera movement makes me motion-sick
  
A: Sad to hear this, but i won't do anything about this, because it will require A LOT of VERY boring work from me.
  
  
Q: I don't like something!
  
A: Sad to hear this, but i also won't do anything about this (if it's not a bug). Blender is free, you can make anims yourself.

[font=Arial][Precision](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72347) - for accurate hit timings, my mod would work without it, but some attacks would have *slight* desync between animation and actual hit
  
[Stances](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40484)﻿ - yeah, yeah, i told you 100 times already, but my mod fits perfectly with this one
  
[AMR](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50258)﻿ - for custom movement in power attacks
