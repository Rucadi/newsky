? Billyy's Animations for OStim Standalone ?
  
  
Hey there, Skyrim adventurers! ?
  
  
First of all, all credits for these amazing animations go to Billyy and his original [mod for SexLab](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/3999-billyys-slal-animations-2023-10-6/). This is simply a port to make everything work with the **OStim Standalone** framework.
  
  
⚠️ Important Notes ⚠️
  
• This mod **requires Pandor or Nemesis** to function properly
  
• Unlike native OStim animation packs, these ported animations from SexLab are typically series that make sense to play one after another in manual mode
  
• All furniture-spawning animations are excluded from OStim's auto play mode (to avoid random furniture appearing in caves!)
  
  
? What's Included? ?
  
  
**? Compatible Animation Modules:**
  
This pack doesn't include already ported furniture packs from Drei:
  
• [Billyy Wall Pack for OStim Standalone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/101838)
  
• [Billyy Table Pack for OStim Standalone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99907)
  
• [Billyy Chair and Bench Pack for OStim Standalone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98803)
  
If you want those animations too, make sure to install them separately! ?
  
  
**?️ Billyy's Animations for OStim - Spawned Furniture** added 10/22/2023
  
• ~49 animation scenes
  
• Includes animations with spawned furniture (not always immersive - like an alchemy workbench in a cave ?)
  
• Only includes opposite sex animations
  
• All animations are disabled from OStim's auto mode
  
• Actor combinations: F, FM and FMM
  
  
**? Billyy's Animations for OStim - Adapted Furniture** added 11/29/2023
  
• Same animations as **Spawned Furniture**, but adapted to regular OStim furniture (chairs, tables, etc.)
  
• Some animations couldn't be adapted (gloryhole shack, furotub)
  
• ⚠️ Choose either Adapted OR Spawned modules - having both doesn't make sense as animations are the same

**? Billyy's Animations for OStim - Group**
  
• ~149 animation scenes
  
• All animations for 3+ actors (F + multiple M)
  
• Doesn't include multiple F and M combinations (that will be in another module)
  
  
? How to Navigate? ?
  
  
Everything starts from OStim scenes. Here's a map showing which Billyy's hubs you can reach from OStim scenes.
  
  
When you see something like **BillyysHumanFfmHub**, it means:
  
• **Billyys** - Name of the author
  
• **Human** - Name of the animation module
  
• **Ffm** - Actor combination (f = female, m = male)
  
• **Hub** - A folder containing animations
  
  
Some hubs with many animations will have pages (sub-hubs).

Inside each animation sequence, you can use the **Next**, **Back**, and **Return** buttons:
  
• **Next** ➡️ - Proceed to next scene
  
• **Back** ⬅️ - Go back to previous scene
  
• **Return** ? - Exit animation sequence and return to hub/page
  
  
The last-but-one scene in a sequence usually has the climax scene, which can be reached with the Next button or when an actor enters the climax state.

? Swaps/Rotation Actors in Scenes ?
  
  
**NEW FEATURE!** For all scenes with 2+ actors of the same gender, you can now **rotate positions**! ?
  
  
For example, in an FFFM scene, you can change positions of female actors clockwise:
  
• F0 takes F1's position
  
• F1 takes F2's position
  
• F2 takes F0's position
  
  
This feature is available through:
  
• FOMOD installer option ✅
  
• Separate Miscellaneous file download (only for version 3.1.0, but you will have manually remove folders of modules you aren't using, for example if you selected during FOMOD installation before Spawned Furniture after installing this file you'll have to go and remove "BillyysAdapted", or if you installed only Orgy module you will have to remove everything except "BillyysOrgy")
  
  
⚙️ How does it work?
  
Unfortunately, OStim doesn't have functionality to dynamically change actors' positions during scenes. As a workaround, I created additional JSON scenes for each combination - which significantly increases the number of scenes (but **not** the animation count!)
  
  
These additional scenes actually **re-use existing animations**. How does this impact your gameplay? Each time a mod or OStim in auto-mode searches for particular scenes, these scenes with swap/rotation will have more chances to be picked. Again, it doesn't increase the actual animation count - just gives you more control over actor positioning! ?
  
  
  
? Body Compatibility ?
  
  
First, follow the [OStim Standalone guide](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/5654) to properly set up all required mods.
  
  
For actor alignment, I used:
  
• **BHUNP zeroed slider** for females
  
• **HIMBO full SOS with RaceMenu** for males (RaceMenu genitals slider at 1.3)
  
  
I won't be updating animation files as I don't have the skills for that. ?
  
  
There's no way to support all different body presets and SOS sizes/types, so you might see some misalignment or clipping. Use OStim's built-in alignment tool for the best experience!
  
  
? Special Thanks ?
