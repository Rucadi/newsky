# Goetia Animations - Enchanted Magic Staves
- Author: Verolevi
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71110
This pack will replace the following animations:
  
  
-The idle, walk, run and sprint while wielding Staves.
  
-The staff equip, and unequip with either/both hands.
  
-All idles and movements while aiming any staff.
  
-Casting with any staff with any hand configuration.
  
  
[size=3]Can be used for hybrid staff+melee or staff+spell playstyles, and are designed to transition into, and blend well with, some of my previously released mods, though this can still be used as standalone with varying transition/blending results.
  
  
With heavy focus on gameplay consistency, and as is the case with my previously released ranged animations, the character will now keep facing the same direction while aiming with staves and moving, without any jitter, including when aiming from one hand while holding a weapon in the other.
  
  
The animations apply to the PC and NPC alike.

Questions unrelated to this mod regarding the previews are most likely answered in their video descriptions.
  
  
Note that the optional animations are designed for destruction staves, [that use this model](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Destruction_Staff_(Skyrim)), while the character is exploring/out of combat.
  
  
  
Requirement

* [size=4][size=3][size=3][size=3][size=3][size=3][size=3]While main file only uses [Dynamic Animation Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33746)﻿, [size=3][size=3]or [Open Animation Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92109)﻿ (recommended for future proofing), [/size]as a soft requirement to reduce instances of clipping and provide better animation blending, the optional files do rely on it as a core requirement to only trigger during exploration.[/size][/size][/size][/size][/size][/size][/size][/size]
