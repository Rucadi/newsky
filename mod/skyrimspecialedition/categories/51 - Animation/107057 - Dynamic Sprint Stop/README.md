***please refer to this***
  
- I believe that the feeling of use is as important as the movement, so I made it so that it does not work during battle. It seemed like an unnecessary movement during combat.
  
- Most weapons not included in the video, such as crossbows and others, are supported, but only staff are not supported.
  
  
  
  
**This is not an essential mod, but it is recommended.**
