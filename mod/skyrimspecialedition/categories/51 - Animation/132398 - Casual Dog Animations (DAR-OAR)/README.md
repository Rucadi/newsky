This mods adds some new animations to dogs via Dynamic/Open Animation Replacer, where I may have heavily edited some vanilla animations in Blender, with my own touch (or using the amateur skills I have to try and re-animate).
  
  
Casual:
  

  
* Head-tilting (replaces barking with a 33% chance)
Yawning (replaces barking with a ~~10~~ 3% chance)
  
* Paw-grooming (replaces lay-down transition with a ~~10~~ 3% chance)
Some happily wagging tail animations (with a 50% chance)
  

  
Pro-tip: You don't need to have the plugin enabled if the new sounds bother you x'D
  
  
Playful:
  

  
* Rolling over on back (replaces lay-down transition with a 10% chance)
Chasing tail (replaces the scratching oneself with a 10% chance)
  

  
**Recommended mods:

**Installation:**
  
Just install the way you would've installed any other mod, preferably with a mod manager like Vortex or MO2. Manually download the archive and drag-and-drop it into the application. Then enable the plugin.
