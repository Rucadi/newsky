This is a animation replacer for Ritho and other Tower giants in Vigilant. Requires DAR.
  
  
  
  
  
I wanted them to act like a civilized knight, not a wild animals.(I like vanilla giant animations though.)
  
  
  
I need help.
  
I changed Vanilla's weapon swing attack motion to a thrust attack(attack1.hkx and attack1x2.hkx), but sometimes it is replaced and sometimes it is not.
  
I don't know why. I want only my animations to be played for Ritho. to prevent clipping.
