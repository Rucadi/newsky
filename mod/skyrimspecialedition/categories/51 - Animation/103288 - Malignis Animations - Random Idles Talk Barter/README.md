Community reviews for my first mod inspired me a lot. Thank you all guys and girls.
  
I spent a crazy amount of time and effort creating this mod. So I hope that you will like and appreciate the work I have done.

 **﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿My personal recommendations of mods (just to see what I see in game):**
  
[True Directional Movement](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51614)[﻿SmoothCam](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41252)[﻿SmoothCam - Galuna's Preset](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78397)
  
[Dragonborn Voice Over](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/84329) ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿- to allow the player to voice over the dialogue lines
  
**[Improved Alternate Conversation Camera](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68210)** ﻿- to see your caracter face in dialogue
  
[Skyrim Souls RE - Updated](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27859) ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿   - to unpause the game while in barter menu
  
**[Animation Queue Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/82395)** ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿     - Fixes the queue getting overloaded when a lot of animations are queued for loading at the same time
  
Other recommendations:
  
For those who use TDM Headtracking, I recommend disable "Head Tracking Affects Spine" option to prevent animation overlapping. At the moment, barter animations suffer the most from this, even if only the head is tracked. I hope this problem will be solved in the future.
  
  

**Preview:
  
The preview is very long, I think I managed to show most of the animations. I hate video editing and design. Please be patient and use timecodes.**

  

**[Malignis Animations - Conditions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/132028)﻿** (to complement this mod)

"Malignis\_Base" Preset**Use the fairly simple OAR in-game UI if you want to specify which characters will use the animations from the mod. All females, Player Character Only, Companions or children.
