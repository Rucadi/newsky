[Nemesis](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60033) is **required** for this to work, without it you may experience t-poses at best or crashes at worst.

  

Use [Undeath - Classical Lichdom](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40802) and it's requirements for the best possible experience. ﻿

  

Make sure to load this below Undeath if using it. Otherwise the righthand self-casting will not as intended. ﻿

  
  
**What this mod does**This mod aims to overhaul and enhance dragon priest behaviour while also fixing old bugs and visual inconsistencies.
  
  
**Features**
  

  
* "Unlocks" the spell casting
Fixes long-standing bugs
  
* Rudimentary sprinting behaviour

  
**Unlocked casting**
  
By unlocked casting I refer to the ability to cast or charge a spell in one hand while already using a spell in the other hand. This was not possible in vanilla which I felt was a big limitation for any combat as a dragon priest. 
  
  
**Fixed bugs**
  
The left hand fire and forget animation would force the spell to be shot and cycle through different animations when charging too long. 
  
The right hand self-cast fire and forget spell now uses the correct animation. 
  
The dual self-cast animation would interrupt itself causing the spell to never be fired and the animation to loop in one specific place. 
  
  
**Sprinting behaviour**
  
The sprinting behaviour is currently described as rudimentary because it only works while sheathing your hands. This will change in the future.
