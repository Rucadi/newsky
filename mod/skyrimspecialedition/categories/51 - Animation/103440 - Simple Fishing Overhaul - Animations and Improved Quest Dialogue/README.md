~Simple Fishing Overhaul
  
~AKA Third Person Animations for Fishing~
  
~AKA Its NOT all in this note~

  
  
I thought if I waited long enough, someone would add third person animations to the fishing so I could finally fish properly. It's been two years... Exactly two years since the fishing addon released. Nothing. Zip. Nada! Not even oFishing!
  
  
 I had to learn how to animate using blender to make this mod. 2/10 experience, I do not recommend. Also, while I was at it, I decided to improve the quest dialogue. Enjoy!
  
  
Features:
  

  
* Fish in third person or in first person. Your choice! Or mix it!
You can now move the camera around while in first person.
  
* Around 200 new lines of dialogue. See below.
The quest dialogue has been partially improved. What this means is that most of the generic lines "It's all in this note" and "How can I argue with that?" have been changed to other things that add a bit more context and personality to the quests, so it doesn't feel like you're talking to a robot. This is NOT a quest expansion per se though, the quests are the same, only the dialogue is partially improved.
  
* NPCs will sometimes react to your fishing rod, if you have it equipped.
Some NPCs and followers will react to your fishing. Followers might encourage you or tell you how tired they are of your fishing. Random people might ask how the fishing is going and if you caught anything good. Immersion!
  
* I've added "bait requirement" as a new (optional) feature. Fishing will require having one of the common ingredients classified as "bait" in your inventory.These are ingredients that make sense, are quite common and inexpensive. Small insects (like bees, torchbugs or butterfly wings), slaughterfish or spider eggs, some animal parts and even some small fish are all suitable as bait. The ingredient will automatically be consumed when starting to fish and does not impact the fishing itself. I'm hoping bait brings a tiny bit of balance to fishing by adding a small "cost" to this activity. If you don't like this feature, you can disable it from the MCM.
With *Bait Requirement* enabled, activating a fishing basket for the first time will grant you a few bait ingredients. (2-7 common ingredients that can be used for fishing). This is done so you are never "locked" out of fishing when you first find a new fishing spot, it also rewards exploration and it further differentiates the vanilla fishing basket from "fishing anywhere". Win-win-win!
  
* MCM so you can configure things to your liking.
Compatible with most popular fishing QoL mods.

Requirements:
  
- Official Fishing Addon (Free CC plugin)
  
- OAR / DAR
  
  
**Compatibility:**The mod is compatible with all the most popular Fishing CC submods (see below). The only thing to watch out for: If you are using custom races or your character has an unusual height, the rod might not align with their hands. The animation will continue to look good from behind though and you can tweak the height of the rod if needed.
  
  
- For additional bait ingredients from other mods, get the [FLM patch by Mura](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/104569).
  
- **[Streamlined Fishing](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80683)**: Compatible.
  
**-**[Fish Anywhere With Water](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60915)**:**Compatible. However the rod might be a bit misaligned sometimes in regards to the hand.
  
**- [Improved Camera SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93962):** I recommend disabling "Events -> Scripted" if you want to fish in first person. 
  
- [FK's Diverse Racial Skeletons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38563?tab=files): Compatible via patch. I just adjust the height at which the fishing rod spawns to match the big bois and short kings.
  
- **[True Directional Movement](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51614):** Compatible. Headtracking will temporarily disable itself during fishing. Make sure you update to the latest version and you've enabled Ersh's "strongly recommended" headtracking fix as part of TDM.

**- ESL flagged? Safe to install mid-game?**Yes.
  
  
**- These animations are bad and you should feel bad!**I'd rather have these animations than ONLY first person. If you don't like them, you're always welcome to make your own. Also, how dare you. [HOW. DARE. YOU!](https://media.tenor.com/YQxrDf20KZQAAAAd/sasha-banks-hold-me-back.gif) I had to learn ~~rocket science~~ blender to make this mod. Shame on you!
  
  
**- The character is following the camera around and the rod is off-sync with the hand!**Ersh updated True Directional Momvement earlier this week, please update to the latest version.
  
  
**- I'm using a custom race or a mod with crazy body proportions and the rod is not aligning with my characters hand. Oh no, the horror!**It can happen. It's not a huge deal, as you will mostly see your character fishing from behind and it will look fine even then. But if you want to adjust it perfectly, the position of the rod can be adjusted with an offset value. This can be adjusted in the MCM. Just note, the changes only apply when you start fishing, not during fishing. Also: lower numbers means the rod spawns HIGHER, not lower.
  
  
**- Why did you add the bait thing? I HATE IT!!**The vanilla fishing mini-game is quite uninspired. You press E, you wait, you press E again. Repeat until the end of time and Alduin devours us all. At least now you will have to stop fishing and go butterfly hunting from time to time. If you don't like the feature, disable it from the MCM.
  
  
**- Did you use AI to do these voices?**No, I just reused vanilla voices, similar to what Bethesda did. It sounds more natural because different sentences were put together. The main problem with the vanilla aproach is that the lines are short and always the same (*It's all in this note*) so it ends up being super repetitive and robotic. This should no longer be the case with this mod.
  
  
**- What about a full expansion for the fishing quests? Pretty pwease?**
  
You want an answer? It's all in this note:
  
Spoiler I will leave a proper quest expansion for this quest to other mod authors - The Fishing DLC deserves a full-on revoiced approach in my opinion, with new voice actors and better flow. Until we have that, I think my improved vanilla dialogue will have to do for now.
