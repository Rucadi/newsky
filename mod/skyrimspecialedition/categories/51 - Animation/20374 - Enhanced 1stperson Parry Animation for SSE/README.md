This will replace first person parry animation for all melee weapon, onehanded, twohanded and dual wield. Unlike vanilla this mod will make player do 3 variation of parrying moves while blocking, except dual wield. This will enhances the feels that we deflect incoming attack and push it away instead of taking the hit willingly. Also feels like enemy really "chasing" you, not targeting same exact point of player weapon all the time. This mod also change block bash and power bash for onehanded, dual wield and greatsword with stabbing moves, [size=3]requires Power Bash perk skill tree. Stabbing bash for onehanded and dual wield separated in its own folder because vanilla shared this animation with mace and axe.
