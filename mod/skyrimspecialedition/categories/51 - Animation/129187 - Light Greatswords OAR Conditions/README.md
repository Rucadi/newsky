This mod modifies the OAR conditions in [black364](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5114370)'s light greatswords moveset to match the weapon keyword in [everflame](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/861313)'s light greatswords mod, so only weapons with light greatsword keyword will play light greatswords animations, and normal greatswords will now play normal greatswords animations.
  
  
The conditions are:
  
1. If you are wielding two light greatswords (by the Dynamic Grip mod), then dual wielding animations from [black364](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5114370)'s moveset should be played;
  
2. If you are wielding shield and light greatsword, then 1H animation should be played;
  
3. If you only have a light greatsword on right hand, then 2H animation should be played.
  
  
The above conditions are almost same as original, except that they requires light greatswords rather than all kinds of greatswords, and I modified the DW condition to require two light greatswords rather than a light greatsword and any other weapon.
  
  
To install this mod, just let this mod overwrite the condition files in [black364](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5114370)'s light greatswords moveset mod.
  
  
If somebody needed, I will make another version of conditions which works better with Dynamic Grip, since the current one only play 1H animations when you are wielding a shield.
