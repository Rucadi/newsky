* You can move while equipping/unequipping your armors.
Except when you are wearing boots. Why? It doesn't make sense.

**Follower Support (Experimental)**

  
* Follower animations are turned off by default.

  
* When changing follower's outfit via inventory trade, Followers can play boots equipping anim even if you give them weapons. There's nothing i can do.

  
**Known Issues**
  

  
* Shields can penetrate your character's face in some animations. Get [Simple Dual Sheath](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50049) or something similar to place shields on back.

  
* Sometimes equipping animations can be interrupted if you are using idle animation mods, but no big deal.

  
**Q&A**
  

  
* Q. It's not working, you liar!

  
* A. Maybe you don't install requirements or use modded armors with different slot mask and keywords.
Check the [slot mask](https://www.creationkit.com/index.php?title=Biped_Object)﻿ and keyword of the armor in SSEdit or More Informative Console.
  
* See if they have right one. **Cuirass - 32** slot, **Gloves - 33** slot, **Boots - 37** slot, **Necklace - 35** slot, **Helmet/Hood - ArmorHelmet/ClothingHead** keyword.

  

  
* Q. LE?
**A. LE Version is [here.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/113607)**
  

  

  
* Q. Is this script heavy?
A. Script only fires when your character equips an armor. I don't think it's heavy.
  

  

  
* Q. Why don't you use DAR?
A. DAR hasn't been updated to the latest version of AE yet. I just want to support both SE and AE.
  
* Although i'm going to make a DAR version after i ensure that there are no critical bugs.

  

  
* Q. Can you add animations for equipping X? I'll wait until you add them.

  
* A. I'm focusing on bug fix at this moment.

  

  
* Q. Can you make a sexy version of this mod?
A. Unfortunatley, i don't have any talent for that.
  

  

  
* Q. Your animations are bad.
A. Tell me which one is bad and why.
  
* Or you can just replace animations. They are placed in meshes\actors\character\animations\IEA folder.

  

  
* Q. My character is T-posing!
A. Give your PC some time to load all the animations you installed.
