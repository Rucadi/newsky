**THE COMPANIONS**
  
Vilkas, Farkas, and Aela... your truest friends in the Companions, and you've probably married at least one of them at some point. This mod assigns some unique animations to make your werewolf besties feel a bit more special. Includes idles, walk, run/sprint, archery, blocking, and two-handed swordsmanship.
  
  
**THE NIGHTINGALES**
  
Brynjolf and Karliah... the dynamic duo blessed by Nocturnal, helping my good-aligned characters make bad decisions since 2011. This mod gives them some unique animations to make their moves stand out from the crowd. Includes idles, walk, run/sprint, 1-handed and dual wield attacks, dagger equip, bows, crossbows, sneaking, and sitting depending on the character.
  
  
**THE** ~~NEREVARINE~~ **MERCENARY**
  
Teldryn Sero. The man, the myth, the sarcastic legend. He is the drama, and this mod gives him some unique animations. Includes spellsword-style combat animations, idles, sit, walk/run/sprint.
  
  
**THE WARRIOR WOMEN**
  
Uthgerd the Unbroken and Mjoll the Lioness will now move like the heavily armored badasses they are. Right now this file only modifies walk, run, and sprint. Still in development so quite limited in scope but it does work.
  
  
This mod works with either Open Animation Replacer or Dynamic Animation Replacer. It is not necessary to use FNIS or Nemesis/Pandora for this mod, but it is perfectly fine to use them at the same time for your other mods that require it.
  
  
I plan release an AIO file once Warrior Women (WIP) and Serana (unreleased) are finished.
