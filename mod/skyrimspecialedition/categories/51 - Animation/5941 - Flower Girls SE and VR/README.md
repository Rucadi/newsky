**Flower Girls SE and VR version**
  
*[Version for 32bit Skyrim now available.. does not use SKSE](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/81241/?)*
  
  
Provides adult themed content for the dragonborn. In a world beset by violence, Flower Girls aims to share love. It can be considered an all-in-one solution for those looking for both lighthearted entertainment, or the immersion of giving your character an active love life.
  
  
Currently just six new working girl NPC's are introduced to the game, they are basic default NPC additions at the moment... they work from all the major cities. 2 in Riften, 1 in Whiterun, 1 in Markarth, 1 in Solitude and 1 in Windhelm.
  
  
*Warning and Disclaimer:*
  
FlowerGirls SE is intended for adults. Whilst we hope that nobody will find any content provided in this mod to be obscene, there is the possibility to cause offence or distress to either the player or those within hearing or visual distance to the PC. Please be considerate and mindful of those around you, that might not share your opinion of what is offensive and what isn't. Dialogue can be considered suggestive and the animations depict sexual scenes. No responsibility will be entertained by the creator of this mod should you choose not to follow this warning. Installation of this mod is acceptance that you do so at your own discretion. 
  
  
Mod Features:
  
  

  
* Super light-weight mod. No running scripts unless during animation.
Customised voices for the most common voice-types (encompassing most basic female NPC's).
  
* Several uniquely voiced characters such as Serana and Frea have customised voice dialogue.
Humorous and adult themed dialogue.
  
* Large variety of Animations by the talented Leito, M2M, SirNibbles, Billyy, MilkyTabboo and RohZima.
Built for Skyrim SE from scratch.
  
* Bewitching Spell to allow most adult NPC's to earn a bit of extra gold ;-)
Fornicate Spell.. think of yourself as cupid.
  
* Encourages followers to be more... forthcoming with their.. affections.
Turns wife or husband into an insatiable nymphomaniac, really.. yes really.
  
* Six NPC Flower Girls with customised AI packages.
Beggars desperation levels have been increased.
  
* Lover's comfort now optionally animated.
Seduction system to immerse yourself in a world of love.
  
* MCM Menu and hotkey control (if SKSE64/SkyUI is installed).
Integration with the excellent OSA/Osex mod.
  

  
  
  
  
  
  
Compatibility and Requirements:
  
  
Firstly.. VERY IMPORTANT: Requires FNIS v 7.0 (or greater). Please be sure to run FNIS after installing Flower Girls.
  
  
No world edits aside from placing NPC's and no external asset use, so should be compatible with everything.
  
  
[XP32 Maximum Skeleton Extended for SE](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1988/?) - Am now listing this is as a pre-requisite. Many animations, nude bodies depend or work best with the excellent XPMSSE skeleton. Please ensure that you are using the latest XPMSSE version and it has priority in your mod installation order.
  
  
*Killable Children - Just a warning here*. The Killable Children mod fundamentally alters game mechanics by changing children to be seen as adults by the game engine. This circumvents multiple checks in FG to prevent dialogue or animations occurring with child actors. Unfortunately there is not a whole lot I can do about these sweeping and fundamental changes to the core game mechanics. I strongly advise not running FlowerGirls SE if you use that mod.
  
  
**Birds of Skyrim -** Flower Girls requires papyrus to respond reliably and predictably to script events. Birds of Skyrim is incompatible with that requirement due to demands it places on the papyrus engine. Please do not use Flower Girls SE with Birds of Skyrim, results will be strange and unreliable behaviour. 
  
  
FlowerGirls SE will make use of SKSE64, SkyUI and PapyrusUtil SE if they are available on your system. These are NOT a requirement, some features however require them so it's beneficial to have them installed.
  
  
Skyrim VR Users:
  
  
FlowerGirls is now compatible with Skyrim VR. During scenes involving the player actor, a temporary clone is used. Think of it as like an out-of-body experience. This is close to the normal experience of using 3rd person view in Skyrim SE. Please note a couple of details, on occasion your clone might use the 'throw voice' ability. This is bethesda's code and I am not entirely sure if it can be prevented without further experimentation. Any equipment shown on your clone may also not match what you are actually wearing at the time the scene was begun.
  
  
Recommendations:
  
  
Whilst not required, a nude body replacement for both males and females is highly recommended. This mod uses which ever your currently installed bodies are. Schlongs of Skyrim Light works in SE with some conversion. Really helpful guide below by n0mad23:
  
  
Spoiler**Use with Schlongs of Skyrim Light**
  
  
Flower Girls SE utilizes SoS Light's (or SoS Full) ability to configure male's members for correct penetration alignment Although it's not necessary to install Schlongs of Skyrim Light to use Flower Girls SE, it's nevertheless recommended to use Flower Girls SE's full potential.
  
  
Schlongs of Skyrim is available by searching google.
  
  
Because SoS Light has not been converted to SE, the animation files MUST BE CONVERTED for penis alignment to work correctly.
  
  
Without converting SoS's .hkx files the male PC and all nude male npcs will have perpetual 90 degree erections. Converting the .hkx files will cancel this permanent erection glitch.
  
  
To convert SoS Light's .hkx files several additional tools and steps are required.
  
  
First download and install Skyrim Special Edition Creation Kit found here:
  
  
[http://download.cdp....ncher\_Setup.exe](http://download.cdp.bethesda.net/BethesdaNetLauncher_Setup.exe)
  
  
Next download dnalloh1987's convertoskyrimse.bat on his Guide to Animation.hkx conversion for Skyrim Special Edition page located here: [http://www.nexusmods...ion/mods/2970/?](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2970/?)
  
  
Unzip and place convertoskyrimse.bat in the Skyrim\Tools\HavokBehaviorPostProcess folder (not necessary, but it's convenient to have the .bat and the HavokBehaviorPostProcess.exe file located in the same folder).
  
  
Next unzip Schlongs of Skyrim Light onto your desktop or other preferred location. Open the unpacked SoS Light folder and navigate to and open "00 Common", then "meshes", then "auxbones", then "SOS".
  
  
Now open your "Skyrim\Tools\HavokBehaviorPostProcess" folder and copy both HavokBehaviorPostProcess.exe and convertoskyrimse.bat. Paste these into your open "00 Common\meshes\auxbones\SOS\" folder. Double click "convertoskyrimse.bat" then delete "convertoskyrimse.bat" and "HavokBehaviorPostProcess.exe" when the batch conversion has finished. Paste both .bat and .exe files into each of the sub-folders located here, double click the .bat and delete the .bat and .exe afterward.
  
  
The updated .hkx file dates indicate that conversion has been successful.
  
  
After all .hkx files have been converted, rezip SoS Light and install with the Mod Organizer of your choice.

Changing size of Schlong: Really helpful guide below by the legendary Vyxenne:
  
  
SpoilerYou can adjust the size of schlongs by editing your default skeleton, which is probably XPMSSE ![](https://forums.nexusmods.com/public/style_emoticons/dark/thumbsup.gif), or maybe the less-capable one ![](https://forums.nexusmods.com/public/style_emoticons/dark/sad.gif) provided by SOS-Lite. I posted a guide earlier in this thread and somebody said they might make a sticky out of it but never did \*glances at Xider, then smiles affectionately\* so I'll repost it:
  
  
I edited my Gunnar's schlong size in XPMSSE as follows:
  
1) Open ...\Steam\SteamApps\common\Skyrim Special Edition\data\meshes\actors\character\character assets\skeleton.nif in [NifSkope](https://github.com/jonwd7/nifskope/releases/tag/v2.0.dev6#downloads_2_0_dev6)
  
2) Expand the text window as required to see all the branches
  
3) Expand NiNodes branches 0, 5, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18, 222, 223, 224 and 225
  
4) Edit the Scale value of branches 226 (scrotum) and 232 (schlong) from the default 1.0 (100%) to a larger number- I used 1.2 (120%) for 226 and 1.4 (140%) for 232.
  
5) Save the file
  
6) Repeat the above steps for skeletonbeast.nif (for Argonians and Khajiit) expanding nodes 0, 5, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17, 18, 242, 243, 244, & 245 and editing nodes 246 & 252
  
  
As a rule of thumb, you should enlarge the scrotum by half of the amount you enlarge the schlong- so if you wanted to go to 150% (1.5) on the schlong, you should go to 125% (1.25) on the scrotum. However, that's just a recommendation and you can pretty much do whatever you want.
  
  
By request, I made a [Pictorial Guide to Improving Your Sex Life in Skyrim](https://imgur.com/a/aVXLV) for people who are not comfortable using NifSkope. WARNING: Images in my Schlong-Editing guide contain graphic depictions of naked NiNodes! Not for the faint of heart. ![](https://forums.nexusmods.com/public/style_emoticons/dark/tongue.gif)
  
  
**Female Facial Animation** - This mod really enhances the movement of the female face making it much more expressive than default. Highly recommend installing this to get the most from FG's scenes. Although this is a oldrim package, it works just fine under Skyrim SSE and does not require any conversion. [Download from here](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/35303/?). 
  
  
**FG make-over** - Herowynne has kindly done a make over on all the working ladies in FlowerGirls. Vastly improves the default look. [You can download this from here.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15750)
  
  
Installation:
  
  
1. Simply use your mod manager of choice to install, alternatively for a manual installation copy the contents of the Data directory from the zip file directly to your Skyrim SE or Skyrim VR data directory. Add the FlowerGirls SE.esm to your load order (whilst it should not matter, feel free to run Loot at this point).
  
  
2. Next Run Generate\_FNIS\_For\_Users: Take note that when you run this, if you have installed it correctly as above, then you will see a line in the dialog box mentioning FlowerGirls. (Also note: The version number shown in FNIS is independent from the version number shown on Nexus, I only update that version number when animations are added or changed.)
  
  
3. Please note also that like many mods that add custom dialogue to the game; if your installing FlowerGirls into an existing save game the dialogue options need time to start up. In most cases if you talk to a FlowerGirl NPC or your wife and follower and are NOT seeing any FlowerGirl dialogue entries after install. Create a new save, then restart the game and reload your new save and the dialogue should then appear. If it STILL doesn't appear, don't panic. Create yet another new save, and try moving FlowerGirls.esp higher in your load order, then reload save. The problem will resolve itself eventually regardless once Skyrim catches up. 
  
  
Following installation, you will have five new spells in your repertoire. 'Bewitch!', "Seduce", 'Fornicate', 'Pleasure Self' and 'FG Options':
  
  

  
* **Bewitch!** - Found under Illusion magic. Any adult NPC in the game that is from a playable race, essentially becomes a prostitute for 6 in game hours. Offering their services to you for a small cost in gold.
**Seduce** - Found under Illusion magic. Allows you to seduce the targeted NPC, this has been implemented for those NPC's you are unable to seduce by performing quests/collecting materials for. This obviously requires that you have enabled Seduction in the immersion options for FG. Note that this spell should be extremely rarely needed, it's really for Mod added NPC's.
  
* **Fornicate** - Found under Illusion magic. Animate two targeted NPC's if they are of a permissible type they will get to know each other a great deal better. The scene between them will occur at your exact position.
**Pleasure Self** - Found under Illusion magic. If this one needs explanation then...
  
* **FG Options** - Allows you to customise FG to your desire. Whilst FG has a TINY imprint on your save game, an uninstall option is there also to completely clean your save from any FG influence should you decide this mod is not for you.

  
**PLEASE READ:**
  
  
If after installing FlowerGirls you go into game and find that the animations are not playing, the actors merge together and just make noises without animating. Then it means you have not run GenerateFNISforUsers.exe or the output generated is not being used by Skyrim, in which case check that GenerateFNISforUsers.exe has admin rights and is set up correctly for your choice of mod manager.
  
  
There is NO OTHER cause of this issue. It gets reported on a daily basis, along with private messages daily asking for help. 100% of the time it is because the person reporting it thought that installation instructions did not apply to them so neglected to read it.
  
  
I get many complaints or mails that this mod is broken or has a 'bug' that causes this, consider the possibilities: Either A. This mod has a fundamental flaw and is straight up 'broken'. The thousands of people using it on a daily basis just don't care to mention it.  Or.. B. It is user error. On the balance of probabilities the answer 'B' is usually the correct one.
  
  
Optional Patches:
  
  
**Flower Girls SE - Adventures** - This optional addon works similarly to Amorous Adventures, however with more of a focus on situational sex. At the moment this project is under development so the current scope is limited to a few small quest resolutions. Note that it WILL NOT interfere with the vanilla quests in anyway, it simply is additive. So the vanilla game-play will still be present. This also fits in seamlessly with Amorous Adventures. Current quests/NPC's changed: Thieves Guild - Extort Haelga, Angi's cabin, Heartwood Mill, Bujold (Dragonborn DLC), Eola, Hroki, Lisbet, Lynly, Alva, Annabelle (Knifepoint Mine), Mirri and Tilisu Severin (Dragonborn DLC) and Fjola (Mistwatch).
  
  
**Bathing Beauties or Beefcakes Luxury Suite** - Small patch to add a new line of dialogue to the customers of this wonderful player home. Requires the mod to be installed which you can [download from here](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5646/?). The patch enables Flower Girl features through the dialogue. Include the patch esp AFTER  BBLuxurySuite.esm in your load order.
  
  
**Amorous Adventures** - There is now a fully integrated version of Amorous Adventures here in the files, this will use FlowerGirls directly and no longer requires a separate patch. [It's an incredible piece of work](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7305/?)!
  
  
**Immersive Wenches Patch** - Small patch to provide an additional line of dialogue to all wenches.. there is a rumor that wenches are prepared to go that extra mile! Simply place the patch esp after Immersive Wenches.esp. Obviously requires Immersive Wenches which you can [download from here](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/595/?).
  
  
**FlowerGirls SE - Maids2 Deception**- Patch to allow FlowerGirls to act as the animator for the excellent [Maids2 Deception mod](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/189/?), all brothel scenes are animated retaining the buff/debuff and interactions with Maids are also animated. Install this patch after both SMSkyrim.esm and FlowerGirls SE.esm, enter the game and make a new save. Then exit to main menu, then reload your save.
  
  
**FlowerGirls SE - Cicero Female SE Patch**- Adds custom voice and dialogue for Cicero Female SE. [Requires the main mod](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5212/?). Install the patch after CiceroFemaleSE.esp.
  
  
**FlowerGirls SE - Caesia Patch** - Tiny patch for the wonderful and sexy [Caesia Follower - Borne of Magic](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13389/?). This patch defers her seduction to her own romance quest line and provides animated scenes where appropriate to her romance quest. Install the patch after Caesia in your load order.
  
  
**Sound FX Patch for custom-voiced followers** - This file allows you to add SFX during scenes to your custom voiced followers, or any of the default unique voiced NPC's such as Astrid. Simply rename the path to match the voice-type name of the follower/npc. If you need any guidance on this please post in the forum comments.
  
  
**Wintersun - Faiths of Skyrim Patch** - Simply gives worshippers of Dibella the means to gain favor with her by making love. Occasionally Dibella herself may comment on your activities. (Dibella voiced by the talented Kikiapplus). Install after Wintersun- Faiths of Skyrim.esp. (Requires [Wintersun - Faiths of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22506) by Enai Siaion) 
  
  
Seduction System:
  
  
[font=Arial]Flower Girls includes an optional 'Seduction' system, this is very lightweight and works on a simple basis: Any actor which has or can have a positive relationship with the Dragonborn is able to be seduced. Fullfilling quests, or chopping wood/collecting farm produce/selling ore etc will open the option to start seducing that specific NPC. Followers automatically have a positive disposition to the Dragonborn, so their option is available right away. You can also decide to decline the option permanently for an NPC.
  
  
The idea behind this is like a generic "Amorous Adventures", which obviously covers many more NPC's whilst being far less intricate and entertaining than "AA" itself. Think of it like a generic compromise. If your play-style is more relaxed and you wish to immerse yourself more in sexual activity without an instant "hump everything" button then this feature is aimed at you. Please also note that the Seduction system is fully aware of whether you have AA installed or not, it then blends seamlessly with AA. Securing an AA lover will behind the scenes also fully seduce the NPC.[/font]
  
  
**Raising Seduction:**
  

  
* The easiest way to raise seduction is simply taking them along as your follower. This will rise relatively rapidly and within a few game days the follower will become "Seduced", meaning that they permanently become your lover.
You can also gift items to seduction targets to increase their interest. This has a hidden timer which applies to all seduction targets. Therefore you can only gift several times a day, through-out the day.
  
* Selling wood/farm produce to relevant NPC's will also raise seduction.
Thieves Guild radiant quests will raise seduction on Vex or Devlin.
  
* Witnessing Dragon kills will also raise seduction on seduced targets such as followers or nearby npc's (if they are being seduced).

  
Notes on Followers and Marriage partner:
  
  
Flower Girls will add a dialogue option to any follower, similarly to your marriage partner. This is done completely separately from any follower mod or the default follower dialogue.
  
  
Needless to say, followers and your wife/husband will not charge for their services.
  
  
Notes on Dialogue:
  
  
Please be aware before you download and install this mod, that the dialogue is spliced together from the default voices. This makes of course the choice of words somewhat limiting. Therefore the words used, whilst intended to be over the top and tongue in cheek DO have the capacity to offend. If you are likely to take offence at graphic language then please DO NOT install.
  
  
Notes on Animation:
  
  
The animations are all non-extreme, however they are intended for Adults. There is ungodly amounts of couplings, nudity and outrageous behaviour in these animations. Once again DO NOT install if you find sex scenes offensive.
  
  
Alignments and scaling. The MOD does it's best to try and scale both the players body and the NPC's body to the same size, however this is unreliable and effected by many factors, such as body mods installed (hugely disproportionate bodies will cause clipping too occur). The animations were designed for Male - Female. Female - Female will work however some animations will be misaligned in certain places. In the future, SKSE64 will arrive and it will be possible to be more exacting dynamically, until then.. well just have to ignore these minor issues.
  
  
Positioning. When you initiate a scene, the scene will start at your exact position. To get the best possible results.. don't start scene half-way up stairs or in tight corridors or right next to furniture. Actor separation can occur due to collision with these objects. Try and position yourself in an area with decent amount of free space.
  
  
What can happen, and this is NOT caused by Flower Girls, is immediately after a scene concludes the ending animation gets interrupted by an external script (because Flower Girls has now stopped doing anything to control that actor). This can lead to the actor getting stuck in some weird cycle like trying to play an instrument or something. If that happens (I have seen it twice in hours and hours of testing.. and by almost forcing it to occur) you can reset the NPC by bringing down the console, click the mouse on the NPC and type: playidle IdleSilentBow and the NPC will break out of the stuck cycle.
  
  
**Furniture Awareness**: Flower Girls is aware of nearby furniture, currently double beds, thrones, chairs and workbenches. If you initiate a sex scene near these furniture items; FG will look to see if there is a suitable furniture animation for the position you have chosen and prioritise that. Note that only the default furniture is detected. Furniture from other mods can be fully supported through a small patch or an FG API call.
  
  
**Due to the sheer number of wholly distinct animations in this mod, I have grouped up the animations by type into the categories you are presented with in game. When you initiate a scene you will be getting 1 scene from that category at random. Therefore, scenes run multiple times will in all probability, show you more of the variations available.**
  
  
Notes on Performance:
  
  
Flower Girls is very kind to performance, the animation scene are all event driven which means that Skyrim itself has plenty of room to get on with it's other priorities whilst scenes are playing. Essentially, how it works is you start a scene then the sequence of animations begins to play. The animation controller then tells Skyrim, OK I have started playing this animation, come back to me when I am ready to play the next animation and so on. After each scene is finished, the minimal resources used are flushed in order to not gradually fill up with non-disposed objects. Memory imprint is also very small, the sound files used within scenes are tiny momentary sounds which are re-used for as long as the scene is playing.
  
  
Whilst playing the game and not playing animations, they are no active scripts interfering with the rest of your game. The spell 'Bewitch!' simply places an NPC into a faction and then removes the NPC from the faction when it ends after the duration wears off.
  
  
Therefore running Flower Girls permanently during play-throughs will have negligible impact on both your save game and memory usage. **If you are experiencing slow-downs or performance issues, I can assure you it is not Flower Girls causing it. Turning on Papyrus logging will confirm that.**
  
  
  
Notes on Re-dressing:
  
  
Without SKSE64 it is certainly harder to implement a sophisticated re-dressing system for player characters. At the present time Flower Girls uses a method inspired from the work by Chesko on Campfires. It will work with the default armor/clothing and many custom armor/clothing, but not with all. This is a work in progress so I hope to improve the re-dressing capability in coming patches.
  
  
  
Features to come in subsequent versions:
  
  

  
* Customised greetings/hellos/remarks by Flower Girls to actually show them soliciting.
Several more Flower Girls, probably 1 at each of the smaller settlements.
  
* AI packages and scenes for NPC - NPC interaction.
Further work on audio stage and expressions.
  
* Immersively caught and spread venereal diseases (.. joke.. not happening).

If you wish to do a language translation or overhaul the (less than attractive default) NPC's please be my guest. Just let me know so I can link it from this page.
  
  
Adding Flower Girls Support to your Mod:
  
  
If you have sex scenes within your mod or dialogue that could use Flower Girls features, adding them in is simply only a couple of a lines of code. You set the actor/actors you want to animate into the relevant ReferenceAliases and then place a call depending on what type of animation scene you want. If you are interested in doing this, please drop me a message here and I will provide the instructions on how to achieve it. Because the code is so light, you can even wrap the FG support in a check that the users has FG installed. Therefore you can do it without creating an addon patch separately.
  
  
Finally:
  
  
I sincerely hope you get a few laughs out of this mod, it's a bit of fun and all in all I hope you enjoy using it as much as I have had making it. If you have ideas or suggestions for improvements/changes etc then I am open too all. I may not implement every request but don't take that personally.
