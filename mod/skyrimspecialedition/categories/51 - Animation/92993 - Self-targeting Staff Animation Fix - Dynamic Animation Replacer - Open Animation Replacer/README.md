**Description**
  

  
* The vanilla game only has staves with ***aimed*** enchantments.
However, mods can add ***self-targeting*** staves, which will have broken animations.
  
[list]* ***self-targeting*** staves use the ***self-targeting*** spell animations with the staff model awkwardly attached to the hands.
This leads to things like the staff model clipping through the camera or player model.
  

[\*]This mod replaces the broken 1st and 3rd person animations with ***aimed*** staff animations using either [Open Animation Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92109)﻿ or [Dynamic Animation Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33746)﻿ for the following:
  

  
* ***Self-targeting concentration*** staff animations.
***Self-targeting fire and forget*** staff animations.
  
* ***Ward*** staff animations.
***Telekinesis*** staff animations.
  

[\*]Mod authors can use this to make staves with working animations for:
  

* Telekinesis staff
Heal self staff
  
* Candlelight staff
Clairvoyance staff
  
* Teleport staff
Ward staff
  
* Invisibility staff
Muffle staff
  
* etc...

[\*]The following mods have self-targeting staves:
  

  
* [Carved Brink](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24351) - Staff of Transitions
[Frozen in Time - Definitely Not Another Snow Elf Waifu Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39732) - Staff of Clairvoyance
  

[\*]Currently, the animations are just vanilla animations, but it is easy to make animation replacers work with this: just need to rename some files.
  
[\*]No ESP
  
[\*]I added an optional ESL file with a few staves I used to test out the animations.
  
[/list]**Alternative mod**

  
* [Staves On Self Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89075)﻿
    
  [list]
Does same thing in a different way.* Changes idle conditions via ESP instead of DAR/OAR.
More compatible with animation replacers.* Good mod with SOS name. 10/10 would recommend.

[/list]**Installation/Uninstallation/Update**

  
* Whenever doesn't matter

**Requirements**

  
* ***EITHER*** [Open Animation Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92109)﻿ ***OR*** [Dynamic Animation Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33746).
If you think this mod has 2 requirements, then you're stupid.
