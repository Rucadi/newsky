let me know if I missed or messed up any animation
  
  
  
Future Plans:
  
  
make equip animations for daggers, axes and maces that transition nicely to the mid stance (with a spell in the left hand)
  
  
Known Issues:
  
  
- the upper body does a weird little rotation to the left when casting offensive spells. I'll have to remake the casting animation to fix
