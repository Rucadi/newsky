# Organic Player Animations (OAR)

This mod adds collection of different vanilla style short idle animations to your player character. With a big portion of short idle animations being conditional, in a semi-random way it will form natural idle animation playlist so to speak. I made sure it to have seemless transition matching default pose game has.
  
Utilizing OAR feature "Replace on loop" and thougthfully using new conditions I aimed to make PC seem more aware of what is around. For example: less mannequin-like character in dialogue with addition of subtle animations and more reactive the higher relationship rank with NPC is. Similar progression with rivals. Scratching, stretching, folding arms were added as well, see [full list here](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/99270/99270-1725110651-1750488510.png).
  
For dialogue animations visit [Player Character Gestures (OAR)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106955) - I have Dragonborn Voice Over version and silent protagonist version there

How it looked in 1.0.0 with female skeleton:
  
  
In creation of this mod I used big amount of vanilla idle animations. Majority of them don't have female versions. If "Female" folders in OAR have animation suitable for female skeleton, it will be activated by default. If there were no female version to use, "Female" folder will have animation for male skeleton in it and it will be deactivated by default to ensure most cohesive blend of animations for female PC. But you can enter User mode and activate those animations and see if you would like to have more variety at cost of smooth transition.

Compatibility
  
Priority numbers of submods of this mod are intentionally made to be very low (-100000000 to -99999969). DAR folder number conflict is the only type of conflict my mods can have. It is not gamebreaking, basically installing other player idle dynamic animation replacer mod you will completely overwrite blend of animations this mod provides. You can have my mod for male characters and install another one like [Female Player Animations (DAR)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85073) over it for female characters or vice versa.
  
Compatible with [Stand still in RaceMenu (OAR)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/96970), [EVG Conditional Idles](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34006) and everything else because folder priority is so low.
