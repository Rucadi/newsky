[font=Verdana]❖ Introduction ❖
  
[/font]
  
[font=Verdana]I always play as a spellsword, so i wanted to do magic justice. 
  
  
Unique animations per each magic school, with different flavour and style. Fireball is not the same as healing touch.
  
  
Compatible with all other animation replacers. Yes, you can install it on top of CPFAO. No, it won't break anything. [/font]﻿

❖ [font=Verdana]FAQ[/font] ❖
  
[font=Verdana]
  
[/font][font=Verdana]Q: Is it compatible with X?
  
A: Should be compatible with everything, but if not - tell me about it
  
  
Q: You said that you changed every animation, but you actually forgot X!
  
A: If it's not movement, or spell-switch animations - then yeah, i forgot, tell me about it! 
  
  
Q: Camera movement makes me motion-sick
  
A: Sad to hear this, but i won't do anything about this, because it will require A LOT of VERY boring work from me.
  
  
Q: I don't like something!
  
A: Sad to hear this, but i also won't do anything about this (if it's not a bug). Blender is free, you can make anims yourself.
