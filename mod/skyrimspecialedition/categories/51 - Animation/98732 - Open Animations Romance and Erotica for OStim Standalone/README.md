**How to use**

*This is the OARE logo in OStim navigation*

  

  
* It is accessed through **any OStim starting idle animation for two characters**. Therefore, you must start an OStim scene between two characters.
I recommend that you install a gameplay mod that allows immersive scene starting, such as [OStim Romance](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/107671) for vanilla NPCs and [Love Story Romance Subjects](https://discord.gg/ostim)﻿ for new voiced NPCs;
  
* Many animations are made with support for first person view. To see them in first person, get [Improved Camera](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93962) and the OARE configuration from this mod page. *Notice: the OARE file is **different** from the OStim configuration file. I made both files, but the latter is outdated and I cannot update it.*
On the OStim MCM, if you set OStim up so that it only shows animations for the intended sexes, that is supported by OARE and you'll only see animations suited for your character's anatomy.
