# Keyword Compatibility Framework
- Author: V3kta
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

KCF was created as a keyword resource for modders and a simple way for users to make MCO/DAR animations compatible with non-vanilla weapon types.
  
  
What does this mean?
  
  
With this mod installed, non-vanilla weapons (e.g. Spears) will **all** be able to use the animations you installed for that type of weapon. If you for example have Heavy Armory, Skyrim Spear Mechanic and Animated Armoury installed, all Spears included in that mod will be able to use the correct spear animations of supported mods.

* My plans to update everything to OAR standard are sadly not feasible as 
    
  long as animation authors don't update their mods to the coming OAR
    
  structure. I will still support the old DAR structure for now til these
    
  mods (hopefully) update.
