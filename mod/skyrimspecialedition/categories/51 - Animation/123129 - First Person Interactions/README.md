**[font=Georgia]MOD PREVIEW[/font]**

  
**[font=Georgia]Q&A[/font]**

**Q: ESL flagged?**
  
*A: Yes.*
  
  
**Q: Dynamic Animation Replacer?**
  
*A: I'm sorry, it won't work with DAR.*
  
  
**Q: Looting/Pickpocketing animations don't play nicely with paused menus?**
  
*A: Enable or disable Unpaused menus support in the MCM.*
  
  
**Q: Some animations look weird, hands float, camera doesn't move, I'm too far away, etc...?**
  
*A: Camera won't move automatically during the animations, in fact I hate that, also, the hands will follow the camera during the animations, so just position yourself properly, move closer, sneak when looting, etc...
  
I did my best, though. The mod is also open to contributions, so if you want to make some alternative animations and release them as a separated mod, go ahead, I'll highly appreciate it :D.*
  
  
**Q: I don't like x feature?**
  
*A: Use the MCM or OAR to customize the mod.*
  
  
**Q: Improved Camera?**
  
*A: Currently not 100% compatible, as Improved Camera will force the third person animations when the weapons are not drawn..*
