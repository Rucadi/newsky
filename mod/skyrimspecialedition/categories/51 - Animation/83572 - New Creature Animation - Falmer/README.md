# New Creature Animation - Falmer

The combat with Falmer lacks depth. Previously, when I observed my follower attacking falmers, they couldn't even retaliate under constant assault by my follower, making the exploration of falmer caves lack immersion. So in this update, I added some animations to allow the falmer to change their attack patterns, making it look like they are thinking and attempting to blend into the darkness to ambush the player. They are somewhat like creepy ninjas. Will add some randomness to combat.
  
  
  
  
  
This update needs Behavior Injector and Payload Interpreter.
