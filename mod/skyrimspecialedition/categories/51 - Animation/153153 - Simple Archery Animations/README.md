**[font=Georgia]INTRODUCTION[/font]**

  
This mod will add some new archery animations to the game, inspired by Archery Gameplay Overhaul. I always liked how the player held the bow, but the nocked arrow part of the animations always made them difficult to combine with other archery animation mods, so I decided to make some simple animations for it.
  
  
Includes sneaking, first and third person animations.
  
Optional files include animations for belt-fastened quivers (you also need Immersive Equipment Displays (IED) and Open Animation Replacer - IED Conditions. To change the quiver position, open the menu for IED and use the bar at the top and go to View>Gear nodes menu, select your character/player and change Quiver node to Quiver Chesko on the Placement section).

There's also an optional file for skill based animations (animations will only play after reaching lvl 50 in archery or being a bosmer. Or they'll only play before lvl 50, if you want to combine with other archery mods).
