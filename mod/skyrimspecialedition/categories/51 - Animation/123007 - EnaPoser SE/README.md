Some of the Object Poses are not consistent with high heels due to the intent to ground the Object.
  
Combat Pose does not include weapons or shields. If necessary, hold the weapon or shield in the ready position before playing the pose.

NiOverride Pose Adjustments + Objects SE (find at Lovers Lab or Daymarr Workshop)
  
Delicate hand poses may cause positional inconsistencies.
  
This is due to Skyrim's highly flexible character-making process, which allows for the flexible scaling of each body part.
  
In other words, my Dovahkiin and your Dovahkiin have different body sizes.
  
By using this mod, fine adjustments can be made.
  
ScreenArcherMenu offers more advanced features, so adjustments can also be made using this tool.
