**Q&A**

  
* **Q. If player is on the front-right or front-left side of the horse, how does your animation work?**
A. I've added angle conditions in a script and animations for front right/left. It's not perfect but better than nothing.
  

  
* **Q. Your animation has conflicts with a mod uses same priority.**
A. Open OAR UI, find Dynamic Horse Petting - horse and rider, edit priority in user mode.
  

  
* **Q. It's not working. All i can see is the original animation.**
A. You need to be pretty close to your horse to see it. You can edit the script & OAR config to change the distance float.
  

  
* **Q. Pet activate button doesn't show up.**
A. If you use Dynamic Action Key - MCM, reassign the key.
  

  
* **Q. Horses keep teleporting to me when i tried to hug them!**
A. If you use I'm Glad You're Here, turn off horse interaction in IGYH MCM.
  

  
* **Q. Why OAR only?**
A. DAR has no condition for headtracking target distance.
  

  

  
* **Q. Why have you modified the script?**
A. To get global value, distance and angle more accurately.
  

  

  
* **Q. Would these animations look weird with a mod replaces horse model?**
A. Not sure. You might want to try it by yourself.
  

  

  
* **Q. Does this work on an existing save?**
A. Yes. I've tested in my game.
  

  

  
* **Q. LE ver?**
A. Unlikely to happen. There are neither up-to-date OAR nor Immersive Interactions on LE.
  

  

  
* **Q. How to disable the animation in game?**
A. Go to OAR UI, find Dynamic Horse Petting - horse and rider, uncheck the box in user mode.
  

  

  
* **Q. There's a room for improvement in the mod.**
A. Leave a comment or submit a bug report, i'll look into it.
