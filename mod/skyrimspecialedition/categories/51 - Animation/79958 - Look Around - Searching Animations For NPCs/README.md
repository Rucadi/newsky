**Q&A**
  
> * Q. It's not working.
> A1. You didn't install the requirement - Install it (also its requirements), restart a game.
>   
> * A2. NPCs are not in alert mode. You won't see any animations if you are already in combat.
> In combat = NPCs have found you and charged toward you.
>   
>
>   
>
>   
> * Q. Why DAR?
> A. Idk how to make this work with FNIS/Nemesis.
>   
>
>   
>
>   
> * Q. Is it okay to install the mod mid-playthrough?
> A. Yes.
>

>   
>
>   
> * Q. [color=#ffffff]Is the mod compatible with X Mod?[/color]
> [color=#ffffff]A. Probably. But i'm not sure. You might wanna try it by yourself.[/color]

>   
> * Q. I don't see any difference.
> A. Ok.
>   
>
>   
>
>   
> * Q. Can you make an animation like this for creatures (draugr, beasts...)
> A. I can't. There are no available rigs for them.
>   
>
>   
>
>   
> * Q. Is this script-heavy?
> A. No. Just one simple script to get combat state and activate animations. It's necessary because DAR has no combatstate condition.
>   
> * I know there's IsInCombat() but it has no use for this mod.
>
>   
>
>   
> * Q. Why esp?
> A. Without a plugin, the script won't work. If you want to remove the mod mid-playthrough, just delete **Look Around\_DISTR.ini.**
>   
> * And delete the rest of the files before you start a new playthrough.
>
>   
>
>   
> * Q. I don't like certain animation.
> A. Get [DAR Explorer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73930?tab=files)﻿ to find the animation you don't like and delete that hkx file. Or you can make a new animation or something.
