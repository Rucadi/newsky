Replace Ordinator's Perform, Irresistible Dance, and Earthquake Drum animations with custom ones.
  
Requires Ordinator and FNIS/Nemesis (you have to run the tool both after installing or removing this, of course).
  
Mod managers are not necessary, but MO2 is extremely recommended.
  
The .esp provided by this mod must be below Ordinator's for it to work.
  
Perform is a pole dance, Irresistible Dance is a regular dance, and Earthquake Drum is a slightly more feminine drumming animation.
  
  
If you want to mod this: you can replace any animation and related objects. Note that ordObj2 is a placeholder.
  
  
I'm also looking for something for the drum animation, so feel free to suggest things.
