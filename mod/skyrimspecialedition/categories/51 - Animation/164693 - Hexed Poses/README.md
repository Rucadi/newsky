**81 poses (including 6 object poses) for your screenshotting needs.**

  
**How to use:**
  
  
1. Install like any other mod.
  
2. Run Pandora/FNIS/Nemesis depending on which one you use (Pandora *highly recommended*).
  
3.a. If you use **ScreenArcherMenu** (*highly recommended*), you can select poses in the 'Play Idle' menu.
  
3.b. If you use **Poser Hotkeys Plus**, you can use the supplied patch, or run the [size=3]PoserDataGen  utility yourself (available [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/72623?tab=files&file_id=1000203220) if you don't have it) to allow PHP to recognize the new poses; if you see 'HexPose' in the list, you'll know you've installed it correctly.
  
3.c. If you use **Photo Mode**, you're on your own because I don't know how it works. I'm guessing it's like SAM meaning it'll automatically detect the poses.
  
  
**FAQ**:
  
  
Q: *My character just stands there / T-poses when I select a pose*
  
A: You didn't run Pandora/FNIS/Nemesis. 
  
  
Q: *My character's knees are scrunched up in certain poses / my character's hands are hovering or clipping / something looks weird*
  
A: These poses are generally designed with the assumption that users know how to use ScreenArcherMenu or NIOPA to make adjustments, because it isn't possible to make a pose that will look perfect with all body shapes. Simply adjust the pose using your tool of choice. For scrunched knees, this is a known issue in all CBBE-based bodies and can be fixed by adjusting the position of the calf bone.
  
  
Q: *I need to adjust the position of an AnimObject. Which node should I edit?*
  
A: The node you'll want to select is "Anim Object L".
  
  
Q: *Where do I download ScreenArcherMenu?*
  
A: ScreenArcherMenu for Skyrim doesn't have a public release on Nexus yet, but you can get it from the creator's Discord channel. An invite is [at their profile](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/maximusmaxy?gameId=1151).
