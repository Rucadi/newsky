**Unique Animations Reworked
  
[size=4]by raiserfx**[/size]**Description:**

This mod replaces two unique animations: Bathing hunter near Darkwater Crossing (idlelaydown.hkx) and Astrid Dark Brotherhood introduction scene (mt\_idlelounge.hkx).

  

The goal was to fix the ugly bending of the arms and provide an alternative pose, which still is close to the vanilla animation.
  
  
All animations have been created from scratch.
