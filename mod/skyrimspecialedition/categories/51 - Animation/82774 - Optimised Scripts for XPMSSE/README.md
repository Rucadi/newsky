*[color=#00ffff]Optimised two scripts from the XP32 Maximum Skeleton Special Extended - XPMSSE mod. Requires the original mod. Does not change any functionality except for improving efficiency.*[/color]

  
  
[/color]Requirements

Installation
  
- Same as any other standard mod, recommend installing using a Mod Manager.
  
- Note that this is not a full mod, just a patch.
  
- Clean saving should not be required, though to be 100% safe, try to create the saved game for which you first install this file in a quiet place (minimising the chances of any major scripted events being currently active).  
  
  
  
(In)compatibilities
  
There are many other mods out there also including various XPMSSE scripts, with various fixes in them. I built on these files, and you should install these before mine, letting mine overwrite at the end. [color=#ffff00]**Please make sure that you have these mods installed, in exactly this order** (such that later ones always overwrite earlier ones):
  
  
1) Firstly, install XPMSSE itself: <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1988>
  
2) Secondly, install XPMSSE - Fixed Scripts: <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44252>
  
3) Thirdly, install XPMSSE - Nemesis - Papyrus Stack Fix: <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60363> (**version 4.8.3 OR version 4.8.4**)
  
4) Finally, install my mod.[/color]
  
  
[color=#00ffff]See Also
  
[/color][color=#ffffff][size=3]- If you do not care about the styles functionality of XPMSSE at all, rather than installing my mod and all its requirements, it may be better to use [XP32 Maximum Skeleton Lite](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69583).[/size][/color]
