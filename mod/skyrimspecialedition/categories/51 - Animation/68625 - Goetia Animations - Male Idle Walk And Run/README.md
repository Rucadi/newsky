# Goetia Animations - Male Idle Walk And Run
- Author: Verolevi
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68625
This mod contains the following male animations:
  

  
* 30 seconds long idle that cycles between different poses.
Two-cycle forward and side directions for walk.
  
* Two-cycle forward and side directions for run.

  
Can be installed either as a simple replacer or as a "Conditional Armor Type Animations" addon which can be used alongside other CATA addons to change the actors' animations depending on their armor type and, in the case of Goetia, their mage criteria:
  
  
If using the CATA Addon version of this mod, the characters (PC and NPCs) will use these animations when non-armored, wearing clothing equipment, has a magicka pool of at least 300 (items/buffs apply) or is at least level 65 in any of the 5 major magic schools (can be changed from "\_conditions.txt").
