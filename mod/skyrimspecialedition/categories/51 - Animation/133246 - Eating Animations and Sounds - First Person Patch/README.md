**[font=Georgia]IMPORTANT[/font]**

  
- Probably not necessary if using Improved Camera (it's still not fully compatible).
  
- To customize the mod, find **Eating Animations and Sounds - 1st** in the Open Animation Replacer menu and disable the animations you don't like.
  
- Should work will all patches made for Eating Animations and Sounds.
  
- Some misalignments are expected during the animations.
  
- Sitting animations are not supported at the moment, animations won't play (unless you use the tableware, then third person is forced).
  
- The optional file with the "CleanUp" workaround will replace mods that overwrite vanilla animations directly, such as Pristine Vanilla Movement and Assorted Animation Fixes. If you are not experiencing the "food stuck" on hand issue, then you don't need to install it.
