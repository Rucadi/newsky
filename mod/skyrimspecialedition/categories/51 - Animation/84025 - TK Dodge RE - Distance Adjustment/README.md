**Description**
  
You might have noticed that the TK dodge distance in different directions are not the same. Basically, they are about:
  
  
***Forward ~ 410
  
Backward ~ 300
  
Side(left & right)  ~ 250***
  
This is quite noticable when you have [TDM](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51614) installed, your character will perform forward dodge animation (410 <----> 250) when dodge aside with no target locked and this make it annoying more or less. To make it consistant, I made this Nemesis Patch. All dodge distance are the same now: 
  
  
***Forward ~ 300 ~~410~~
  
Backward ~ 300
  
Side(left & right)  ~ 300 ~~250~~***
  
  
Briefly, your forward dodge will be **25%** shorter, side dodge will be **20%** longer. Now your character will dodge by the same distance no matter whether combat target are locked or not.
  
  
**Installation**
  
1 You need Nemesis and TK Dodge firstly. Ofcourse the [TK Dodge RE - Script Free](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56956) is the recommandation.
  
2 Install this patch **AFTER** the the TK dodge and Nemesis files, or just overwrite all the same files.
  
3 Refresh the Nemesis.
  
  
**Compatibility**This is just a Nemesis patch, so it is compatible with almost **Every Animation Mod**. Animations have nothing to do with movement distance actually.
