Additions compare to original BFCO:
  
- Block button
  
- Bash power with combo key
  
- PA key function with Directional PA
  
- Combine inputs
  
  
Basically moved the logic of BFCO from papyrus to SKSE, I didn't touch any first person logic all the changes was for third person, but I fixed the BFCO power attack in first person, so its like MCO, if you are using with [CMF](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/157948), CMF will handle directional power attack so if you let it enable and a moveset doesnt have directional power attack it will play the normal power attack, the same is for combo attack﻿.
  
The MCM has removed and changed to use SKSE Menu Framework, you can open the menu in F1
