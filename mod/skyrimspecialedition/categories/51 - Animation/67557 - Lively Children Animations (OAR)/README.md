# Lively Children Animations (OAR)
- Author: CHIMgarden
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

This mod adds more interesting idles, neutral and angry dialogue gestures and other animation variants specifically to children. Also some animations added to Narfi and Cicero, but not Babette or Skuli. To the extent it was possible by reusing vanilla assets, I tried to make them appear more curious and playful - like kids supposed to be.
  
  
Some animations were already added to children with my other mods [NPC Animation Remix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63471), [Gesture Animation Remix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64420) and [Immersive folded hands](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62849), so I made this mod with consideration of it. It`s like three layer cake and this mod adds frosting on top of it. Also I chose folder numbers in such a way what conditional idles from other mods will work for children. 
  
  
You don`t have to install this 3 mods if you don`t want, this mod can work standalone, but without it you will see about 90% of full picture I tried to paint. 90% is a lot though and way better than vanilla state.

This mod made with reused and previously unused vanilla animations extracted from Animations.bsa and modified with [hkxPoser](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11783) by [opparco](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/47355643), when it was needed. Another mod I couldn`t make it without - [More Informative Console](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19250) by [Linthar](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/1603187) - I used it to reveal information about NPCs, objects and locations to apply as part of conditions in DAR
  
And of course, existence of all my mods depends on genius [Open Animation Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92109) by [Ershin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/2749008)
