[font=Tahoma]I[/font][font=Tahoma] remade a mod.

[font=Tahoma]I’ve made similar mods before, but they had quite a few issues related to my inexperience, incorrect exports, rigging problems, and my overall approach.
  
  
This time I redid everything from scratch and added swimming, jumping, and falling animations. The headbob is smoother now. There are no issues with crossbow reloading or bow drawing while sneaking. The animations should look good with any reasonable FOV.
  
  
[/font][font=Tahoma]Vanilla Skyrim’s behavior for fall animations works very strangely — movement-related fall animations don’t start from frame zero, but somewhere around the first third to half of the animation. I tested this quite thoroughly and adjusted the animations accordingly, but if you run into any issues, please let me know and show how it looks
