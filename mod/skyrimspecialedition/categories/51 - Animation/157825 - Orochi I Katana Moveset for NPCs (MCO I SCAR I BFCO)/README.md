With **Smooth's permission**, I adapted and patched his Orochi moveset to **SCAR**.
  
  
As usual, the moveset was **EXTREMELY** simplified for NPC use.
  
  
There are no restrictions on which NPCs can use the moveset, but you can limit them by
  
downloading the **optional condition file** or *tweaking the conditions yourself* in OAR.
  
  
A **BFCO conversion** was made, which can also be used by the player, but don’t be mistaken— it follows the same
  
simplifications made for the NPC version. So don’t expect Original For Honor
  
features like directional attacks, follow-ups, and parries.
