# Snuggly Vanilla Laydown Idles - (DAR - OAR Variance)
- Author: Mxnedula
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49717


This is particularly made for use with Campfire and Go To Bed, as Campfire uses the vanilla animation for the player bedroll while NPC's use Go To Bed (or a side sleeping animation). Basically, if you'd prefer to be spooned by your snuggler, hug them, etc. instead of laying there staring into the abyss as they snooze, this is for you.
  
  
LE version now available:[font=Georgia] ([/font][font=Arial][https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/107843/](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/107843/)[/font][font=Georgia])[/font]
  
  
[font=Georgia]**Notes:**[/font]
  
[font=Arial]• Because the animations are made to be paired, if you're laying on your own sometimes it will look... lonely. There's no way to fix this other than using animations that look nice both ways, which I probably won't add because it defeats the purpose of this mod-- **snuggling**. If you're worried about this though, the Replacer Only version is a good alternative if you prefer the idle.
  
[/font]• Male Player Version is different in the way that it also replaces Go To Bed / the "Bedroll\_sleep\_01-02" animations so that the NPC is to the right of the player, putting the player in the more dominant position. Male Player Version also has new animations to suit the updated NPC positioning. Both versions look mostly fine for either gender of player, but I *highly* recommend this if you play a male character and you snuggle with a female NPC. Any potentially "lonely" variants are applied to the player, to save your cherished lover's arms and knees (there are legitimate reasons but I'm leaving it at that). The only negative thing about this repositioning is that the enter/exit animation has clipping.
  
• There shouldn't be any bugs, if you encounter a bug it is likely caused by an unrelated bed/lay-down alteration you may be using. (Such as you can run into problems if your Campfire tent, rough-bedding, etc. is placed oddly and your character is unable to lay down.) 
  
• Fully compatible with Sleep Tight, Simple Actions, Etc. If you encounter a conflict, just overwrite it with this mod (especially Go To Bed). 
  
• Clipping can happen, it's normal as every character/npc setup is different.
  
• Animations on FULL Version should be suitable for both genders, but will look best with female player, male NPC.
  
• Bed Add-On provides more snuggly variance to Go To Bed - DAR Patch animations. Its assets do not include any bedroll animations, so you can use one of the Laydown versions with it. Made to be used with Go To Bed and Go To Bed DAR patch. **This file is BETA, it is stable and won't cause any problems but may not be perfect, the worst thing that can happen is clipping.**
  
•If you want to adjust the chance of getting a variant, simply open /DynamicAnimationReplacer/\_CustomConditions/ and subfolder(s), -500, -501, (and -502, in Variance Only), change the percentage to the desired amount in "\_conditions.txt", and save. You can do this for each individual variant if you have a preference in animation or just want to.
  
  
  
**[font=Georgia]Notes on Installing/Version Specific Requirements:[/font]**
  
• FULL Version can technically be used completely out of the box, however, it requires Campfire or another mod that changes/adds bedroll functionality for two people to actually be useful. ~~Go To Bed is HIGHLY recommended and the only way to get the same results as seen in the screenshots.~~• Update: Go To bed is **required**, go getchu some.
  
• Male Player Only Version **requires properly installed Go To Bed with animations "Bedroll\_sleep\_01," and "Bedroll\_sleep\_02."**
  
• Bed Add-On is standalone from this mod's main files, but **requires functional Go To Bed and Go To Bed - DAR Patch.**
  
• You only need to generate Nemesis **if you're new to Go To Bed**, otherwise, all versions are good to go out of the box provided you have their requirements.
  
  
[font=Georgia]**Updates/support?**
  
[/font]• This mod is a little unimportant in the scope of things (granted we all need snuggling, come on) so I won't be checking in on it often. If something's really bugging you though feel free to DM me and I'll try to help.
