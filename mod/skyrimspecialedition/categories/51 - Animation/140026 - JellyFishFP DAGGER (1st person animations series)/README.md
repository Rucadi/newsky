Okay, jokes aside, I made overhaul almost all of the first person dagger animations so that they look fresh and at the
  
same time combine with each other and offer the smoothest experience possible (possible for me xdd).
  
This took about two months of work including a long playtest through all Enderal lol
  
  
This is a project with almost 200 animation files [size=2](I’ll keep silent about the fact that some of this is a partial reuse or duplicates, I have to sell myself somehow), which I initially didn’t expect and a lot of completely unexpected work came out.
  
  
  
[font=Courier New]                        FAQ[/font]
  
  
Okay, let's talk about some things and questions about that you may have.
  
  
\*You messed up left hand [font=Tahoma][size=4][size=3]weapon[/size][/font] position!
  
Not me. Bethesda.
  
The weapon node in the left hand is not affected by animation. Why? I have no idea. To fix we have Dual Wield Unlocker. But it only works for third person. Uvii i guess.
  
  
\*Hands too close to my face!
  
Animations are designed for high FOV (90-115)
  
This is partly my mistake, but adapting it to a smaller FOV will be VERY hard and time consuming. Sorry, it's my mistake because... I originally made it for myself......
  
You can adjust FOV for hands only. Use Improved Camera
  
  
\*Equip animations with two daggers do not work!
  
Priority conflict with Weapon Styles animations.
  
Lower their priority in the OAR menu (shift+O)
  
  
\*I[font=Tahoma][size=3]nspection[/size][/font] animations and “why, instead of a block, I have strange arm swirls or wtf is this idk.”
  
Well....that's how it works, outside of combat, holding a block activates the inspection animation.
  
  
\*The animations with magic are weird. 
  
Maybe. I know. But I had no choice because... The first person behavior is broken (surprise surprise, in Skyrim again something doesn’t work as it should)
  
When you cast a spell, the casting animation does not affect the second hand, so I had to make a separate set of animations for magic + dagger.
  
But this is not something surprising, it is quite right (for vanilla), although it puts a spoke in the wheels of me as an animator.
  
But what you say about the fact that when sprinting with magic in your left hand, the sprint animation for your right hand does not work, and running animation plays instead? So...well, I did what I could to find a compromise between maintaining my vision and trying to hide these problems.
  
  
\*Dualwield attaks. Is it balanced?

Well....[/left][/size][/font]

[font=Tahoma]But yes. Partially.
  
[/font][font=Tahoma]
  
Attacks have the same animation length as vanilla, but have two hitframes.
  
If you use precision (and I assume you do), then the physical damage of each weapon will be reduced by half. So on average the DPS will be almost the same as if you pressed rmb-lmb-rmb with vanilla animations.[/font][font=Tahoma]But this doesn't apply to enchantments and I can't do anything about it. Enchanted weapons will do double magic dps/drain/etc, so don't enchant one of the daggers, I don't know, or don't use my mod, you know, fuck me, right?![/font][font=Tahoma]Another modmaker cannot do anything properly, and wrote big description, [/font][font=Tahoma]as if someone will read it[/font][font=Tahoma].
  
[/font][font=Tahoma]Okay, back to the topic.[/font][font=Tahoma]If you are NOT using precision, then I write for this correct [font=Tahoma][size=3]vanilla behavior[/font] annotations, so you will also have two visually correct hitframes. But. Both strikes will be considered a right hand attack, so keep that in mind. Damage will be counted only from the right hand, the enchantment will only work from the right hand, and only the right weapon will be discharged.[/size][/font][font=Tahoma]
  
  
\*Precision collisions break randomly
  
Yes. This is a precision issue, unfortunately. I can’t do anything about it, I can’t even say under what circumstances it happens. Perhaps you don't have such a problem at all. Anyway, IT'S NOT MY FAULT
  
  
That's all. Thanks for reading
  
  
I have more first person mods that might interest you. For third person too
