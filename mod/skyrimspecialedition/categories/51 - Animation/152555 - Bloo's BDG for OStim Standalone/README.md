Overview
  
  
**Bloo's BDG** is an animation pack for OStim Standalone focused on **futa (top)** / **female (bottom)** pairings with a size difference— **1.1x** for the former and **0.95x** for the latter. This pack aims to balance quality animations with a variety of different positions, which include small modifiers to throw in along the way to keep things fresh between scenes.
  
  
After using OStim for some time, I found it frustrating that this particular pairing, even without a size difference, required tweaking alignments on practically every male/female animation to get it looking normal. Thus, I learned how to animate and made this pack, and all animations were made with female body/penis positions in mind! Everything should be appropriately aligned out of the box. No more tweaking schlong .nif files to awkwardly stretch them to the male position— These are for the girls!

Installation & Usage
  
  
**Requirements**
  

  
* [OStim Standalone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98163)﻿
[Pandora](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/133232) or [Nemesis](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60033)﻿
  

  
Additionally, you need a dick. I use [The New Gentleman](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/104215) with TRX Futanari Addon NG (can found via [this post on Trixter's Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/posts/new-home-for-133095235)). Sizes small to medium work best.
  
  
Install as you would any other OStim animation pack. Run Pandora/Nemesis before using. See OStim Standalone mod page for detailed instructions.
  
  
Look for the BDG icon towards the top of the OStim navigation menu in most M/F and F/F idles (standing, laying, sitting, etc.).
  
  
**Important:** The Futa actor is always the 'Dom' in my scenes, and the Female actor is always the 'Sub'. If you don't see the BDG icon appear anywhere, go to your OStim Standalone MCM settings, and under the Gender Roles sub-menu, make sure you are not forcing your character into the wrong role.

I'd also recommend trying out [OCum Ascended](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77506). It's not required, but it will result in cum decals being applied whenever a top orgasms externally, and adds to the overall artistic vision!

FAQs
  
  
**Can I use these animations for male/female pairings? What about femboys? What about ...?
  
  
You can do whatever you want, but your mileage may vary**. These animations are specifically made for large-female-body-with-dick topping a female-body-with-vagina. Any other body/genital pairing is not officially supported. You can attempt to use these animations with other gender pairings, but alignment is not guaranteed. I've had users report that these animations are somewhat aligned with an M/F pairing, but require small tweaks. I will not be modifying my animations to support this right now. This pack might officially support more gender pairings in the future, but the whole vision of this was to revolve around tall girls that pack. Anything outside of that is a bonus.
  
  
**I don't see the BDG icon anywhere in my navigation menu!**
  
  
As mentioned in the Installation & Usage section: The Futa actor is always the 'Dom' in my scenes, and the Female actor is always the 'Sub'. If you don't see the BDG icon appear anywhere, go to your OStim Standalone MCM settings, and under the Gender Roles sub-menu, make sure you are not forcing your character into the wrong role.
  
  
**I'm using these animations with the correct pairing but it's still misaligned!**Go through the following troubleshooting steps:
  
  

  
* **Have you scaled your character's height in RaceMenu?** OStim takes care of scaling the characters for you. If you have altered the height/scale of your character in RaceMenu, the OStim scalings will be stacked on top of that and cause misalignment. I will look into creating a FOMOD with an option for unscaled animations for those who prefer to keep their girls Big 'n Tall at all times.
**Are you using a BodySlide preset that drastically shifts the position of the groin?** When creating BodySlide presets, compare the position of the genitals with the `-Zeroed Sliders-` base body to ensure it isn't changing! The 'Move Crotch' (under 'Butt') and 'Forward' (under 'Hips') are usually the sliders to blame for penetration misalignment, so check to see that they are not affecting your groin position. (This is not specific to my animations, but just a good general rule of thumb I've encountered.)
  
* **Are you using [Mu Joint Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61479)﻿?** Please make sure you have the **SL-OStim Patch** under **Optional Files**. In my own testing and from volunteer reports, Mu Joint Fix can cause some alignment issues as it changes the way legs bend and where the groin/thighs/feet end up. This patch seems to help with this, but keep in mind it may not completely eliminate the problem.
**Are you using [SMP Collision for TRX's Male and Futanari Schlongs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/116144)﻿?** Please make sure you are using the **Female Alignment (FA)** option in your BodySlide builds. As mentioned in the Overview, these animations are aligned with normal female penis position in mind, and not the patched male override position.
  
* **Have you manually altered your female penis .nif file?** If you've overridden the female penis HKX configuration to `**SOSmale.hkx**`, or installed a mod that does it for you, you **must reset this** back to **female** or the animations will not be aligned for the same reason mentioned above.

Thanks & Credits
  
  
Thank you so much to everyone who test my animations pre-release and gave invaluable feedback for me to iterate with! Thanks also to the great animators in the OStim Community Discord ([Ace](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/aceanimations) and [Moon](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/CallMeMoon) to name two) who helped me get started with animating and answered all my questions along the way!
