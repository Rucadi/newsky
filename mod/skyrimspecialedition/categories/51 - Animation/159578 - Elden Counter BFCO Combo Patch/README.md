I added annotations so that you can attack immediately after counterattack, instead of letting [Elden Counter](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65579)'s animation play in its entirety and suffer enemy attacks for nothing.
  
  
The animation used in the picture is from [MCO I BFCO ER LightGreatswords Complete (1hm 2hm dw)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/122878)
