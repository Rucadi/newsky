**A few words for version 2.0 :**
  
Spoiler
  
Hello everybody. It’s been more than two years since the first release of Underdog. This one supersedes the old one in every way.
  
**Consider this one a working beta version for now and expect frequent updates**. I did my best at polishing v2.0, but I can’t play test the entire game, so expect some things to be off until I sort things out.
  
Please, if it's not a big trouble for you, I’d love to read your comments about things you liked, disliked, experienced, requests. That will help me out to enrich the conditions. Again, I am a one person team here and I can’t possibly account for all the different load orders. Leave comments or bug reports with NPC's you think are canditates for sad, happy, sexy, strut etc. People that should be greeting you but aren't, or maybe they are greeting you too much etc. Animations that look bugged, twitchy whatever. Skyrim's animation field is a finicky place to venture for an animator. Be specific please.
  
  
Almost every animation has been remade and re-evaluated. The old ones got considerable changes, so don’t be quick to dismiss them. For example the sneak movement module got a lot simpler on how it works and doesn’t require the scrolling speed mod to look good. It’s better if you have it, but not necessary anymore.
  
I mostly focused on the new ones and a lot of them have extensive conditions. Please use OAR’s ingame preview ability to pinpoint which animation played or [Show Animation Command](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74034) or [Show Animation Command NG - SKSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/104356) to see which animation played in the console. 
  
Some fit perfectly lore wise, some are humorous and others just for laughs. I hope you enjoy them all in your game as much as I enjoyed making them and sharing them with you. Don’t forget to endorse if you liked Underdog.
  
  
And remember, Underdog, in its core, is not meant to replace, but rather add to your active animation packs.

Soooo I recently responded to an invitation that I saw at Distar's mod pages, and then I got into a Discord server, and then the people there were kind enough to share their knowledge and guidance to get into animating and one thing lead to another and, well, here we are.
  
  
This was a massive undertaking and took many, many, oh so many painful hours to make, mostly because Skyrim being Skyrim, but there it is. I consider this to be my contribution to the Skyrim animation scene and while this is not original work made from scratch, I was the first one to implement this into the game and broaden the horizons of what is availiable to us, to make the game we love, a better experience.
  
  
  
*I present to you the Underdog - animations.*
  
I chose to go with this name because the animations I chose to include are for the most part non existant or with very few options. DAR always intrigued me with all those special functions and what it could be achieved. Back then I couldn't do anything about it, but now you can have an immersive playthrough like none other before. Mods like [Immersive interactions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47670), [EVG conditional idles](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34006)﻿ and so many other great animation mods brought much needed varierty to the game, and I thought I could expand on that ideas.

Spoiler
  
and in the end you ll have to choose between one or the other animation pack. My goal is different. I focused on the little things. The things that surround the player moving around the world and the gameplay aspect from an animator's point of view. (I could never do what JaySerpa does :).)
  
If you wanna play sneak characters for example, the same old vanilla animation is ok I guess, but what if I were to tell you that you can have different walking animations depending on how fast your moving, what are you current weapons equipped, how much injured you are? I can relate that it's just a game and my character can run and walk the same at 10% and at 100% health. Well... I say no more. 
  
I tried my best to achieve that and Underdog is presented and concieved as a whole. Meaning, that the animations for the most part depend on eachother, but they can be seperated if you wish so and *replaced with your own favorite animation packs*. Also, I made the animations having a modded game in mind because, to put it simply, it's 2021 and many wheels have allready been invented. Attack animations and effects of all kinds. Tools and frameworks that simply make the game a lot better and my animations are introduced into the game having maximum compatibilty in mind.

**Underdog 2.0 intro :**
  
Spoiler
  
I can have spectacular battles and climactic adventures and quests, and I can kill enemies with a million different ways, ok.
  
(Brief pause and a big thank you to all the animators/mod authors out there, doing amazing thinks for the rest of us common folks , allowing us to only have to click the download button).
  
Then I go to town and absolutely nothing has changed. People barely change anything regarding your accomplishments no matter how big or small your contribution. Skyrim has a very barebones disposition system that isn’t utilized as much as I wanted. Did you know that bandits looking to cut your throat are considered acquaintances by the game?
  
For example I can relate with Arngeir giving you the finger every time he sees you, if you decide to kill their favorite leader.
  
I defeated Alduin, can I get some acknowledgment of that?
  
Are Maven, Rolff and Nazeem really that bad?
  
I am your leader now. How about that?
  
Are we friends? Lovers?
  
Hey buddy, do you know me from somewhere? Oh, right. I just saved your ass back there!!
  
Enter Underdog 2.0 :)
  
  
  
﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿﻿ ﻿﻿![](https://i.imgur.com/c2jAWpb.png)[/left]**Just install with your favorite mod manager**, but keep an eye on the requierments that some animations might have.
  
**Underdog is very simple in its core and contains only animations. Underdog won’t and can’t break your game in any way if you install/uninstall it anytime you want.** Heck you don’t even need to run Nemesis for it to work.
  
  
  
**Requirements :**
  
**Hard :**
  
[Open Animation Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92109)
  
  
**Soft :**
  
Check the descriptions in the fomod for when specific mods are required. You probably already have most of these installed anyway but here goes.[True Directional Movement](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51614) for any movement animation. 
  
[Disable Turn Animation SE | AE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78106) for any movement animation affecting the player.
  
[Wade In Water](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42854) or better yet [Wade in Water ESLified](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/102898) and [Wade in water Redone](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71418) for dive and walk on water animations.
  
[Open Animation Replacer - Detection Plugin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/104806) many if not all sitting, greeting, idle animations need this. *Underdog v3.0 is setup to use v2.1.3.*
  
[Scrolling Speed 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70455) or [Scrolling Speed NG (SKSE Plugin)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/154251) for crawl and sneaky sneak animations. The sneak movement module benefits from this too, but it's not mandatory any more.
  
[Immersive Wenches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/595) or/and [Basic Wenches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/117310) benefit from the Wench Walk.
  
[Dirt and Blood - Dynamic Visual effects](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38886), Scratch idles play when PC is dirty.
  
  
~~[Spell Perk Item Distributor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869) For the sitting fear animations~~ *Not needed any more. Updating mid playthrough should be safe.*
  
~~[Reanimated NPC Animations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/79079) I have deleted the meshes folder for my game and haven't tested how both mods act together. I use it to define the Reanimated, so we only need everything but the meshes folders. Required for the Reanimated-Zombie animations.~~ *Not needed any more. Updating mid playthrough should be safe.*
  
~~[Sleeping NPCs Detector](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106081) for the walking someone is sleeping animation~~ *Not needed any more. Updating mid playthrough should be safe.*
  
  
  
**Strongly Recommended**
  
[Animation Queue Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/82395) recommended
  
[3rd Person Walk Fix Redux](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72892) recommended
  
  
  
**CHECK THAT YOU DON' T HAVE**Spoiler
  
[Wounds Injury Animations - Leg animations IDLE WALKING AND RUN port from UNDERDOG](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85230) Might have compatibility issues. Haven't tested
  
[Underdog - Serana and all vampires Injury Animation fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65072) not needed any more. Disable if you have it
  
  
  
**If an animation is missbehaving try OAR’s ingame preview ability to pinpoint which animation played in conjuction with [Show Animation Command](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/74034) or [Show Animation Command NG - SKSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/104356) to see which animation played in the console and please take the time to report it in the comments or bug section.**
  
  
How it works :
  
Spoiler***Scrolling speed 2 / Scrolling Speed NG:*** Skyrim uses two states when moving. Running and walking. SS2 affects only the running condition by applying a speed debuff on the player. Thankfully the game recognizes this and when you slow down the walk animation starts to blend in. BUT, you are technically still considered to be running. Long story short in order to trigger the crawl animation you need to be crouched/sneak/Ctrl button, not running and speed scrolled all the way down to the slowest setting (ingame condition speed<30). And to be as thorough as I can, having pressed Caps lock to slow your speed to a walk, will NOT trigger the crawl animation. That’s it! 
  
***Dive animation :*** uses the slow magic effect introduced by wade in water (and the submerged condition as to not jump in shallow splashes of water, still not perfect). If it doesn’t trigger for you then you need to check mods, probably with a jumping theme, that contain folders with higher numbers than the ones I used, which means that they have higher priority than mine. 
  
***NPCIdleFluffRemover.esp :*** is gone since v2.5. I have adjusted the animation frequency taking into account the existing vanila animations.
  
  
  
Known Issues :
  
Spoiler
  
-Old man walk and Sad walk special animations has a wierd snap when transitioning from other animations. I still like the animation, so I included it.
  
-~~NO~~ SOME SKIRTS were harmed in the making of this animation pack. No seriously, the skirts are minimaly animated, because... reasons. If the need arises I might find the courage to adjust this. Damn you Vilkas…
  
-Some animations use transitional animations, for example the vanilla sitting idles are 6-8 main animations and there are 4 more transitional animations leading from one to the other. This becomes impossible to cover the more animations there are, ~~so expect animations that use transitions to "snap" when they switch.~~ *there should be less snapping with OAR's build in blend function.*
  
-Some clipping issues with objects mainly. The one that comes to mind is the Laughing hard sitting animation, that doesn't take into account an object, like a table, in front of the chair.
  
-Some walk/run animations might feel off for lack of a better word, probably due to different speeds the NPCs use. I tried my best to minimize this but, checking with OAR's Animation Log, the game spams, amazingly a lot and at a very fast pace, animations that most of the times it doesn't even make sense. For example most of the guards spam walk and run animations when they are moving, seemingly at a walking pace. *This is mostly alleviated for v2.5+.*
  
-The injured run animation has some sliding. I tried fixing it to no avail.
