[font=Trebuchet MS]**﻿There is a great alternative to poser hotkey plus and probably the best of the best mod for taking a screenshot it's Screen Archer Menu (SAM) by [[b]Maxie](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/maximusmaxy/about-me)**﻿﻿ just join the discord and you can get access to this amazing mod , this mod work like magic literally , like you have a 3D software such blender inside skyrim basically you can move object , resize object , move character , pose character yeah even make a new poses from zero in game , edit pose , edit expression , add light , edit light , disable light , move camera very precisely and save that as a camera preset and the list go on[/b][/font]

It can load any pose that you install , of course you still need to run nemesis for poses mod to work but this will work even without using poser hotkey plus just select the poses you want in SAM menu and it's okay to use both at the same time like loading your pose with poser hotkey plus and do the adjustment with SAM

The magic is you can adjust every bone in the character body in game , so you can make a adjustment to a pose say no to clipping and always have a perfect pose in every screenshot because sometime you can have a height different between the character , clothing and body type so you can just adjust the hands and finger or neck anything you want whatever you want﻿

Usually when you already spent so much time making a cute character , you want to take a nice looking screenshot of her you searching for perfect spot with decent light source in the game hoping for the best and sometime it's not enough not what you wanted feel like your imagination is limited by that light in that location like the light type , direction , distance , intensity , color or location but with SAM you can shape the light into anything you wanted and make a decent result with it , because light is the most important thing it will make your character look great and interesting so instead of blasting your character with it try to make the light more subtle and defined idk the word for it i'm not artist but try to make it easier for the eye to focus on the subject , don't be afraid of shadow sometime it can make your shot more cinematic or use your own preferences
