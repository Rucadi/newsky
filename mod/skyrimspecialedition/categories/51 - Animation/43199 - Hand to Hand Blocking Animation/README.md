Simple SE port of Zartar's Hand to Hand Blocking Animation in Oldrim.
  
  
The animation can be used together with Dynamic Animation Replacer or Nemesis PCEA, your choice.
  
In vanilla you can't block while in hand-to-hand combat, so to actually see this animation in your game you need a mod like Dual Wield Parrying.
  
If you're using DServant's Combat Gameplay Overhaul then you don't need Dual Wield Parrying as this module is already included in that mod.
  
  
This animation is for **3rd person only**, if you want to see it in first person you need Improved Camera or a similar 1st person camera overhaul
  
  
It was created by Zartar and uploaded by TankIsKing
  
I simply ported it. I don't own this animation and I didn't create it, all credits goes to Zartar for making it and TankIsKing for uploading it to Oldrim in the first place.
