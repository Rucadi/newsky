**-Added 3 Attack Animation**
  
  
  
I don't know why, but after adjusting the weapon's center of gravity, it started flying around, causing the four animations I previously created to no longer work properly in the game. In the end, I had to recreate a new animation without adjusting the weapon's position. Additionally, I lost the files of the old animations, so this time there are only three new animations.
