All the animations I made, I thought it would be a good idea to put them all together in one place but it's quite messy.
  
  
Weapon animations do not contain previews, I have to do them.
  
They are just movements, they do not contain attack animations except for magic and staff
  
  
I spend a lot of time to do the previews because I always change characters and look for armor to match and look cool, a lot of unnecessary stuff but I can't help it, so I'll leave it for later.
  
  
Most animations use DAR so NPCs don't use them, but you can simply take the files and put them in the animations folder and the NPCs will use them.
  
  
I wanted to make the page more complete but I never have time, it's better to put it like this and improve over time if possible, otherwise I'll never put it up.
  
The pose previews are incomplete.
  
The name of the killmove animations does not describe the animations, it is just the original name of the files.
  
  
Everyone has permission to use any of my animations, you don't have to wait for me to approve because it could take months for me to respond.
