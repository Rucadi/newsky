Here's a cute belly-laying idle replacer for mod-added corgi NPCs. This was a request from [TateTaylorOH](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/61720101) from a while back that I finally had some time to bring to life, mainly for their Gladys/Merlin corgi companions. Do please note that, usually, doing requests is not on my agenda, but it may depend on if an idea sparks my interest.
  
  
Partially compatible with my [Doge Cheems animation replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/125043)
