# Quiet Mammoth Babies - No Camera Shake - OAR DAR versions

I started working on a project involving baby mammoths, and quickly became annoyed with the camera shake effect when they were moving. They aren't that large, so it was distracting and unimmersive.
  
  
So... I converted the mammoth animation hkx files to xml, reduced the camera shake to zero, converted them back, and then learned OAR conditioning for animal actors. I created conditions covering the mods listed below. I am unaware of any other mods that create baby mammoths, but if they use Mihail's or SkyTEST as a base, they should be covered as well.  Once I completed the OAR version, I created a DAR version as well, to give people options. I do recommend the OAR version simply because you can see more info about it in the in-game interface for OAR, but they both work.
  
  
There is no plugin, so it's safe to install/uninstall whenever.  Hope you like it!
