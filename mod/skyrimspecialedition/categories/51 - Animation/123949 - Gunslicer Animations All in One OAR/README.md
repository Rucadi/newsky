This pack contains [Gunslicer's](https://www.patreon.com/Gunslicer) ﻿animation replacers configured for use with Open Animation Replacer. This replaces animations for the female character character.
  
  
On top of the original animations by Gunslicer, there are some OAR config changes to improve condition triggers as well as some subjectively improved variations of existing animations. Currently only weapons-sheathed sneak and two handed sneak have adjusted variations, but there may be more to come later.
  
  
fomod installer includes links to preview videos for some animations hosted on a [github pages site](https://gs-oar.github.io/gunslicer-oar/index.html), but so far it does not cover all of the animations currently included in the pack. Preview video submissions are welcomed as well as suggestions for OAR config changes or even animation changes if you wish to have them bundled in this pack, you can find guidelines on how to do so on the github repository readme [here](https://github.com/gs-oar/gunslicer-oar).
