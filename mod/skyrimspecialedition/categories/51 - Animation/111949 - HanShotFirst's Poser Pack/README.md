I've found a lot of pose packs for female characters but haven't ever found a lot for males so I made some. Run FNIS/Nemesis after install.
  
  
To use these poses, you can either use [Photo Mode](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/91701) or you can import them through [Poser Hotkeys](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22860) (install the mod and then run PoserGenData.exe).
  
  
That's pretty much it, it's a pose pack, I don't feel like it needs a novel for a description.
