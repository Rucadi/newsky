Requires: 
  
Dynamic Animation Replacer
  
Animation Motion Revolution
  
  
  
Why add these animations?
  
Original riekling only has one regular attack animation. The missile riekling just stands still and repeats throwing in one single animation. So this mod adds new ways for them to attack. Sometimes these little creatures can use their swift movement to turn the tables.
  
  
Can apply to any creature in riekling skeleton, such as Mihail's fogling.
  
  
**Updates: melee riekling are already faster than video now. Due to the arrow's speed, haven't changed missile riekling.**
