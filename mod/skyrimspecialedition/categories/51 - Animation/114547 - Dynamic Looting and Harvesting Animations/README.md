COMPATIBILITY

[/font]****Harvest flora:** Almost all vanilla and DLC flora will have dynamic animations. Items harvested from the plants will be displayed using IED as long as they have "transforms" configs. Mods not patched won't be displayed by IED, but the animations will play regardless.
  
  
Check the KID and FLM files to see the mods supported.
  
IED configs can be created with the PapyrusUtil .json file, but the process is a bit tedious.
  
  
Compatible with [Immersive Interactions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47670), but disable the "Harvest" option for better results.
  
Compatible with [Favor Jobs Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40145).
  
Compatible with [Woodcutting Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53538).
  
  
To harvest mead from barrels, firewood from woodpiles and antlers from the walls as shown in the description, install [Dynamic Things Alternative](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60741).
  
  
Probably incompatible with [EatingSleepingDrinking - KuNeruNomu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65868), try to disable the harvesting options from that mod.
  
  
**Loot container:** it's recommended to use the animations with a mod that unpauses menus, such as [Skyrim Souls](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27859).
