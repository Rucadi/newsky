Relaxed Sneak Animations
  
by Everglaid
  
  
Special Edition | [Legendary Edition](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/103394/)﻿
  
  
Simple edit of the vanilla sneaking animations for a raised center of gravity, straighter posture with arms reeled in and no bent wrists.
  
Unisex, covers idles and movement.

**Requirements:** None
  
  
**Recommended:** [360 Movement Behaviour](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33139)﻿ & [Combat Gameplay Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33767)﻿ (for better animation blending & procedural leaning, present in video)
  
  
**Compatibility:** Replaces/will be replaced with any of these files:
  
sneakmtidle.hkx
  
sneak1hm\_idle.hkx
  
sneakrun[8 directions].khx
  
sneakwalk[8 directions].hkx
  
sneak\_turn[turntype].hkx
  
  
Feel free to mix and match with other mods that do the same.
  
I didn't touch attack animations for compatibility & hitbox reasons (inexperience, and bows are scary.)
