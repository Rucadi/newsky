**Draw Fix - Move Equip Animation Fix**
  
*Fixes stiff upper body when drawing weapons*
  
  
Skyrim uses a single, fixed upper-body animation when drawing a weapon.
  
This animation is designed to look natural **only while standing still**.
  
When triggered during movement, it causes the character’s upper body to **lock in place**, resulting in an awkward and unnatural appearance.
  
  
**Draw Fix** detects this situation and:
  
  
> When drawing a weapon while moving → cancels the animation → instantly transitions to combat-ready idle

  
  
This simple logic provides a smooth and seamless solution to a long-standing animation issue.
  
  
This mod is built with a **lightweight script** that has **no performance impact**,
  
and it is flagged as **ESL** for maximum compatibility.
  
  
**Compatibility**
  

  
* **✔️ Fully compatible** with most animation mods
**✔️ Not affected by 1st-person mods** (Draw Fix only activates in 3rd-person view)
  
* **✔️ Compatible with mods that change equip behavior**
**⚠️ Should also work with equip animation behavior mods**, but further testing is recommended.
