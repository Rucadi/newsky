# Werewolf Feral Beast Run

There were several mods to make your werewolf run more like a wolf for oldrim, but since none were ported to SSE I made one for myself and figured I'd share!
  
  
  
The main file **Werewolf Feral Run** replaces the 2-leg run animation with the 4-leg sprint animation, with fixed leg spaz!
  
For those linked here by Teria23, use **Werewolf Feral Run for Oldrim** under **Optional Files**. :)
  
  
Other Optional files include:
  
  
**Human Werewolf Sprint**, which does the opposite and replaces the 4-leg sprint with the 2-leg run animation.
  
**Vanilla Werewolf Sprint Fix** is *just* the leg spaz fix for vanilla 4-leg sprint. *(This is also included in the main file.)*
  
Think vanilla werewolves are too slow? **Faster Werewolves** increases their movement speed to match vanilla horses!
  
  
If you're looking for even more fixes for vanilla werewolf animations, check out [Slightly Less Crappy Werewolf Animations](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/8875-slightly-less-crappy-werewolf-animations/)﻿ by [MadMansGun](https://www.loverslab.com/profile/71862-madmansgun/)﻿!
  
  
  
Many thanks to [Jumbuck87](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/67763501) for his brainstorming and assistance in helping me figure out how to edit animations!
  
Without his determination and encouragement, this mod would still have the spazzy leg and terrible turning animations of v1.0!

**Compatibility**
  
As far as I know, none of the major werewolf mods change running animations, so it should be compatible with anything, but if you find anything let me know~
  
  
These are just loose files and are perfectly safe to install/uninstall at any time.
  
  
**Known Issues**It seems the run animation is somehow linked to the walk animation for werewolves, so this will make the walking animation *very* stuttery.
  
  
  
  
If anyone does know how to make custom/better animations for this I'd happily let them take over! :)
