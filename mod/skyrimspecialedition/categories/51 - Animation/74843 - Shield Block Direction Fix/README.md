It's not vanilla issue, it might happen while using specific animation mods. What this mod does is simply override shield walking animations with vanilla ones, which work absolutely fine. And this is why it's called bandaid fix, because it's pretty much brute force method, but if you have no idea how to edit animations (like me) you are in right place.
  
Severity of the issue depends on specific load order.
  
  
Requires DAR, install or uninstall any time.
  
  
**New in version 2.0**Thanks to OAR this is no longer bandaid fix. Animation will be forced to the one with proper direction only when blocking, meaning your custom animation will be used most of the time, instead of being fully replaced. Return to your custom animation might be a little delayed, but this is nothing I can fix on my end.
