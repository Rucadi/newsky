A port of Billyys table animations to OStim Standalone. Unlike the OStim NG conversions of Billyys animations these tie directly into the into the vanilla idles and don't need an Addon Hub. Load order doesn't matter since there should be no file conflicts.
  
  
Only works with Nemesis. There is no FNIS version.
