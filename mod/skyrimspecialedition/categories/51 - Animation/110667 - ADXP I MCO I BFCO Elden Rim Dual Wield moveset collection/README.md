Thanks to [bosn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/113099513) for making "[Dynamic Grip MCO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/110031)", my "[Dual Wield Revolution](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/102849)" can be retired, with Dynamic Grip MCO you can no longer download DWR
  
  
The animation was made with reference to elden rim, adding Dual Wield animations for all weapons, including 2hm weapons, and some special weapons such as Scythes, Colossal Swords, Heavy Thrusting Swords, Curvedsword, etc. (refer to the video for more details)
  
  
(Currently missing BattleaxesDW, I'll update it later)
  
  
  
Usage:
  
Directly install the animation, and refer to the instructions of "[Dynamic Grip MCO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/110031)".
  
  
If your animation doesn't work, please check the priority order of the OAR folder to make sure it's normal, and put the DW animation after other animations as much as possible.
  
  
On special weapons:
  
Some of the special weapons come from [Cosmofujia](https://www.patreon.com/fujiacosmo), you can download the weapons he made and use them directly, you can also use weapon keywords to differentiate these animations, for example swors and Greatswords and Colossal Swords use three different animations, just like elden rim
  
  
About SCAR：
  
Since NPCs don't switch DW modes, I didn't make SCARs, and the OAR conditions for these animations come with a player qualification that others can't use
  
If you want NPCs to use 1hm DW mode SCAR, then use my old elden rim animations for swords, daggers, and so on
