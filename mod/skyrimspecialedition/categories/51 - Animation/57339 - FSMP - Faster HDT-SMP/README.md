**FSMP** **is*****Faster HDT-SMP***(Faster HDT - Skinned Mesh Physics)**FSMP** **[b]for AE, SE, VR, GOG** **i**s now over three years old!![/b]

The Epic version won't be supported as long as SKSE doesn't support it.
  
  
  
Hello everybody, this is an SKSE plugin allowing **advanced physics** to be applied to actors via XML configuration files.
  
**This mod massively improves performance over the original HDT-SMP, and replaces it totally.**

As the FSMP MCM is now provided with FSMP, you must uninstall the previous [FSMP MCM mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/104462)﻿.
  
 Make sure that the esp remains in the same place in your load order to avoid problems with your save.

**FAQ**
  
  
Q: *The version is greyed out in the installer, i can't choose anything.*
  
A: Look closer, especially if you have dark mode on - the version is chosen automatically, there's a dot to the left of your game version
  
  
Q: *The installer says "game version unsupported".*
  
A: Disable Fomod+ (MO2 menu: Tools - Settings - at the bottom of the Plugins tab), restart MO2, install FSMP
  
  
Q: *My crash log says FSMP crashed my game.*
  
A: unlikely, see sticky post in the forum [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57339/?tab=forum&topic_id=10699018)﻿
  
  
Q: *I get lots of popups when i start the game.*
  
A: You're missing a required mod, check that you have [ConsoleutilSSE NG](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76649)﻿, [PapyrusUtil](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13048)﻿ and **[JContainers SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/16495)﻿** installed, then reinstall FSMP
  
  
Q: *My follower's SMP gets disabled randomly.*
  
A: In the FSMP MCM, Simplification tab, uncheck "Auto adjust max number of SMP NPCs".
  
  
Q: *What about the original [HDT-SMP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30872)﻿ mod?﻿*
  
A: FSMP is a complete replacement and enhancement of that mod. HDT-SMP only works on game version 1.5.97 and is a lot slower than FSMP. Do not install it together with FSMP.
  
  
Q: *Physics don't work!*
  
A: Please [join our discord](https://discord.gg/tvWRzcKPV3)﻿, we'll try to get you there.
  
  
Q: *I need more information about FSMP!*
  
A: There is a full manual in the FSMP mod folder (Filename: FSMPU - The FSMP User Guide V1.6.0.pdf).
  
  
Q: *Where do i file a bug report?*
  
A: You can submit them [on github](https://github.com/DaymareOn/hdtSMP64/issues).

Etiquette
  
  
SpoilerSo far, the response to the usefulness of this mod has been overwhelmingly positive, and I must say that I'm touched.
  
I really didn't think that such a response would happen.
  
  
I'll ask users to be excellent to each others, dudes and dudettes, and I'll be a little bit more restrictive in my moderation of the comments.
  
First, I will hide comments when the answer is in the description, or if the question has already been answered in the comments.
  
Second, I will hide comments insulting others or me, even if the insult is implicit, as long as the insult isn't linked to the work provided by modders.
  
Third, I will block users insulting others or me, even if the insult is implicit, when the insult is linked to the work provided by modders.
  
Finally, I will block users disputing the DP repartition agreed with the authors (see the permissions if interested).
  
I will apply this moderation policy on all my mods.
  
  
Of course, I'll be moderate, playful banter isn't insult, and I'll make sure the description is informative enough.
  
  
sidfu is from now on blocked from my mods.
  
  
My heartfelt thanks to everybody who sees value in this mod!
