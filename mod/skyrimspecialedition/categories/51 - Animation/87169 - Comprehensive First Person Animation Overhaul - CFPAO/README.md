[left]﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ ﻿ ﻿﻿So... what is this mod?[/left]
  
 ﻿The long and short of it is this — this mod replaces almost every single vanilla animation from the first person perspective, and even adds some unique ones depending on what weapon or school of magic you're using. ﻿I set out to create this mod in early March 2023, after I saw [ShoryukenBruh's mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45177)﻿﻿ and I thought, "huh, I kinda want to try doing that too." They gave me the necessary inspiration to get this started (and they, in turn, were inspired by [5poiler's mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20375)﻿﻿, which kind of makes them the grandparent of my own). And thus, here we are.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿
  
**![](https://i.imgur.com/4ClSBBe.png)﻿﻿**Before you do anything, make sure you install [Open Animation Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92109)﻿ if you haven't already. Definitely a hard requirement. If you don't get it, this mod probably just won't do anything.
  
  
Do note that this mod has fully switched over to OAR and **no longer supports DAR**. If you're still using DAR for whatever reason, you MUST switch to OAR for this mod to work.
  
  
**1.** ﻿Download with your mod manager of choice.
  
  
 **﻿ ﻿ ﻿ ﻿OR**
  
  
**1.** Download the mod and extract the .zip file.
  
**2.** Open up the extracted folder.
  
**3**. Copy the 'meshes' folder to your Skyrim's Data folder. If Windows asks if you want to merge folders, say yes.
  
  
﻿And you're done. That's all it takes. This mod doesn't add any new animations, just replaces existing ones, so you shouldn't need to run Nemesis or FNIS or anything like that. Can be installed or uninstalled at any time with no consequences. [It just works](https://tenor.com/view/todd-howard-it-just-works-bethesda-this-all-just-works-gif-20598651) right out of the box.
  
  
**![](https://i.imgur.com/0Wdfn9S.png)﻿****1. Is this ever going to get updated?**
  
Yes. It just happens very slowly (sorry).
  
  
**2. The FOMOD is gone! How do I switch between options?**
  
With the switch to OAR, the FOMOD is no longer necessary. All options can be swapped between seamlessly through OAR's in-game menu without having to reinstall or restart anything. Simply open the menu while the game is running with Shift+O, switch to User Mode at the top, open CFPAO, and you are free to enable/disable any option you please.
  
  
Remember to open each submod you changed and press "Save submod config," otherwise you'll have to do it every time you reopen the game. This button can be found by opening the submod and scrolling to the bottom of it (NOT the mod itself, the submod, meaning the "option" itself. For example, if you enable the War Axe Attacks: Hit Stop option, click on that option and scroll down until you see "Save submod config").
  
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/ZsSBRaK.png)
  
  
**3. How do I save my changes in OAR's menu?**
  
See #2 above.
  
  
**4. OAR's menu is too confusing, I don't want to use it!**
  
It takes like 5 minutes to figure out, *and* I already explained it with #2. I am not bringing the FOMOD back — please stop asking. I've poured hundreds of hours into this mod and expect nothing in return, so you can at least meet me halfway and do this simple thing for me. And, because I know someone will think this, I am *not* intentionally mocking or belittling people by saying that.
  
  
**5. My FOV keeps getting reset every time I open the map/character menu!**
  
This isn't a fault of my mod at all but I still see it getting asked here all the time, so I'll address two fixes for it that I've seen.
  
  

  
* You can input FOV X X into the console in-game. Obviously replace X with your desired FOV, and yes, input it twice. This will set both the viewmodel and world FOV to match, which should fix the issue (thank you to [TheCrumbinator3](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/9266680)﻿ for posting this fix in the comments).

  

  
* Alternatively, you can go and download the mod SkyTweak (it's only on LE right now, but there's a guide here on the SE nexus that will tell you how to convert it, which is super easy to do, and yes it still works with the most recent version of Skyrim). Once installed, open up the game and head into the SkyTweak MCM menu. Under the INI category, set both the first and third person FOV to your desired value. This is the solution I use and it works wonders, and you don't have to reinput the value every time you reload the game which is a nice touch.

  
**6. Does this work with Dynamic Animation Replacer?**
  
No, CFPAO no longer supports DAR. With 1.5, I fully made the switch to OAR, and DAR does not support OAR mods so you MUST install OAR if you want to use this mod — you *cannot* use DAR anymore.
  
  
**7. Is this compatible with third person mods?**
  
Yes. My mod only affects first person animations.
  
  
**8. Will you ever make a third person mod that matches up with these animations?**
  
Not likely. This mod actually did get its roots as a third person mod, but I was wildly unhappy with how the animations came out and so switched to first person.
  
  
**9. How come I can see a certain update in the changelog but it's not available to download?**
  
That's just a preview of the next update to come. It's partly so people will know what to expect from the next update, but mostly because I will definitely forget everything I added in by the time I'm ready to release the update and write the full changelog.
  
  
**10. Does this mod work with Animated Armory / Heavy Armory, etc.?**
  
Yes. Pretty much every other first person animation mod that uses DAR/OAR *should* overwrite my animations when necessary.
  
  
**11. I don't know what animations to select!**
  
Just pick whichever ones you like the look of (remember, there are previews at the bottom of the page!). If you need some help choosing, my personal selections are as follows:
  
  

  
* Sword/dual swords on hip
All follow through options
  
* Dagger alternate reverse grip
Dual daggers alternate grip
  
* Greatsword mordhau power attacks
Bow draw from back
  
* Unarmed jab punches
All movement options
  

  
But I'm not your dad, so just pick whatever ones you end up liking the most!
  
  
**12. My character's wrists look really deformed when not wearing gloves/gauntlets!**
  
This is most noticeable with body mods like CBBE. It's not really something I'm keen to fix because it's such a niche condition to see it (not wearing gloves/gauntlets). I would probably have to change nigh-on every single animation to accommodate this and that would likely result in a bunch of very stiff-looking animations, which is not a worthy trade-off in my opinion.
  
  
This is an issue inherent with the body model itself and I cannot fix it with the tools I have available.
  
  
**13. Which version of Skyrim does this work with?**
  
So, I originally thought that it would just work with all of them (besides Legendary Edition), but apparently version 1.6.640 doesn't like CFPAO for whatever reason. So if you're having issues with the game just not loading at all with CFPAO installed, maybe try updating Skyrim if it's at 1.6.640.
  
  
**14. Does this work with 1.x.xxxx?**See #10 above, please.
  
  
**15. Can I disable the camera movement?**
  
No. It's baked into the animations, unfortunately, and there's no way (that I know of) to get rid of them on your end. I added camera movement for attacks in 1.4 because so many people were asking me to implement it. If I tried to keep up with a second version that *doesn't* have camera movement, it'd nearly double my work load, which is big enough as is. So, the only thing you can do to 'disable' it is use an older version of the mod (1.3 or earlier). The final version of the mod will include a second file that includes animations without camera movement.
  
  
**16. [Mod-added weapon] isn't lined up properly with the hands!**
  
And it will continue to be so. I'm not going to make a bespoke patch for every mod-added weapon under the sun, sorry.
  
  
**17. I can't see my shoulders when drawing a bow!**
  
You're probably using a mod-added armor piece that doesn't include the shoulders in the first-person viewmodel. There's nothing you or I can do about it, unfortunately.
  
  
**18. Ebony armor blocks my screen!**
  
There is nothing I can do about this. That's a model problem, not an animation problem. It's a "feature" of Skyrim. You could try using a mod like [this](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/123378?tab=files).
  
  
**19. I have a mod that puts the shield on the back, but I still see it in first person. How can I fix this?**
  
Those kinds of mods only work in third person, and as far as I know there's no way of replicating it in first person. I'd recommend just disabling all the movement options if it bothers you that much.
  
  
**20. Does CFPAO work with [Archery Gameplay Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24296?tab=description)?**
  
Most of it should be compatible. The only possible issue is that since AGO doesn't use DAR or OAR, all of my bow animations will replace the first person ones from AGO, which means you won't get things like the arrow stab or pre-nocked arrows. If that's fine with you, then great, but if not, I'd recommend just disabling my bow animations in CPFAO's installer so you can get everything else you want from CFPAO while still keeping all the functionality and animations from AGO.
  
  
**21. I installed the sprinting animations, but I don't see them when I have my weapons sheathed!**
  
You've probably got Improved Camera installed, right? If so, try unchecking "overwrite vanilla arm on movement" (or something along those lines) in Improved Camera's in-game menu.
  
  
**22. OAR gives me a warning about overlapping priorities!**
  
This is a non-issue, caused by most of the folders sharing the same priority. None of the conditions overlap though, so it should theoretically be fine to ignore.
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/T8HOxtg.png)﻿
  
**1. Some power attacks transition weirdly and my hands teleport around for a second before it starts.**
  
This is not my fault. This is part of Skyrim, and it's noticeable even with the vanilla animations. My guess is the game detects the attack input, plays the attack animation, before it detects the input was held down and quickly switches to the power attack animation, causing the jank.
  
  
**2. When using [Precision - Accurate Melee Collisions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72347),﻿ certain animations land twice.**This is my fault. If an animation is too slow it'll land a second hit as it recovers. This mainly affects a select few attacks like the bow bash and sword power bash, but since they're bash attacks I'm not really worried about it. As far as I know, none of the light and power attacks are affected by this.
  
  
**3. My weapons/hands are too close/I can see weird things happening at the corners of the screen.**
  
This is because I designed these animations to look good at fields of vision of around 80-110 (I used FOV 100 during testing). I guess I should've designed them around FOV 75, which is Skyrim's base FOV but, well, uh...
  
  

  
* You can input fov X X into the console in-game. Obviously replace X with your desired FOV, and yes, input it twice. This will set both the viewmodel and world FOV to match, which should fix the issue (thank you to [TheCrumbinator3](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/9266680)﻿ for posting this fix in the comments).

  

  
* Alternatively, you can go and download the mod SkyTweak (it's only on LE right now, but there's a guide here on the SE nexus that will tell you how to convert it, which is super easy to do, and yes it still works with the most recent version of Skyrim). Once installed, open up the game and head into the SkyTweak MCM menu. Under the INI category, set both the first and third person FOV to your desired value. This is the solution I use and it works wonders, and you don't have to reinput the value every time you reload the game which is a nice touch.

  
**4. Certain mod-added spells don't have the unique animations that they should.**
  
This mainly applies to shock, soul trap, fear, frenzy, and pacify spells. Because of the way I had to set these up, mod-added spells that use these spell effects very likely won't get the unique animations. They'll probably just revert to the default ones from this mod. I haven't done any testing, but I'm sure this would be an issue for almost any major magic mods like Apocalypse or Odin.
  
  
**5. Wrists are deformed during certain animations when not wearing gloves/gauntlets, most notably the magic and unarmed idles.**
  
I'm sorry, but this would be much too tedious to fix right now. I would have to edit hundreds of animations, and it would probably end up causing an issue with something else. Simplest fix is just to wear gloves/gauntlets.
  
  
This is an issue inherent with the body model itself and I cannot fix it with the tools I have available.
  
  
**6. There are no sneak animations.**
  
I know, I know, not very 'comprehensive' anymore, is it? For the longest time, these were buggy and didn't want to work. But finally, with the help of another kind modder, I've figured it out! Expect sneak animations at some point in the future, probably 1.6.
  
  
**7. There are no dual sword + dagger / sword + axe / sword + mace etc. animations.**
  
This probably won't change for the time being. There's just too many combinations. There'd have to be separate animation sets for a sword in the right hand and an axe in the left, a sword in the right and a mace in the left, a sword in the right and a dagger in the left, and the same thing for mace in the right and so on and so forth. Maybe one day, but not now.
  
  
**8. There are no new first person killmove animations.**
  
And it will probably stay that way for a while. I just haven't figured out how to do it yet. I've seen videos recently of custom killmoves, so I know it *is* possible.
  
  
**9. When I equip or unequip dual magic while moving my arms teleport to the top of the screen for a second.**~~Okay, so I have absolutely ZERO idea what's going on with this one. I figured I was missing a very specific animation (if this is the case I have yet to find out which one) or maybe the animations got exported weirdly. Was not the latter, as I went back and re-exported all of the equip and unequip animations and updated all instances of them, but no luck. If someone has an idea of why this is happening, please let me know, because it's driving me crazy.~~
  
  
I still don't get what's happening with this. I did EXTENSIVE testing and trial and error trying to fix it, and it seems to be caused by having both the left hand and right walking/running animations being played at the same time. But when I export the right hand animations with both hands up and get rid of the left hand one, only the right hand gets animated properly. So for now, until I can properly fix it, I'm just getting rid of the custom walking/running animations. I don't think the vanilla ones are that bad, so they should hold you over for now.
  
  
**10. Animation doesn't play properly when sprinting with fists raised.**
  
~~Probably just an animation I forgot to add/replace. Will be out for next update.~~That was not the issue, not sure what's going on here. Will do more digging.
  
  
**11. Sheathed movement does not play when using Improved Camera or similar mods.**
  
In Improved Camera's in-game menu, uncheck an option called "overwrite vanilla arm on movement" (or something along those lines).
  
  
**12. There are no new animations for running with magic equipped.**
  
See #9 please.
  
  
**13. I have a mod that puts the shield on the back, but I still see it in first person.**
  
Those kinds of mods only work in third person, and as far as I know there's no way of replicating it in first person. I'd recommend just disabling all the movement options if it bothers you that much.
  
  
**14. Scoped bows aren't lined up properly.**
  
And they probably never will be. The amount of work and tedium required to fix this is too much for me. I'd have to guess where the scope is, and keep fine tuning the hand positions until it looks perfect and I really don't want to do that. Plus, I don't like scoped bows anyways. Sorry.
  
  
**15. Ebony armor blocks my vision in first person.**
  
Not really my fault (I guess it kind of is). My mod doesn't edit models or textures or anything like that so that's just a "feature" of vanilla Skyrim. You could try using a mod like [this](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/123378?tab=files)﻿.
  
  
**16. I can't see my torso armor/upper arms in first person.**
  
You're probably running CBBE or some other body mod. Not sure about any other similar mods, but it's been confirmed at least once that CBBE might be involved in making torso armor invisible in first person for whatever reason. If you're experiencing this issue and have CBBE installed, try disabling it first.
  
  
**17. My weapon/hand flickers for a moment when I stop moving.**This is a weird bug that only seems to happen at higher framerates. If it bothers you, try limiting your FPS to 120, or 60 if that doesn't work.
  
  
**18. My game keeps crashing on startup.**
  
Apparently version 1.6.640 doesn't like CFPAO for whatever reason. So if you're having issues with the game just not loading at all with CFPAO installed, maybe try updating Skyrim if it's at 1.6.640.
  
  
**19. When using a one-handed melee weapon and equipping a spell in the offhand, I can no longer attack.**
  
Weird bug introduced in 1.5. No idea what's causing it but I will do some testing.
  
  
**20. Shields cover too much of the screen.**
  
Yep. There's nothing you can do on your end but wait for me to fix it, unfortunately.
  
**![](https://i.imgur.com/9nA9jRp.png)﻿**[XP32 Maximum Skeleton:](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1988)﻿﻿ According to the bug tracker, this mod causes a lot of weird issues with my mod, but the way to fix it seems to be reinstalling XP32 and only selecting the default options. I run it in my own load order with all the default options and it works fine.﻿
  
  
[Joy of Perspective:](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9358)﻿﻿ From what I've heard, this mod causes a lot of problems with mine, so I'd avoid it if you plan to download my mod.﻿ **Even if you *did* have it**, then removed it, there might be some lingering files so please make sure you **do a clean uninstall of it!**
  
  
[CBBE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/198)﻿ **(possibly other body mods as well):** Apparently the deformation of the wrists is a LOT worse with CBBE than with the vanilla body. It's only noticeable when your character isn't wearing gloves/gauntlets so I don't think it's a huge deal. Also, CBBE supposedly (I think through editing the meshes) makes vanilla torso armors invisible in first person with this mod. No idea why.﻿
  
  
[SkySA's first person addon:](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31390?tab=description)﻿﻿﻿ If you're experiencing issues with the animations not working at all (besides the equip/unequip and idle animations), see if you've got this lurking somewhere in your load order and try getting rid of it.﻿﻿
  
  
[Improved Camera:](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93962?tab=description)﻿﻿﻿ This one **does work** with CFPAO, but you just have to remember to **enable the dedicated fix in Improved Camera's in-game menu** to get them to work together. If you're having issues with CFPAO and have this mod installed, try checking if you have that fix enabled or not.
  
  
[Skill Based Dynamic Animations:](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99842?tab=files) This mod will overwrite my magic animations, reverting them to the vanilla ones (presumably at lower magicka/skill levels, haven't tested it myself).
  
  
[Archery Gameplay Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24296?tab=description): Most of it should be compatible. The only possible issue is that since AGO doesn't use DAR or OAR, all of my bow animations will replace the first person ones from AGO, which means you won't get things like the arrow stab or pre-nocked arrows. If that's fine with you, then great, but if not, I'd recommend just disabling my bow animations in CPFAO's installer so you can get everything else you want from CFPAO while still keeping all the functionality and animations from AGO.
  
  
[Weapon Styles - Draw-Sheathe animations for IED](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85085): This mod uses some of my animations. I don't actually know what the mod does because I was too lazy to read the description, honestly. But if you're experiencing trouble with the dual swords still using my equip/unequip animations even after you disabled them in the installer, check if you have this mod in your load order. Also, if you're having trouble with the bound sword awkwardly lowering and suddenly vanishing when you sheathe it, that seems to be caused by this mod as well.
  
  
[OARganic Skill Based Animations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/141082): If you're experiencing issues with the movement animations not playing at all, see if you've got this in your load order and try disabling it.
  
  
**Mods that put your shield on the back:** Those kinds of mods only work in third person, and as far as I know there's no way of replicating it in first person. I'd recommend just disabling all the movement options if it bothers you.
  
  
**Vortex mod manager:** Use of this mod manager seems to break the mod during installation for some people, resulting in things like missing data or simply no animations in game. Apparently this is a **rare issue** that can happen with any mod, so take this with a grain of salt.
  
  
**Mod Organizer mod manager:** Apparently using this mod manager can break the animations for some people, resulting in them being invisible or at the player's feet. I'm unsure what exactly triggers this to break, as I use Mod Organizer 2 with no issues. If you have a similar issue, I'd recommend **trying everything else first**, but if all else fails try **installing the mod manually** (explained above).

[Precision - Accurate Melee Collisions by Ersh:](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72347)﻿﻿ This mod will improve both first and third person combat, making it so your weapon actually has to hit your opponent rather than an arbitrary time marker being reached. I've been told that this mod works fine without it, though. So it's up to you!
  
  
[Valhalla Combat by dTry:](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64741)﻿ This mod will spice up your combat experience on a mechanical level, adding things like stun and executions, projectile parrying, timed blocking, and fun stamina management. Even if you don't download my mod, this one is worth getting.
  
  
[Verolevi's third person animation mods:](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3812151?tab=user+files) These animations are always a must-have in any of my load orders and will overhaul basically all of your third person animations. They're really, really, talented and well-done. Another major inspiration.﻿﻿﻿
  
  
[Finally First Person Magic Animation for SSE by 5poiler:](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20375)﻿ This mod is obviously not compatible with the full package, but if you want to use these animations with my mod, disable CFPAO's magic animations in OAR's in-game menu.﻿
  
  
[Also check out ShoryukenBruh's mod:](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45177)﻿ My mod comes with plenty of options in OAR's in-game menu, so if you want to mix and match mine with his, you can disable the weapons you don't want in mine and enable them in his!
  
**![](https://i.imgur.com/aiqjwSw.png)﻿﻿**These are listed in no particular order. Please don't take this list to mean these things are guaranteed, as I have always had trouble committing to things and it's a miracle I've even gotten this far.
  
  

  
* **General bug fixes and tweaks:** Always high on the list.
**General improvement and refinement:** 1.5 cleaned things up a bit, but there's always room for improvement.
  
* **Sneak animations:** I finally figured out what was causing these to break, so expect sneak animations in the future!
**Magical staves:** Things I missed the first time around.
  
* **Racial animation sets:** What this means is that each race would have its own unique animation set, separate from the default one. So, for example, a Khajiit would wield a sword differently than a Nord would, and so on and so forth.
**Unique weapon animation sets:** Any unique, named weapon would get its own, unique animations. For example, someone wielding the Dawnbreaker sword would wield it much differently than a regular sword, or the Mace of Molag Bal differently than a regular mace. Will NOT extend to mod-added weapons.

You control the whims of powerful beings and force those who have already made the ultimate sacrifice to give a little bit more. Bring forth your power, mage."
