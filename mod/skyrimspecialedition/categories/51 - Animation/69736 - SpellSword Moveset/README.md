The Spellsword moveset has been completely overhauled.
  
  
  
The idle and movement animations, as well as the sprint animation, were all reworked to have the same movement.
  
  
  
I was able to create more transition animations using [Open Animation Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92109).
  
  
  
  
This mod does not require **FNIS** or **Nemesis**.
  
  
Instead you need [Dynamic Animation Casting](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73293) and [Behavior Data Injector](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78146).
  
  
Installation is simple because it is a SKSE plugin mod.
  
  
  
  
The dash-sprint transition feature included in the video will be supported when the dynamic sprint mode I'm making is released.
