Hey there! Ever thought about injecting some Street Fighter energy into Skyrim?
  
  
... Me neither.
  
  
But the vanilla unarmed idling animation never quite looked natural to me - so, I've created a replacement for it and even crafted some transitions to match.
  
  
Here it is:

And here's a side-by-side comparison with the vanilla animation, kindly provided by Lydia:

I don't use any replacers for the actual punching animations, so it was made with the vanilla ones in mind.
  
  
I've uploaded two versions as usual:
  

  
* **Female player character only** (the one I'm using)
A version without conditions, **so every NPC and player can use it**.
  

**Choose one** depending on your animation variety preferences.
  
  
In OAR, the priority is set to 5201. Keep this in mind if you have other animation replacers for that type.
  
  
That's about it. Have fun.
