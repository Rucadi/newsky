I've always stuck to vanilla movement, even with the many options out there. I just like how it looks.
  
After delving into making some run/walk anims for another project (hehe) I noticed little things in vanilla that I can't unsee.
  
  
This mod edits the vanilla run & walk animations, fixing broken loops, jittery limbs, 'clicking' motions, etc.
  
It also stylizes a bit, smoothing out arcs and changing posture. Animations are more casual looking. Run has a slight bounce.
  
  
Covers all 8 directions, walk, run, sprint, male & female.

**Installation:**
  
Please use a mod manager.
  
Safe to uninstall mid-game.
  
  
**Requirements:**
  
None.
  
  
**Recommended Mods:**
  
[True Directional Movement](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51614)﻿ - 360° movement & procedural leaning
  
[SmoothCam](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41252)﻿ - prevents any camera location/fov snapping
  
  
**Compatibility:**
  
This is just an animation replacer like other mods.
  
Feel free to use this as a 'base' mod and have other animation sets overwrite this one, based on your preference.
  
Many animation sets do not cover the 6 backward animations. (do any?)
  
  
**useless animation info, what i changed if you care, FAQ:**
  
Spoiler[left]
  
goals:
  
  
- fix broken things
  
- make it look the way i want lol
  
- look casual, calm and less intentionally 'pretty' or 'intimidating'
  
- but still vanilla-ish! still can be interpreted as above! but it's less in your face
  
- should look better on a variety of character types
  
- as in large/thin/timid/buff, etc
  
  
actual run changes:
  
  
- jittery, freezing legs > smooth arc
  
- upper body 'clicks' > softened
  
- most arm movement in forearms > more whole arm movement, less elbow arc
  
- added slight vertical bounce (insp. from SFRA :)))
  
- reduced stomach mesh stretching
  
- straighter posture
  
- less chicken dance looking
  
- broken fingers fixed???
  
  
walk:
  
  
- smoother elbow bending
  
- broken diagonal walk loop fixed (wtf bethesda)
  
- more casual posture/angles
  
- reduced joint snapping when foot makes contact with ground
  
- clavicles move less
  
- improved possible skirt clipping
  
  
sprint:
  
- broken fingers again
  
- female sprint has this odd right hand wave, fixed
  
  
technical details that some other movement mods leave out >:(
  
  
- skirt bone animations are intact
  
- as close as i can get to seamless looping (obviously)
  
- footstep sounds intact
