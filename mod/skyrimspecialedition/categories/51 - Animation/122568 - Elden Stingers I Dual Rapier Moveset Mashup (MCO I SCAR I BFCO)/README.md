[font=Tahoma][Elden Rim's](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/110667)﻿ dual Rapier animation is very short, containing only 3 normal attacks and 1 power attack.
  
What I did was simply mix and re-annotate this animation with some others from the same collection, to make it a little longer and more fun to use.
  
*Now there are 4 normal attacks and 4 power attacks,* ***all chainable.***
  
  
I also patched it to **SCAR**, so you can give your follower two rapiers if you want him to go around drilling things.[/font][font=Trebuchet MS]
