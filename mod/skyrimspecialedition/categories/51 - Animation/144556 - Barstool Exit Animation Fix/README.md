? Finally — A Proper Barstool Exit Animation! ?**
  
Ever noticed how weird it looks when your Dragonborn gets up from a barstool… backward?
  
That’s because in vanilla Skyrim, Bethesda mistakenly assigned the wrong exit animation — the one meant for bench seating — to barstools.
  
This leads to your character’s backside awkwardly clipping through the stool as they shuffle backward like they’re leaving a dining table.
  
**What This Mod Does:**
  
✔️ Fixes the exit animation for barstools so your character stands up FORWARD like a normal person.
  
✔️ Uses the PROPER animation Bethesda made but never finished — and now it works perfectly.
  
✔️ Works for both male and female characters, player and NPCs.
  
✔️ No weird butt-clipping through the stool anymore.
  
✔️ **No extra SKSE mods needed!** Just one quick fix at the root of the problem.
  
  
**Compatibility and Recommended Mods:**
  
✔️ Works with any mod loadout — this is a behavior-level fix, not a mesh or skeleton replacement.
  
✔️ If you prefer a more feminine animation for females, it's also fully compatible with *[Improved Barstool Exit Animation](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/143012), thanks to SonderBain*
