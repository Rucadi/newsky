# Goetia Animations - Female Idle Walk And Run
- Author: Verolevi
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

This marks the start of my 3rd animation series "Goetia", which revolves around magic users and aims to convey, through animations, a darker yet confident character personality (plus a bit of swag).
  
[size=3] If you're looking for different moods, check out the counterpart of this mod from my  previous series "Vanargand" and "Leviathan", which I'll hopefully be updating/remaking sometime in the future as I've learned quite a bit since I made them with regards to animating, thanks to the constructive and positive side of this community.
  
  
This can be installed either as a simple replacer or as a "Conditional Armor Type Animations" addon which can be used alongside other CATA addons to change the actors' animations depending on their armor type and, in the case of Goetia, their mage criteria:
  
  
If using the CATA Addon version of this mod, the characters (PC and NPCs) will use these animations when non-armored, wearing clothing equipment, has a magicka pool of at least 300 (items/buffs apply) or is at least level 65 in any of the 5 major magic schools (can be changed from "\_conditions.txt").

This mod contains the following female animations:
  

  
* 30 seconds long idle that cycles between different poses.
Two-cycle forward and side directions for walk.
  
* Two-cycle forward and side directions for run.
