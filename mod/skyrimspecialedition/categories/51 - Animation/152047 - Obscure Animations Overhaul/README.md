# Obscure Animations Overhaul

Always felt like, amongst all the things that haven't aged well since the release of Skyrim, it's animations are some of the worst offenders. And what good are all the fancy shaders and textures if all the characters look good, but still move like wooden dolls?
  
  
Thankfully, talented people made [many](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/103288) [fantastic](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85073) [idles](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27526?tab=description), [movement](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/126100), [conditional](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/132028) [animations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34006), remade [dialogues](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63471) and [gestures](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64420), almost [every](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/KyrgyzGuitarist/mods?gameId=1704) [animator](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Verolevi/mods?gameId=1704) [out there](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/black364/mods?gameId=1704) and their [dogs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/132871) made fighting animations to replace the old ones.
  
  
But still, a few animations of various degree of obscurity remained, that I couldn't find any replacements for - so I went out and made them myself.

Vanilla idles are on the right side, edited ones are on the left.

...because every time Hadvar points to the mountain in the intro, or Aurien does a LotD museum tour, my eyes hurt.

Now with a bit more sarcasm, and no longer looking like it was ported straight from GTA 3.

No one can convince me the original lockpicking animation didn’t originate as “character typing on a futuristic computer in an early 2000s video game.” ?

Fixed timing and certain visual glitches.

I point in your general direction.

I couldn't shake off the hilarious feeling that the original looked more like a dance than anything, and I couldn't bring myself to fully change it to something more name appropriate. Just fixed the technical stuff and the stiff joints, and gave some life to the fingers.

I've tried to keep it somewhat close to the original logic for each animation - but slowed down some of them, so they don't look **so** aggressive.
  
*Note: if you've got [Conditional Tavern Cheering](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63029?tab=description), it will play it's animations over a couple of these, so adjust its OAR's config accordingly.*

It will look a touch different in-game from how it does in the animation program, due to Havok's ragdolls being weird - but hopefully it'll look less janky than the original was.*Same speed as the original animation, if you're looking for something quicker - take a look at [Super Fast Get Up](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46714?tab=description).*
  
  
I hope for this to be an ongoing project - at least, until I stop randomly stumbling upon animations that make me cry tears of blood. 
  
So maybe expect some updates in the future. ^\_^
  
  
**Installation**
  
Just a simple hkx replacer. No additional requirements. Install/uninstall at will.
