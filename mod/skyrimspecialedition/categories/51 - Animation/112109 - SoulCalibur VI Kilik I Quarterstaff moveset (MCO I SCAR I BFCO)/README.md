[font=Verdana]**SC6 - KILIK**[/font][font=Verdana]**QUARTERSTAFF MOVESET (MCO - SCAR)**[/font][font=Verdana]
  
  
With **LilBadJj's permission**, I converted and re-annotated his SkySA battlestaff moveset to **MCO** and **SCAR**.
  
Can be used by **player and NPCs**, as long as they are equipped with a **quarterstaff**.
  
  
***NPCs won't use the last power attack (the one that the character goes up on the quarterstaff) because I thought it was too flashy for them.***
  
  
  
  
[font=Verdana]*Credits to [LilBadJj](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/72634963)﻿﻿for the excellent animation and [Shepiao](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/95962183) ﻿for the screenshots that I 'politely' stole to make the thumbnail xD

[/font][font=Lucida Sans Unicode]**[i]There are dozens of other great SkySA animations that can be reused like this.
  
I will seek permission from other creators to prevent such animations from being lost in time.***[/font][/i][/font][/font]
