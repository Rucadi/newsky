This mod adds some new attack animations for trolls.
  
These attacks don't overwrite original attacks.
  
Vanilla troll attacks are a little boring, because the combos are too similar. I didn't realize vanilla troll has four kinds of combo attacks until I extract Skyrim animation file.
  
So I add some new kinds of attack animations. As suggested, I add drop kick, in optional files.
  
  
REQUIREMENTS:
  
DYNAMIC ANIMATION REPLACER
  
ANIMATION MOTION REVOLUTION
