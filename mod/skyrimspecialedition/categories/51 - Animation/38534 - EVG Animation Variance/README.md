Adds variety in currently existing animations based on NPC personality types, conditions, or just randomly, to make Skyrim feel a bit more diverse.
  
Some animations are done from scratch by hand, others as minor adjustments to the vanilla animations.

**Recommended:** 
  
[NPC Animation Remix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63471)﻿
  
Gives NPCs many randomized idling animations & more.
  
I recommend going through that author's account for other similar mods as well.
  
  
[AI Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21654) ﻿
  
Makes NPCs use unused vanilla animations in their schedules.
  
  
**Requires:**
  
[Dynamic Animation Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33746)
  
(And it's [requirements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444).)
  
Please endorse these mods, this wouldn't have been possible without them.
  
  
**Installation:**
  
Please use a mod manager.
  
You can uninstall safely at any time, no scripts or savegame changes are in the mod.
  
  
All modules are optional and somewhat customizable through a FOMOD installation.
  
If you only want the torch animations, or just the player idles, you can do that.
  
  
**FAQ/Compatibility:**
  
Spoiler
  
[left]Compatibility
  
[spoiler]
  
General: DAR priority values are set extremely low to allow other mods to have priority over this one.
  
  
Nemesis/FNIS/CGO/AGO/Other Animation Replacers & Systems: Yes(?)
  
  
PCEA: Idles in PCEA will always have priority over mine. Remove any idles if you want the repurposed ones to work.
  
  
Random Idles/Sexy Move: Will have priority over this mod.
  
  
EVG Conditional Idles: are you serious
  
  
cookeh's conditional and random idles: Yes.
  
  
Torch Module:
  
Compatible with new torch types (Everlight) and torch replacers (Medieval Torches.) Proper torch wield will look funny with Tilted away, but is still compatible.
  
  
Custom Racial Animation Path: The priority numbers for that mod were set very high, will need personal tweaking based on your DAR mods. hehe C.R.A.P
  
  
FAQ
  
Spoiler
  
Why is this not a part of Conditional Idles?
  
I don't know. This is more about spicing up vanilla, making it not look so samey- think of it like trying to make a badly tiled texture look better. There's potential, you just need to tweak it a little. Conditional Idles is more like adding new things or new animations to explore, also uses other mods as hooks to add content. This is staying vanilla. probably.

There is no transition animation for this (yet) so it might be a bit snappy or odd looking when it begins. Because of that, this one is disabled by default. Use the modular installation option to activate it.

**Future plans:**
  
More personality
  
Tweaks to egoistic/young female (discovered some more animation tools, more potential)
  
  
**Elder Animations:**
  
Spoiler
  
  
[left]Elder animations have been moved to the optional section of the FOMOD, it no longer comes with the 'full installation' option.
  
  
There's obviously a problem with crashes there, but in terms of fixing it:
  
  
1. 99% of the animations were made the same way with the same program, but it's apparently just elder stuff breaking..?
  
2. i don't get animation related crashes on my set ups (on my personal load order & when I recorded for hours on MXR's) so i can't even test for it
  
3. there's no obvious indicator for what animation out of the 40 there cause said crash
  
  
therefore testing for CTDs would be out of my hands and also incredibly tedious :< sorry LOL
  
unless there's a way to diagnose what the exact issue is, remaking them again and hoping for it to work would probably be the best course of action hhhhhhhh[/left]
