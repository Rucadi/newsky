**How to use**

![](https://i.imgur.com/5AdINYE.png)﻿
  
*This is the OA3PP logo in OStim navigation*

  

  
* *Open Animations 3P Plus* is accessed through **any OStim starting idle animation** for **one male** and **two female characters**. Therefore, you must start an OStim scene between one male and two female characters.
I recommend that you install a gameplay mod that allows 3P or 4P scene starting, such as [OStim Romance](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/107671) for vanilla NPCs and [Love Story Romance Subjects](https://discord.gg/ostim)﻿ for new voiced NPCs;
  
* Many animations are made with support for first person view. To see them in first person, get [Improved Camera](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93962) and the OARE configuration from the [OARE mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98732/?tab=files). *Notice: the OARE file is **different** from the OStim configuration file. I made both files, but the latter is outdated and I cannot update it.*

  
  
**Content & Previews**
  

  
* Depictions of love between one male and two females.
Featuring hand-crafted and immersive **icons**!
  

  
The following are animation branches that include **neutral**, **caressing**and **erotic** animations.
  
Use the **OStim navigation menu** to browse through them.
  

  
* 3P Standing Apart;
3P Male Standing Females Kneeling;
  
* 3P Sitting;
3P Sitting Holding;
  
* 3P Lying;
3P Spread Legs,
  
* 3P Bent Over;
3P Atop Each Other;
  
* 4P Standing.

**Notice:**OStim, as open software, is not proprietary like Skyrim is to Bethesda, and there can be no official content for it.
