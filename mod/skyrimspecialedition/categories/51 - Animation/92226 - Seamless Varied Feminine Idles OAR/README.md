Spoiler"Ershin was actually kind enough to add this feature per my request
  
Thank you again Ershin!
  
  
For this reason, this series will officially only support OAR
  
---
  
**anim snapping** is a new issue with loop swapping's lack of **anim blend,**
  
causing **transitions** to **jerk** if misaligned with the next idle
  
  
In my mod a **core pose** is used to prevent **anim snapping**
  
Allowing the animations to act together as if pieces to a puzzle"
  
"[Open Animation Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92109)﻿ adds new possibilities and with it new challenges
  
**Looping Animations** like Idles can now be **swapped** at rest without player input
  
This was previously **impossible** with **DAR** and idles became boring unless
  
animations were needlessly long to add more variation......."[/font]*

![](https://i.imgur.com/w9e5B78.png)SpoilerQ: **DAR support?**
  
A: OAR supports all existing DAR mods
  
It is also far more user and mod developer friendly
  
While I still might make a few DAR mods
  
I will not restrict myself to it since OAR
  
Is all I have ever hoped for

Q: **Male anims when???**
  
A: If I one day feel like it

Q: **What are those outfits your characters are wearing?**
  
A: Here are some screenshots of my inventory for several outfits :)
  
I wish I could help more but I have over a 1000 mods in my modlist
  
and would rather not cipher through them all

**Thanks to Kars for the original Blender Rig used in these animations creation**
  
  
Permission to edit/release/update/distribute these files in part noncommercially **only on nexusmods**
  
as long as you credit me as the original creator! This is **not a greenlight** to reupload my work in part or whole
  
as separate animation packs; **however**, most things are fine, as long as they still require my original mod.
  
Please **consult me** if you are interested in porting to Skyrim LE or Console
  
  
If you are interested in including these animations in your own mod packs
  
Misc files **Animation Resources OAR** can be added as a requirement to your pack
  
This allows for a nondestructive method of adding new configs to my animations
