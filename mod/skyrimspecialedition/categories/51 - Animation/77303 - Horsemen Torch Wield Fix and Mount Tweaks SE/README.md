BRIEFING:
  

  
* Some mechanics on horseback that Bethesda never constructed into the Vanilla Horse Behavior Graph
This mod is a direct, cure the root-cause approach rather then a treat the symptoms workaround
  
* Also remedies some micro-exploits in horse jumping behavior construct but so fine, they would go unnoticed in-game

* [Nemesis Unlimited Behavior Engine](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60033) "OR" [Pandora Behavior Engine Plus](https://github.com/Monitor144hz/Pandora-Behaviour-Engine-Plus/releases/latest)﻿﻿﻿﻿
Know how to use it correctly
  

  
INSTALLATION
  

  
* Safe to Install any time. No Plugin
Install with your Mod Manager *(please don't ask for help if not using one)*
  
* Turn on mod in manager and launch Nemesis or Pandora
Activate the mod within the Engine
  
* Run Engine (may need to update the Nemesis Engine prior)
Make sure engine generated output is triumphant conflict winner
  

  
UPDATING THE FOOLPROOF WAY
  

  
* Download mod update package
Install with your Mod Manager. Replace prev. build entirely and enable
  
* Delete the last engine run generated Meshes and Scripts output folders
Delete step above could be subjective per user depending if current output has any special files. Preserve those if required
  
If you just use Nemesis or Pandora the general way making usual batch runs, I would not concern over the yellow check step
  
Would be a wise to make a Manager rule forcing Engine to generate its output in its own dedicated "Engine Output" mod* Run Engine creating new generated output
Make sure engine generated output is triumphant conflict winner
  

  
UNINSTALLATION
  

  
* Safe to uninstall any time. No Plugin
Remove the Mod
  
* Delete the last Engine run generated Meshes and Scripts output folders
Re-run Engine without the mod installed
  

  
COMPATIBILITY NOTES
  
COMPATIBLE - YES
  

  
* Should work with everything **unless** a third-party mod directly modifies file:
    
  "Data\Skyrim - Animations.bsa\Meshes\Actors\Character\Behaviors\HorseBehavior.hkx" in its own way
If another mod edits the HorseBehavior file but is a Nemesis/Pandora required mod, the Engine *should* merge the edits from both files into one output file. Rare case of critical conflict is if each mods HorseBehavior edits modify the exact same data within the HKX
  

COMPATIBLE - NO
  

* [Fores New Idles in Skyrim SE - FNIS SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3038) as substitution for Nemesis or Pandora:
    
  [list]
FNIS is **not** compatible
  
* It cannot be used in the same way to add behavior edits. Nothing we can do about it. Tis the nature of the beast
If things change, it will be accommodated but Fore is retired. The framework is no longer upkept nor open source
  
* This topic was re-visited after this post [HERE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/113480/?tab=posts#comment-116589538)﻿﻿ and remains unchanged. Bit more on it in spoiler belowSpoiler![](https://i.imgur.com/IFH82RF.jpg)
One of many more reasons, *others to come* why upgrading to a maintained behavior engine is not such a bad idea
