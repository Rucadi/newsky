What is this mod?

  
An SKSE plugin that dynamically removes the "opposite gender anims" flag from all actors. This flag causes actors to use the animations of the opposite gender (it is mainly used to make female actors use the male animations).
  
This is for example used on Lydia, Mjoll, Uthgerd and all female orcs in the game.
  
A lot of people don't like that since the male animation doesn't look good on the female body. That's what this mod is for.
  
  

Why this mod?

  
There are other mods that do similar things, but they either do it with an .esp, which modifies all affected actors and therefore is incompatible with replacers for said actors or with a synthesis patcher that is required to be run everytime you install/uninstall a replacer or custom NPC. This mod is a one time install that you never have to worry about again and is compatible with any replacer and custom NPC.
