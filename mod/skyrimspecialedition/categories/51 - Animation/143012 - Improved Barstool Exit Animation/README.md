This mod includes a new **Barstool Exit Transition**
  
For whatever reason **Bethesda** just forgot to add it \*shrug\*
  
a broken idle existed in the files but they never finished it
  
 They chose to put the **table bench** exit **anim** in its place
  
It took a **decade** but at least its **fixed** now lol
  
  
Uses **OAR** and **SDKR** to replace Barstools Animation
  
Intended as a **Unisex** Fix

Spoiler"It seems some people wanted there to be drama between us
  
funny thing is their mod does what I wished I could have done originally.
  
I don't see a need for drama when we both just want to fix the game.
  
That aside, I would now like to encourage you to use both mods together!
  
His mod restores vanilla functionality and mine effectively gives you a new animation.
  
His mod benefits mine when used together so why now use both!"

A: If the anims don't look good in your game
  
then you should probably just download the requirements
