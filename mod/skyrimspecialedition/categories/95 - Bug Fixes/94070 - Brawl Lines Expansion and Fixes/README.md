-Brawl Lines Expansion and Fixes -

  
This mod has two functions: it fixes some brawl lines behaviors that didn't make a whole lot of sense and it also expands the repertoire of lines NPCs can say while you're in the middle of a brawl.
  
  
  
  
*New Lines*
  

  
* **Added a dozen or so new lines to bystanders observing the brawl. They are straight from vanilla lines for the most part.**
    
  *"I love a good fight!"
    
  " Good fight going on here!"
    
  "Ooh, now that must have hurt!"
    
  "Damn, another fight!"
    
  "Keep your guard up! Use that opening!"
    
  "Twelve septims on the girl! Look at that speed!"
    
  "Who's winning?!"
    
  "Nice! Come on!"
    
  + others.*

  

**Video Showcase (2 minutes)**

  
*Fixes and changes to bystanders observing the fight:*
  

  
* **Some bystanders will now use cheer animations during the brawl. Better than standing like O\_O**

  
* **Gets rid of lines that were not too fitting for people observing the fight.**

 ﻿ ﻿"Don't hurt me, you win!" -> "Damn, another fight!"
  
 ﻿ ﻿ ﻿"Please, someone do something!" -> "Good fight going on here!"
  
 ﻿ ﻿"Somebody help!" -> "I love a good fight!"
  
  

  
* **Adds a timer to the vanilla lines, so they don't repeat one after another:**

 ﻿ ﻿"Drive that snowback to the ground! ... Drive that snowback to the ground!"
  
  

  
* **Lines now stop after your opponent is down.**

 ﻿﻿"Twelve septims on the big one!" (When the fight is already over and your enemy is already down)
  
  
\_\_
  
  
*Fixes for your combat target*
  

  
* **Removes incorrect victory lines when the NPC wins.**
    
   ﻿﻿﻿"No one here now..." -> "Not so tough now, are you?"

  
* **Removes incorrect combat lines when combat starts.**
    
   ﻿"I knew I'd find you!." -> "I'll try and make this quick!

  

  
* **Limits "extreme" lines not fitting a non-lethal fist fight.**
    
   ﻿ ﻿﻿﻿﻿"You won't leave Skyrim alive!" -> "Come on! I've fought worse than you!

**- ESL flagged?**Yes, like all my other mods.
  
  
**- Compatibility?**Nothing to worry about. The mod does add new conditions to a couple of vanilla taunts/flee lines to filter them out during the brawls, but I've forwarded the conditions of the most popular mods that change their conditions (Hunters not Bandits, RDO, USSEP...) So yeah, compatibility shouldn't be an issue.
  
  
**- "I've never experienced these dialogue bugs, how comes?"**It seems they are more apparent by using certain mods. There's also a random factor to them. In any case, this mod comes bundled with both the fixes and the new dialogue, so there should be something for everyone.
  
  
**- Does this replace "Modern Brawl Bug Fix" or similar?**No, my mod is only dealing with dialogue changes. So this mod is compatible with those mods.
  
  
**- "After I installed this mod, the brawling is no longer working or is giving me issues!"**Not possible. This mod is only dealing with dialogue changes. It does not edit the quest at all. Your problem is elsewhere.
  
  
**- "Why would you limit some of the banter? I loved when my brawling partner would say things like "I'll have your head on a pike!"**Listen, I love me some brawling banter, but it was often a bit out of place for a friendly fist fight. The objective is to knock your enemy out, not to behead them and put their heads on a pike. I know it's all happening in the heat of a fight and all, so the banter is still there, but non fitting lines are mostly filtered out.
  
  
**- "I like this mod. Can you recommend me similar ones?"**Check out "[Hunters not Bandits](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1547)", check out my other "[Lines Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/users/5201727?tab=user+files&BH=0)" mods, check out [Fists of Fury](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73835) if you want more brawls.
  
  
**- "Is your next mod a see-through underwear armor that moves?"**Probably not... but one should never give up on hope!
