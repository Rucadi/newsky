Were you disappointed when you killed the new Ayleid Lich added by the Anniversary Edition Creation Club release The Cause,
  
 and found that the quite nice unique crown he was wearing throughout the fight disintegrated along with his corpse?
  
  
Well guess what it was supposed to be, if you look through the files you will find that the crown is in the files but is lacking a model and unobtainable.
  
  
This mod fixes that, it extracts the crown from the corpse and adapts it so there is a wearable version 
  
 for all the humanoid and beast races, and has model with collision if dropped.
  
  
It also makes the Lich drop it upon death, all you need to do is loot the crown from its ashes.
  
  
  
  
  
  
Thanks to Jelidity for her help and fixes,
  
as well as the texture colour adjustments to
  
 make the crown more accurately match the staff

**Requirements**
  
  
This mod requires **Anniversary Edition**
  
or more accurately **The Cause**
  
but if you want more than one thing it will work
  
out much cheaper to just buy **Anniversary Edition** as a whole
  
its pretty good value
