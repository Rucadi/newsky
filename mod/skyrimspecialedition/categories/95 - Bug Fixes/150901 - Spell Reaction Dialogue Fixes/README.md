# Spell Reaction Dialogue Fixes
- Author: Professional Dragonslayer
- Game: skyrimspecialedition

**Summary**
  
  
Skyrim NPCs have [reaction dialogue](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Generic_Dialogue#Reactions_to_non-hostile_spells) to several non-damage spells being cast upon them. This feature seems to be little noticed that there are several bugs with this this that went unfixed thus far (including by USSEP). For example, calm was pointing to the weird spell dialogue topic even in combat and courage doesn't play the lines in combat, when that's the time where casting courage makes the most sense.
  
  
**Installation**
  
  
Simply download and install with the mod manager of your choice (Recommended) or manually extract to your data folder.
  
**Compatibility**
  
  
Compatible with everything that doesn't edit the affected magic effects, mods that edit spells with those effects are fine.
  
  
**Permissions**
  
  
As this is a very small bugfix mod, you can do what ever you want with it. Credit would be nice but feel free to reupload, change or incorporate my mod however you may see fit.
  
  
**Thanks**
