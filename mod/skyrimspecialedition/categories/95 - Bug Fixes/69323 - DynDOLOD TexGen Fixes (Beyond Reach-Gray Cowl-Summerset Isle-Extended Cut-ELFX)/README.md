Cheesy Intro:Spoiler﻿ Are you like me?
  
Annoyed by having to go through each and every individual mod on your modlist?
  
Would you rather somebody else do the work for you?
  
  
Well here I am!
  
I have decided to make a patch collection of some of the extra fixes from mods
  
which either may not be updated, or may have already had these issues brought up.
  
So I'm here to make your guys lives easier!
  
For Mod Authors & specifics around this mod:SpoilerSo, most of the problems listed above are related to missing normals. If you don't have normals for textures and want some, use [NormalMap-Online](https://cpetry.github.io/NormalMap-Online/). Just discovered it.
  
  
This mod is mostly just a bunch of "bootleg" fixes. Mod authors are the ones who know their own mod better than I would, so really, they should fix their own errors themselves. DynDOLOD is purely picking up things mod authors have missed. Put your own mods through DynDOLOD and find out how to fix them yourselves. Some of these fixes are quite well done, but most as I say are bootleggy. However, it's generally considered better to have his mod than not.
