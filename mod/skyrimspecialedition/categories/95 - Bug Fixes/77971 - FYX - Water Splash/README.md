I've seen this disgusting bug several times, with all the mods that fix things and after some searching I haven't found anything that fixes it.
  
These are meshes used everywhere in Skyrim where there are waterfalls, among others.
  
Difficult to show you really with screenshots, it's even more disgusting in game.
  
If you've never seen these seams in the water before, now you'll see them all the time. :p
  
  
- Fix the UV seams on 5 meshes
  
- Version for [RWT2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2182)
  
- Combined version for [RWT2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2182) x [Water Effects Brightness and Reflection Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63862) x [Water Effects Brightness and Reflection Fix - Realistic Water Two Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64736)
  
- Version for [Water for ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37061)
  
- Combined version [Water for ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37061) x [Water Effects Brightness and Reflection Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63862)
  
- Vanilla users version
  
  
Safe install/uninstall anytime.
  
  
Enjoy !
  
  
  
  
In all these mods, the 5 meshes are vanilla versions with modifications in Nifskope, I simply did the same here to make them compatible for each of the conflicting mods in addition to fix the seams.
  
Don't forget to Endorse each mod credited if you haven't already done so.
