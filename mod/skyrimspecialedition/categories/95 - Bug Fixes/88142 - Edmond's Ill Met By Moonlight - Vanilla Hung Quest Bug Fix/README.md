Ill Met By Moonight
  
-Vanilla Hung Quest Bug Fix-

  
  
Description
  
Alright this is my 3rd freaking mod page I had to create tonight so listen up buttercup i'm keeping this short. The vanilla quest gets hung because the STUPID NPC Sinding wont walk up to the bars of his jail cell in Falkreath. You can fix this by leaving the jail and going back in multiple times and eventually the quest will trigger. This bug is documented in the wiki and well known you got a 50/50 shot of getting it unless your freaken me then you have 100000% chance of getting it. I fixed this stupid bug.
  
  
Also Moonlight tales also has a bug with the quest that makes it get hung because the STUPID NPC misses a script action due to extended animation sequences from  the Moonlight tales mod permanently breaking the quest. This fixes that as well and if you don't use Moonlight tales no problem just install the other stupid file that fixes the stupid vanilla problem.
