# Myrwatch - Editable Home Cells (Cell Bug Workaround)

**With version 7.0.14 and up, [SSE Engine Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17230)﻿ provides a true fix for this bug, allowing all edits to the original cells. Since mods made that way are fundamentally incompatible with anything made with this worse duplicate cell solution, this mod should be considered obsolete and, following updates to dependent mods, will be hidden. Please DO NOT create any more mods based on this file.
  
  
Old description while still active:
  
  
What does this mod do?**
  
  
This mod is a supplementary master file (ESM) that copies the Myrwatch interior and makes it usable to mod authors. All relevant
  
references have been updated and the quest fully playtested to ensure it functions correctly and will provide a stable platform to build off of.
  
  
Without this implementation, a mod editing Myrwatch's new cells will cause that cell to break due to the creation being an ESM flagged ESL.
  
  
Effectively, this ESM is a platform for people to make house overhauls.
  
  

**Compatibility**

  
**﻿**
  
This mod should be compatible with anything that edits Myrwatch unless it edits the existing cells (somehow), in which case the change would need to be redone in the new cells. A USCCCP patch has been provided to forward the activator changes it makes.
  
  
No edits have been made to any statics or furniture themselves, so visual/functional overhauls are 100% compatible.
