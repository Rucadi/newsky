This is a fix to prevent the need to re-equip slot 32, the torso, or other slots such as the hands because the animation bones have become locked. It also allows cbpc and smp to better co-exist in mixed environments because when smp locks up the bones, they are locked up for cbpc as well. There are multiple versions, they all require avx and there is no cuda support.
