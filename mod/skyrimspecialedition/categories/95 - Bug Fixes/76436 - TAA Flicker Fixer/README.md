[font=Verdana]**What this mod does**[/font]
  
This fixes a very annoying issue when you use TAA. The foliage begins to flicker every time you move the mouse. Depending on what mods you use for grass, trees and bushes, the issue is less visible. For me it was now very visible at night and very annoying. If you ever noticed this issue, you know what I'm talking about. If you haven't noticed that until now, I'm sorry.
  
  
I added one example of that flickering. It's hard to capture for a demonstration. In the not adjusted image, you can see that every time the mouse is moved, a slight flicker appears and the space between the leaves get brighter. This can be better seen on the right sight of the image. The 4 trees between the street lamp and the poster. When you are ingame, the issue is much more visible.
  
  
  
**Install**This mod only changes some ini settings, which are connected to an ESP file flagged as ESL. So it's compatible with 99.9% of all mods, except for mods that do the same. **Choose only one Main file.**
  
  
  

**Without adjusted settings**(Yes, the images are from Fallout 4, but it's the same issue. They have the same TAA implemented)
