Properly Environment Mapped[/font]

  
Main Files:** Files considered as actual fixes rather than preferences
  
  
Dead Man's Dread
  
Meshes in Dead Man's Dread have shiny surfaces where there shouldn't be (noticeably Cyrus' Clothes) due to the lack of an environmental mask map. This mod basically adds mask maps to these meshes resulting in properly cubemapped meshes with shiny metal parts.
  
  
Dwarven Armored Mudcrab
  
The original Mudcrab mesh doesn't have \_m map which makes the shine inconsistent with other Dwarven items. This mod tweaks its diffuse map to be darker with baked ambient occlusion and recolor to be closer to aMidianborn Dwarven items (Although it still looks consistent with vanilla and other retextures) and added \_m map so the shine is correctly applied.
  
  
Iron Plate Armor
  
Weirdly enough, original meshes already have cubemap assigned to them without enabling them in the settings (Environment Map Scale set to 0). This mod just turns the scale to 1 and replaces ore\_iron\_e cubemap with shinydull\_e to be consistent with vanilla iron weapons.
  
  
Orcish Plate Armor
  
Similar to Iron Plate, the meshes already have cubemap assigned to them without enabling them in the settings. I edited them to have subtle reflections consistent with vanilla Orcish weapons.
  
  
**Optional Files:** My preference
  
  
Dwarven Mail - Texture Tweak
  
Tweaked diffuse maps of Dwarven Mail set to be slightly darker with baked in AO. Somewhat similar colors to Amidianborn Dwarven Armors.
  
  
Orcish Plate - Texture Tweak
  
Tweaked diffuse maps of Orcish Plate set to be darker similar to Amidianborn Orcish Armors. Can be used without the main file.
