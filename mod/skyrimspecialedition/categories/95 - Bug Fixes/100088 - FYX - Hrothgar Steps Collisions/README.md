Hi !
  
  
You must have already noticed this bug when you climbed the steps to High Hrothgar.
  
When you go up the steps sometimes you stay stuck for a tiny second (as if the game was freezing), and worse, sometimes you get stuck running in place... It's quite annoying given the number of steps to climb.
  
So this little FYX fixes that.
  
  
  
**In short**
  
  

  
* Reworked step collisions which fixes this annoying bug. (the player to get stuck when climbing the steps)
No ESP
  
* Safe to Intall/Uninstall anytimes

  
Enjoy !
