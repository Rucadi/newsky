﻿**Description**
  
This SKSE plugin fixes an engine issue of magic effects. If these trigger a stagger effect on the target, the target staggers in the wrong direction in relation to the caster actor. This is because the caster actor is not found as the stagger aggressor. As a result, the stagger direction can't be identified.
  
For example, if you shout "unrealting force" behind a character, you will now see the character stumble forwards instead of stumbling backwards as in Vanilla.
  
  
This plugin also fixes the issue that [Mod Target Stagger](https://ck.uesp.net/w/index.php?title=Perk_Entry_Point&mobileaction=toggle_view_desktop)﻿ does not affect the stagger magic magnitude in vanilla.
  
For example, [Paarthurnax](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Paarthurnax_(dragon))'s meditation ability "[Force Without Effort](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Unrelenting_Force)﻿"﻿ in vanilla does not strengthen the effort of [size=3]unrealting force.
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
Works on SE, AE and VR.
  
Incompatible with [Stagger Direction Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43339)/[Stagger Direction Fix - NG](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69291)﻿﻿. Both plugins do the same thing, this one just in a shorter and better way because it solves the problem directly at the fundamental cause.
