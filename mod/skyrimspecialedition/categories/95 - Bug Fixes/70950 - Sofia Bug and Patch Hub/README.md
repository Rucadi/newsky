Untested/Unresolved:
  
Spoiler**All "Pages" below refer to the bugs section in the orginal Sofia SE mod.
  
Document refers to Sofia Bugs Section - Document in the files section.
  
This also contains some extra notes on the bugs listed below & more.**
  
**CTD's:**[spoiler]CTD after paying priest - Need more info.
  
CTD removing items from storage - No fix atm.
  
CTD when casting Magelight - Page 5. Seems to mostly occur in Fellglow Keep.
  
CTD when given new armour - Read responses on page 12. Might be fixed there.
  
CTD when giving favorited items - Page 4.
  
CTD while drunk asking her to do something - Page 8. You can ask her to attack and all is well, but anything else = CTD.
  
CTD upon first conversation - Not sure.**Continuously, keeps on, doesn't** **stop****:**SpoilerContinuously claps while sober - Not sure if user just misread her body language. But no fix as of yet.
  
Eyes/pupils pointing up and right - Sounds like a facegen/facegeom issue. Try .esp replacer or Missing Texture/mesh fixes listed above.
  
Flying/floating up in the sky - No fix. Presumedly wayfinding problem.
  
Killing non-hostile NPCs - Page 3. You could try changing her from aggressive to unaggressive, but that may mess up her combat.
  
Sharing Too Much Gold - Look in document. Page 13. No resolve atm.
  
Too close/won't keep distance - No fix as of yet. Look at "Too close and pushy" on page 10.**Combat/equipment related:**SpoilerArmor loses enchantments - Page 5. You could try the normal option instead of set outfit option...
  
Head turns brown when changing combat style - No known fix as of yet. Page 1.
  
Mouth doesn't move when talking - Honestly, not sure. Could be something related to missing engine fix or animation fix mods.
  
Only casts same/repeating (low) level spells - No known fix.
  
Stuck in loop - No fix. Page 12 has a decent description.
  
Turned into a Vampire - Only 1 report on Page 1. Mentioned it could be related to [Sanguinaire](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26312) .
  
Wielding torch like a shield - Happens when she has torch & shield in inventory. No known fix yet. Page 6.
  
Won't attack - Needs more info.
  
Won't get off/dismount horse - No current known fix yet. Try using [Savage Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37768) as an alternative for animal behaviour.**Disappearing/invisible/missing:**SpoilerBuggy/glitchy body textures - You could try the .esp replacer I uploaded. Tell me if it helps and I can move this to Manual Fixes.
  
Can't find horse - No known fix yet. Page 3.
  
Clipping through/no body collision - I assume this is a mod list issue. But they didn't post theirs... I might've had this as well.
  
Head with no/missing body - Page 14. No fix afaik. Potentially reinstall using either loose or BSA.
  
Horrible/glitchy feet - Originally thought to be killable children, but currently unresolved. I suggest using UNP or some other skin replacer. Or the skin patch I have.
  
Missing Head & Voice - Unknown. Page 5.**Dialogue/Quest/MCM:**SpoilerApostraphes are boxes in subtitles - Page 13. This might be fixed with [Typo Grammar and Dialogue Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38952).
  
Broken intro dialogue (freeze at "How about you" part) - No fix that I'm aware. Check document for further info (Page 13).
  
Day counter stuck - No fix yet afaik. One user said Reset, wait 24 hours, and it went up. Tell me if this fixes it! And I'll add it to
  
Fixes.
  
Incorrect environmental dialogue - No known fix. Check out "Dialogue Problems" page 15.
  
Marriage quest won't appear - On page 11 of bugs.
  
Misplaced/incorect Quest Comments - Page 3. Seems like a patch/fix needs to be made/can be made.
  
MCM Distance not working - Page 4. It's my own bug lol.
  
MCM Resets won't work - Check it out on page 10.
  
No Lover's Comfort (marriage quest) - No known fix atm, but check the comments under "Lover's Comfort" page 17. Might be fixed in 2.51.
  
No more idle commentary - Page 4. No known fix. You could try the reset commands & disable/enable. Usually caused by something overwriting her AI.
  
Premature Lines During Molag Quest/Vigilant Tyrannus - Page 12 in document. Could be fixed in esp by the sounds of it.
  
Relationship won't go above xx - No fix as of yet. Page 1.
  
Tracking Marker missing from quests - No known fix yet. Check out page 9 for more info.**Everything else:**Spoiler(xEdit error) EStreamError: SetFilePointerEx failed (game won't start) - Unsure. This particular user might've been using LE. Page 12.
  
Won't get drunk - No known fix. Try all the resets, and a full reset (bring her to stables) or loading an old save may be required.
  
Papyrus Log spamming - Check page 7.
  
Save game stopped working - No fix known as of yet.[/spoiler]
  
Compatibility Untested/Unresolved:
  
Spoiler[Convenient Horses](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9519) - Can't find any conflicts in xEdit & I don't think these files would affect her. Wouldn't know where to start with a patch.
  
Creation Club Campsite (couldn't find mod) - Apparently you gotta dismiss her when you go to sleep. Not sure though.
  
[Frostfall](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/671) + [EVG Conditional Idles](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34006) - Page 2. Apparently, it doesn't affect Sofia. I assume this is because Sofia isn't "added" to those mods base. Conjecture.[No Essential Npcs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/737) - Not aware of a fix. You could use [Make ALL NPCs non essential](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/48039) instead but I haven't tried it.
  
[Sleep for me now](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40956) & [Auto Sleep For Me Now](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56850) - Seems like it wouldn't work without messing up Sofia's scripting/packaging.
  
Skyrim Survival (mod name unknown at present) - These scripts bug survival "sofiacommentscript.pex" & "jjsofiaquestupdatescript.pex".
  
[SkyTEST - Realistic Animals and Predators SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1104) - No current known fix yet. Try using [Savage Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37768) as an alternative for animal behaviour.
