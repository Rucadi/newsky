Do NPCs block too much?
  
  
Have you ever encountered enemies who endlessly hold up their shields — refusing to attack or do anything else?
  
  
This mod fixes that issue.
  
  
It uses Open Animation Replacer (OAR) to cancel the block automatically when NPCs are moving while blocking, after a short delay.
  
  
  
  
  
? FAQ
  
  
**Q. Will this remove blocking entirely?**
  
A. No — NPCs can still block when standing still. This method only cancels blocking when the NPC is moving while blocking.
  
**Q. Can I use this alongside NPC AI mods?**
  
A. Absolutely. This mod only adds animations with conditions — it does not touch AI logic.
  
  
**Q. There are already many similar mods on Nexus. What makes yours different?**
  
**A.** I’ve tried all the similar mods available on Nexus, but none of them worked for me. That’s why I decided to create a mod with a more direct and verifiable effect. It only uses animations through Open Animation Replacer (OAR), without relying on any ESP files or scripts.
