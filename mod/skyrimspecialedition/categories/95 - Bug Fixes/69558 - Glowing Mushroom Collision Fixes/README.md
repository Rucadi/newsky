[font=Georgia]Overview:[/font][font=Lucida Sans Unicode][font=Georgia]
  
[/font]
  
[/font]Ever get frustrated with how difficult glowing mushrooms are to pick? Trying to get them off cave walls is like plucking nose hairs with chopsticks. This mod gives the mushrooms a larger, easy to select hitbox so you can finally harvest to your heart's content.
  
  
As this is a simple mesh replacer, the included meshes will overwrite vanilla resources and the mod has no plugin file. This mod only replaces the collision of the static objects (ie. the glowing mushrooms growing on cave walls). The glowing mushroom ingredient that you can interact with in your inventory and drop into the worldspace is unchanged. No other changes were made to the vanilla models in the main file.
  
  
  
[font=Georgia][size=5]Requirements:[/font][/size]
  
  
None for the main file.
  
  
If using the included patch for [Skyrim Particle Patch for ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65720), the particle patch is required.
  
If using the included patch for [High Poly Project](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12029), you should have High Poly Project installed to maintain consistency between the static and ingredient meshes.
  
If using the included patch for [Glowing Mushrooms by Mari](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44464) or [Mari's Flora](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45952), one of these mods is required.
  
If using the included patch for [Diverse Mari's Glowing Mushrooms](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99184), ModiLogist's mod is required.
  
If using the included patch for [Rudy HQ - More Lights for ENB SE - Glowing Mushrooms](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40991), Rudy’s mod is required.
  
  
  
[font=Georgia][size=5]Installation:[/font][/size]
  
  
Simply install the files with the mod manager of your choice. The FOMOD installer will guide you through the installation of this mod and any optional patches.
  
  
  
[font=Georgia][size=5]Compatibility:[/font][/size]
  
  
This mod replaces the following meshes:
  

  
* Data\meshes\plants\glowingmushroomcluster01.nif
Data\meshes\plants\glowingmushroomsingle01.nif
  
* Data\meshes\plants\switchnodechildren\glowingmushroomcluster01\_1.nif
Data\meshes\plants\switchnodechildren\glowingmushroomsingle01\_1.nif
  

[left][/left]
  
  
Any other mod that make edits to the same meshes as this mod will be **incompatible** (eg. [Realistic HD Mushrooms Remastered](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21996)﻿﻿, [Enhanced Lights and FX](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2424), etc). However, anyone is free to use these files to implement the same solution into non-vanilla glowing mushroom models (see permissions for details).
  
  
Mods that change *only the textures* of glowing mushrooms (eg. [Rally's Glowing Mushrooms](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29098), [Cathedral - Mushrooms](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26103), etc) are **compatible**.
  
  
The FOMOD installer for version 3.01 of [Animated Tentacles for the Glowing Mushrooms](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56981) contains an option to integrate the collision fixes from this mod. **The files from this mod page are not required if you choose that option.** 
  
  
*Reported to be compatible with Skyrim VR, but I'm not able to test it or provide detailed support for the VR version of the game. If you have issues, please still report it, but I can’t guarantee it will be fixed if the issue is specific to VR.*

Optional Patches for Specific Mods:
[/size][/font]
  

[list]
  
* If you are using [Glowing Mushrooms by Mari](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44464)﻿ or [Mari's Flora](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45952)﻿, select the optional patch in the FOMOD installer. The FOMOD installer will guide you through selecting the options that correspond to your current installation of Mari's mod. Mari's mod should be installed before this mod so you know which options to choose. After installation, the files from this mod should be **allowed to overwrite the files from Mari's mod.** The files from either of Mari's mods are **required** for this version to function as intended.
    
  If you *also* have Skyrim Particle Patch installed, Mari’s mushrooms should be overwriting it since her meshes implement a similar solution already. In this case select **only the patch for Mari’s mushrooms** in the FOMOD installer, and allow this mod to overwrite both other mods.

Known Issues:
  

  
* Occasionally the single mushrooms will have their selection "obscured" by the cluster mushroom mesh if they are close together. As this is mostly a placement issue, there's not much I can do to further improve selection by just editing the meshes. If you encounter this issue, try changing the angle that you are looking at the mushroom, or moving your cursor slightly away from the other mushrooms in the same area.
For some reason, Bethesda level designers have sometimes used the Havok enabled ingredient mesh implanted in walls rather than just placing the static mushroom mesh. The ingredient mesh should be easy to select, but let me know if you have trouble.
