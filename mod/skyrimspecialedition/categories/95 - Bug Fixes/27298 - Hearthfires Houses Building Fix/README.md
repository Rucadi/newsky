Proper models of building parts
  
  
♦ Description:
  
This mod restores proper models of some building parts and furniture in crafting menu.
  
Also changes names for exterior building parts and furniture (adds word "exterior", so you will not confused which part you should choose) and changes a bit recepies for house parts (condition for becoming constructable: you can't build second floor walls before first floor walls).
  
Some shelves and tables stays unfixed, because several different furniture use same one preview model.
