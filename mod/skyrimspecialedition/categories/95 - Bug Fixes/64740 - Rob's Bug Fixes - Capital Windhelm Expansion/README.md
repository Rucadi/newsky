Simple replacer .esp for Surjamente's Capital Windhelm Expansion.  Fixes a variety of record level errors reported by CK and cleaned up a bunch of navmesh issues.  No major fixes/ building adjustments/etc.
  
Also forwaded USSEP changes via The Method and included a .modgroups file to hide the remaining conflicts.
  
  
This is for version 1.3 of Capital Whiterun Expansion, the NON crf version.
