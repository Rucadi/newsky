[size=3]**Description**
  
  
This mod fixes bandit falling rock traps at [Pinewatch](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Pinewatch) and [Knifepoint Ridge](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Knifepoint_Ridge) triggering when they shouldn't. They're still shit, but a bit better, i've wrote new scripts for them.
  
  
The following issues are fixed:
  
  
The bridge near Pinewatch:

* The traps are completely autonomous from the bandits and trigger even if they are already dead, far from the trap or not in combat. With this mod there must be a bandit in combat state on the tower to trigger the trap on it (even though they don't intentionally stay there. i could implement that later but i'm not sure when to make them go to the towers and when to release them).
One of the two traps could only be triggered by the player (may be intentional).
  

Knifepoint Ridge:
  

  
* After the location resets the trap gets triggered as soon as combat starts even if you haven't approached the trigger area yet.
If the bandit wasn't near the lever when you entered the trigger area, the trap triggers once he approaches the lever even if you already left the trigger area.
  
* Not only bandits can trigger the trap by walking near the lever but anyone, including non-humanoid actors and your allies.

This mod also prevents the traps from triggering if there are bandits or their allies in the trigger area. This doesn't help much since the bandits don't care and run through the falling rocks anyway, but at least it will reduce friendly fire a bit.
