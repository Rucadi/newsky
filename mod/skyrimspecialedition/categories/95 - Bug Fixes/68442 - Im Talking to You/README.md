# Im Talking to You

Recently I made a [similar mod for Fallout 4](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/60363) and while the problem is bigger in FO4, I thought Skyrim could use it as well.
  
  
This mod is for people who enjoy the Skyrim style of conversations, but are tired of NPCs walking away from them during a conversation.
  
  
  
How this mod works is, when the script detects you are talking to an NPC, it tells the NPC to stop and think about what it should be doing. (Usually it's to stop and talk to you) As a safety net, it also tells the NPC to stay near you while the NPC is talking to you. If this mod is working correctly, you'll forget you even have it installed.
  
 
  
  
It's highly compatible, it should work with every mod. It works with AE and SE as well. That being said, if you find an NPC that reacts poorly to this mod, let me know in the posts.
