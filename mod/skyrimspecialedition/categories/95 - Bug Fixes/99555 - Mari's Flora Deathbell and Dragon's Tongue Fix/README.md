# Mari's Flora Deathbell and Dragon's Tongue Fix

This mod edits 4 meshes from the base game (deathbells) and 4 meshes from Mari's Flora (dragon's tongues) to fix the shading on them. I'm going to call it fixing because ~~whether or not the glowing is intentional~~ it is very distracting to me. *(Author stated dragon's tongue glow is intentional, I simply prefer it without.)*
  
  
My mod is designed to be used with Fixed Mesh Lighting (though not a requirement) as that mod fixes the same glow issue with other Mari's Flora plants such as mountain flowers and tundra cotton. Allow the meshes from this mod to overwrite the meshes from Mari's Flora. This mod shouldn't affect anything else. Sort of an unofficial addon to Fixed Mesh Lighting. 
  
  
Please report any issues. If you'd like to buy me a coffee:
