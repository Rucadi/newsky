[font=Tahoma]One of the most forgotten places in the world of Skyrim finally gets some love and I'd say it really needed it. The meshes related to Sovngarde are a complete mess with incorrect UV maps, disjointed mesh parts and holes here and there. This mod aims to fix all of these problems and make Sovngarde great again.
