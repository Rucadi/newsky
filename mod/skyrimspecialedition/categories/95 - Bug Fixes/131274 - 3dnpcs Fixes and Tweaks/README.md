Current Fixes. 
  
  
-Mojin has been added the appropriate faction to stop North Watch's guards from attacking him. Now he wont always be dead long before you meet him.
  
  
-Mojin has been given a merchant inventory. Now if you recruit him to your inn he actually sells skooma. 
  
  
- Having high spell absorption will no longer prevent you casting the 3 new conjuration spells added by 3dnpcs.
  
  
- Alassea was supposed to have an additional conversation option if your character is a werewolf. But due to an incorrect dialogue condition it was impossible to trigger. This has been fixed. Now you can actually talk to her about being a Werewolf.
  
  
- 3dnpcs clothing merchant in Riften had a minor bug where he would get more gold if you have invested in Radiant Raiment. As this makes no sense I fixed it. 
  
  
-The Axe of Forgotten Kings will no longer respawn
  
  
-Some minor issues with the quest "To Bite the Hand that feeds you"
  
  
-Adds an alternate ending to the vanilla quest "That was always there." Now you can have Alaessa handle the situation with her aunt if she's with you.
  
  
- Fixes a issue with 3dnpcs sentient Mannequin's dialogue. Now he will no longer repeat his intro dialogue long after you've recruited him.
  
  
-Made it so taking items from Ariele basement is no longer considered stealing. Given that you can't acess the basement until after she's dead and her cabin is in the middle of nowhere. It makes little sense that the guards would enforce ownership over those items. Especially since she tries to kill you.
  
  
- Random items in Ariele's house are no longer owned by Sven and his mom (Yes the guy from Riverwood.) You can now use it as a player home after the quest. (Might want to wait for the bodies to despawn first through lol.)
  
  
-Arele's basement will no longer respawn. Given that's she and her wards are dead by the time you can acess it. It makes little sense for it to be restocked.
  
  
- Marla will no longer sandbox outside of her cell if she's arrested.
  
  
- 3dnpc dialogue will now recognize a wider range of fine clothes, including most fancy outfits from mods in their dialogue. So you'll no longer be told off for not wearing nice clothes, if you're wearing fine clothes from BS Bruma.
  
  
- Kianna now has a Iron dagger. So she will no longer steal Borvir's dagger off the ground. Her stealing the dagger would potentially causing issues for players who use Legacy of the Dragonborn. Or mods that restore the quest it's tied to. 
  
  
- Deneris's combat AI has been improved.
  
  
- Some of Thrice-Bitten's dialogue has been fixed and will now use the correct audio files. Special thanks to GiraPomba for this fix.
  
  
- Fixed another issue with the "Axe of Forgotten Kings." It will no longer be sitting around in Helga's bunk house the moment the game starts. It will now only be enabled once the appropriate quest starts. 
  
  
- Wander-Lust's winterhold package accidentally pointed towards Aranea Ienith instead of the Shrine of Azura. As a result of Araenea was following you Wander-Lust would stalk you on Tirdas. This has been fixed.

Quick showcase of one of the fixes: Now Mojin will actually sell skooma :D
  
  
  
  
Sadly while this mod can be installed mid game. Both of Mojin's fixes wont kick in until you start a new game. As his facitons are baked into your save.
  
  
**Compatibility:**If you're using "Helgen Reborn" or something similar that rebuilds Helgen. Get the optional file that ties Ashwood's enable reference to Dragon Rising instead of the destruction of Helgen. To avoid a minor conflict.
