SKSE DLL that will fix rim lighting (glow) issues with equipped armor and clothing, as well as creatures and a variety of objects on the fly, without needing to download additional mesh fixes for buggy mods. Everything is done while you play, and no game or mod files are edited!
  
  
Made with CommonLibSSE NG, so it should support be universally compatible with all other mods and all Skyrim versions (post LE, except for ﻿1.6.353).
  
  
Installation:
  
Drag the zip file into your mod manager of choice.
  
  
NOTE:
  
This mod is fully compatible with Glow Be Gone. The mods do two very different things!
