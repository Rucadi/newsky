**[b]Description**
  
  
[/b]This mod will change the height of the first person camera to match the height (scale) of the player as determined by gender and race. It uses a small script that will only run at specific events: game load, race change, getting up from furniture and after using racemenu. The plugin is ESL flagged.
  
  
It is based on "[Player Size Adjuster and First Person Camera Height Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/32155)". I ported it to SE, isolated the camera height fix and removed everything else. In the process I fixed the bug described [here](https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/topic/6293406-player-size-adjuster-and-first-person-camera-height-fix-sse/page-19#entry71456778) and added compatibility with Go to bed and similar mods.
  
**Requirements**SKSE
  
RaceMenu SE (only for High Heels version)
  
**Compatibility**
