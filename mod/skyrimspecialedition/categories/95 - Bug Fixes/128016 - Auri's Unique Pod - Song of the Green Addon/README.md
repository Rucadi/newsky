# Auri's Unique Pod - Song of the Green Addon

This is a very simple mod that just changes Auri's pod to use the same bark on the outside as it does inside. Useful if you have a mod such as Rally's Solstheim which changes the default Telvanni wood textures. (in my case it was resulting in a blue pod)
  
  
I recommend using an interior overhaul such as [4K Tel Mithryn at Skyrim Special Edition Nexus - Mods and Community (nexusmods.com)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39994?tab=files)
