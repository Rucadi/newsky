Say goodbye to that awkward moment when you're just trying to jump a little and suddenly your player character becomes a bird, and you can't do anything about it, you just either wait it out or jump again
  
  
Credits to [Ershin](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Ershin) for making OAR, no need to generate behavior files and it has tons of added conditions for fixing bugs like this, I highly recommend [Open Animation Replacer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/92109) it's even compatible with DAR files, I've provided my custom settings of OAR in the optional files in case you want it for stability
  
  
If you want to test this quickly you can go outside of Whiterun's Dragonsreach, just jump up the stairs, you will encounter this bug frequently there, and also up the stairs at Jorrvaskr's Skyforge.

**Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**
  
Compatibility: Currently compatible with all mods, this mod doesn't edit the same functions from other mods related to jump, falling, and landing. Feel free to test and report back if you find any problems, and please endorse as well if it works for you, I've tested this a lot of times, and the bug is 100% squashed
