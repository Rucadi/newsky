The survival mode attack speed debuffs contrary to one might think increase weapon speed rather than decrease it in order to slow down one's weapon. This is because the default weapon speed mult is 0, and to boost it by 0.8 will put it at 80% of it's speed. This doesn't function the best however since a speed of 0 is equal to 1, and a speed of 1 is equal to 1.
  
  
Many Weapon Speed Fixes fix this in their own way, allowing for smart decremental values, however the debuffs from Survival Mode don't adhere to these changes, making them function speed up attacks instead unintentionally.
