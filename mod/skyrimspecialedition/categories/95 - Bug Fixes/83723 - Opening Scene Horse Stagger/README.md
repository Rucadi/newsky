The way in which this mod attempts to accomplish this does not directly touch the main quest, but the horses themselves. This mod adds a new script to horses used in the opening scene (not base objects or quest aliases) which measures the distance within a certain range to the horse it is following and adjusts the speed for the horse that is using the script.
