Somehow the mod hdt-smp/ faster hdt-smp messed up the skeleton of the lurkers from the dragonborn dlc and caused them to keep having the infamous T-pose glitch. XPMSSE fixed the issue but the fix was not applied to the bone colossus added by cc, which used the skeleton of the lurkers. This mod simply replaces the bone colossus skeleton with the fixed lurker skeleton.
