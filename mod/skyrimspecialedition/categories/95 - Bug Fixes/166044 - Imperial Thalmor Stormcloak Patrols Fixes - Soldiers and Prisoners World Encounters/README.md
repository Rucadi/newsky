**Description**
  
  
Fixes bugs with imperial, thalmor and stormcloak patrols random world encounters (with and without prisoners):
  
  
1) In vanilla the Imperial, Thalmor and Stormcloak soldiers in patrols and the prisoners that they escort all get added to the "crime faction" of the hold that they spawn in, which makes them report crimes in this hold like its regular settlement inhabitants. The first problem with this is that they report crimes and you get a bounty for attacking them even if they spawn in a hold controlled by the opposite faction. The second problem with this is that the prisoners report crimes done to their captors, and any other crimes, which they also probably wouldn't want or couldn't report due to them being... prisoners.
  
With this mod Imperial and Thalmor soldiers in patrols don't report crimes in holds controlled by the Stormcloaks and in Whiterun before Balgruuf sides with the Empire (technically they don't get added to the "crime faction" if they're not in a hold controlled by their faction). Stormcloaks don't report crimes in holds controlled by the Empire and in Whiterun before it's taken by the Stormcloaks (though apparently they only spawn in Stormcloak-controlled holds, unlike Imperials and Thalmor). The prisoner only gets added to the crime faction of the current hold after he is freed, and only if the hold is controlled by his faction.
  
A limitation of this mod: you won't get a bounty for attacking the prisoner if the soldiers escorting him saw you attacking him (but they will still attack you immediately).
  
  
2) Fixed the behavior of the prisoner and the soldiers when you attack either of them.
  
In vanilla with USSEP:
  

  
* if you attack the Imperial soldiers escorting a prisoner - the prisoner gets freed and attacks you, helping his captors.
if you attack the prisoner escorted by Imperial soldiers - the prisoner stays tied but becomes hostile to you. the soldiers aggro on both you and him, and try to kill both of you. 
  
* if you attack the Thalmor soldiers escorting a prisoner - the prisoner stays away from the fight, staying tied. (OK)
[size=2]if you attack the prisoner escorted by Thalmor soldiers  - [size=2]the prisoner gets freed and attacks you, helping his captors. [size=2]the soldiers aggro on both you and him, and try to kill both of you[/size][/size][/size]
  

This mod completes an incomplete USSEP fix for these behaviors. With this mod, if you attack the soldiers, the prisoner doesn't get freed and doesn't become hostile to you. If you attack the prisoner, he doesn't get freed and the soldiers don't become hostile to him - he will stay in place tied and hostile to you (with [size=2][size=2][The Clever Prisoner](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/84348)[/size] he will run away) and the soldiers will attack you. After attacking the prisoner you can still free him, then he will become friendly to you.[/size]
  
  
3) In vanilla, if all captors are killed, the prisoner runs away. With USSEP, when that happens, the prisoner frees himself (USSEP Bug #12994). But when he does that, he also says the dialogue line, thanking you for saving him, as if you just freed him.
  
With this mod he won't thank you in this case if you, your followers or summons weren't the ones who killed any of his captors.
