[YOU CAN FIND VARIOUS PATCHES FOR USMP HERE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50813)
  
 
  
USMP now Requires [BEES](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441) for older version users
  
  
Anyone having CTD issues can have their crashlog read by [Google's AI.](https://gemini.google.com/app)  It's actually quite good.
  
  
[Console users can get USMP Here](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/details/09e7b824-c9f1-4e13-b6cb-57bc19d3bb98/USMP_SE___Unofficial_Skyrim_Modders_Patch_2_6_6)
  
  
 
  
The version prior to 2.6.7 that incorporated [Ultimate Optimized Scripts Compilation](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/122999)﻿  into USMP, which requires a new SKSE master file. [powerofthree's Papyrus Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22854)  has been removed.   As of version 2.6.7, the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International license UOSC has adopted, makes it ineligible to be included in USMP and there-fore, Powerofthree's Papyrus Extender will no longer be a USMP requirement Going forward, Only a single version of USMP will be offered that does not include UOSC.  As a result I Highly recommend placing [Ultimate Optimized Scripts Compilation](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/122999)﻿  above USMP so that Scrote which is still included into USMP can overwrite as required.
  
  
See the bottom of the page for links to Removed Mods
  
  
First off, I want to thank PlagueHush for allowing me to port this beauty to Skyrim Special Edition.  Modding Skyrim creates conflicts.  Many of these conflicts are desirable and are in fact the basis of modding Bethesda titles.  There may be times however, when other mods will overwrite USMP and you will have to decide which changes you want to use.  This is where patching and conflict resolution come into play.  You can allow other mods to overwrite USMP to get their changes or use a patch to make the two mods play nicely together.  In any event, I have tried to only include mods that are widely compatible and/or that can be overwritten easily.   Happy Modding.
  
  
Installation.   Install with your mod manager of choice.  If you are installing manually, you don't need any instructions, because you clearly know what your doing.  If you don't, you should be using a mod manager.  
  
 If you are updating on an ongoing save, then you definitely need to get your character somewhere inside a house or inn and out of the larger worldspace.  The Critterspawn Congestion fix needs to fix the worldspace bugs and will cause issues if you are not in a contained world-space like an inn or home that doesn't have spawn points. 
  
  
Updating and new installs are always best on a new game. 
  
  
Load order and Asset order with USMP has changed slightly and should be:
  
Base Game
  
CC Content
  
USSEP
  
USCCCP
  
~~*Vanilla Script (Micro)Optimizations*~~  (Incorporated with UOSC)
  
*Script Optimization and Fixes Compilation - or - Ultimate Optimized Scripts Compilation (both need to be archived in a .bsa file)*
  
Navigator - Navmesh Fixes
  
USMP
  
all other esms
  
esps
  
patches
  
  
  
Check out the Articles Tab.  There is a very useful article there that has a lot of relevant information on modding. Thank you  [missjennabee](https://forums.nexusmods.com/index.php?/user/3123219-missjennabee/)you may also want to check out [icecreamassassin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/2846158)'s [Best Practices for Modding and Playing Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/3289).
  
  
I humbly offer you the USMP.  The UNOFFICIAL SKYRIM MODDERS PATCH.  A collection of fixes and resources for modders.
  
  
You find the original [UNOFFICIAL SKYRIM MODDERS PATCH for Skyrim Legendary Edition Here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/76101?)  Though there is an updated LE version in the Download section.

Skyrim is an epic game, and modding is the epic minigame that goes along with it!  Still, it's not without its issues and once you get under the hood it doesn't take long before you notice the many inconsistencies, shortcuts, half finished changes, and plain old mistakes that Bethesda made when they were putting together this fantastic game. This is where the [Unofficial Skyrim Modder's Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49616) comes in!
  
  
USMP is a large, community-collected compilation of fixes for the many bugs, inconsistencies, and errors that are either completely visual (placement of objects, or object models not being set up correctly) or only come to light from a modded install of Skyrim and its DLCs. Curated with both mod-makers and players in mind to aid the in-game experience, and serve as a base so that mod authors don't need to keep finding, fixing, and working around the same old problems. With all of these in a single ESP, it means it's load order friendly too so you can add more mods instead of using up your precious ESP limit just trying to fix things!
  
  
**For a full list of everything that has been fixed so far, please see the 'Changes' tab above or the Credits below.**
  
  
  
This isn't the first mod to try to fix the underlying issues with Skyrim, but it IS the first to attempt to fix the issues that make modding the game such a minefield in such a comprehensive way.
  
  
This mod is in no way affiliated with, nor endorsed by, the [Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266) team, nor should they be expected to do so. The team there work to a very specific design goal and it differs from ours, so please don't nag them about this mod or the fixes contained within it!

The Unofficial Skyrim Modder's Patch (USMP) is intended to help you. The whole purpose of collecting these bugfixes together is to keep everyone
  
up-to-date, and the impact on load orders to an absolute minimum. 
  
  
Permissions for redistribution, conversion, or releasing 'updated' versions of USMP are not permitted - but only so that we can keep all of these fixes in one place.
  
  
Uploading USMP as a whole to other sites is not permitted - but only because having a single central source means that everyone can stay up-to-date easier. If you have friends who don't use the Nexus, you should still feel free to send them a copy!

Because of prior perm limitations, USMP can not adopt the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International license and I've had to remove mods by wSkeever and going forward,  the Ultimate Optimized Scripts Compilation.  While this is unfortunate, it simply means those mods must be used in addition to USMP.
