While remodeling my modlist to switch to parallax, I noticed that the parallax textures were behaving strangely, so I searched and found the problem.
  
  
  

  
* Fix the door geometry
Version Normal and Parallax
  
* Version Skyland, add the mesh and the \_p texture for this door. (You need Skyland AIO or Skyland Windhelm)
No ESP, safe to intall/uninstall anytimes !
  

  
Enjoy !
  
  
  
If you use a mod that changes this door it will not be useful to you. But if you want to try it anyway, place it in your LO afterwards.
