**Description**
  

  
* Auri's Mount Thistlefoot's texture sets were messed up. This fixes it.
Only edits the 018NakedaurimountAA armorAA and 018AuriMounttexture texture set records.
  
[list]* 97.51% guaranteed to be compatible with whatever other Auri thing you have.
Very likely not compatible with anything that edits the Thistlefoot mesh. I know of no such mods.
  

[\*][2 Options](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/131793/131793-1729341344-860981866.png):
  

  
* Option 1: keep the clutter at the back. This leaves some items with missing NiAlphaProperty there. I can't fix this without including the original assets, so I didn't.
Option 2: hide the clutter at the back. This hides the items with missing NiAlphaProperty.
  

[\*]ESL.
  
[\*]Still required as of Auri 2.0.
