Fixes delphine stuck when she enters skyhaven temple for the first time. If she and esbern enters first, somehow delphine will lose her torch and become stuck in the entrance corridor preventing the quest to continue.
  
  
This is actually vanilla bug that was fixed by USSEP, but USSEP team only made sure that delphine equip a torch, which would turn useless when she somehow lost her torch (bugthesda). I change the function to give her a torch instead.
  
  
Let this mod overwrites USSEP.
