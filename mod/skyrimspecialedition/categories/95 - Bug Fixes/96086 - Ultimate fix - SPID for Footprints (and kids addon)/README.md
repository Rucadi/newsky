[color=#93c47d]Ultimate fix - SPID for Footprints

  
[/color]
  
  
  
Overview
  
And again... after some time, after those mighty battles with hundreds of npcs and so on and so forth SPID for Footprints again stopped produce prints on NPC and my character. So again I needed to manually edit my very old savefile in ReSaver, but im done with that. NO MORE!
  
Here comes this ultimate fix for SPID version to finally put to the end all problems with SPID for Footprints and especially to that dissapearing prints.
  
  
Fixes and changes

* fixed scripts and functions to properly count npcs with footprints
removed old counting behavior which is unnecessary because cloaked effect in no more used
  
* adjusted logic so footprints are counted for npcs in loaded area and will reset if player leave current cells
added optional 'child addon' for footprints
  
* proper changes to conditions to make new counting scheme much more reliable
fixed bug which could occur after transforming into beast mod (vampireLord or werewolf)
  
* other insignificant fixes like: notification, removed unused properties of scripts etc.

Installation
  
Normal procedure if you want to switch from original version to SPID.
  
  
If you already use SPID version (to make sure that everything will fire nicely):
  
1) Make sure that you use version 3.4 of SPID for Footprints.
  
2) Fast travel from open area to town and go to interior cell.
  
3) Disable mod in MCM.
  
4) Uninstall every other fixes (if used) which edits scripts, magicEffect, quest and spell conditions for footprints or changes their script properties or variables. (You may also need to make additional clean save after uninstalling any old fixes)
  
5) Install this fix.
  
6) Run game, open MCM, change options to desired values or use new defaults.
  
7) Use 'Reset counts' function from MCM and follow the instructions.
  
8) Go for a walk in snow and leave a sign that you were here...
  
9) Optionally install new supported version for heels addon.
