I reworked a few High Hrothgar interior meshes upon request to fix bad geometry, gaps and seams as well as wrong vertex colours. I'm only reworking stairs meshes, those gaps were really visible when climbing them.

- I fixed wrong geometry, aligned vertex to fix seams and gaps.
  
  
- I fixed wrong vertex colours that weren't making much sense and painted new smoother ones.
  
  
- I tweaked one UV a bit to improve the stairs stonework layout.
  
  
- I made an optional optimized version for lighting mods to prevent those meshes from breaking because of engine limits.

Not compatible with any other similar mesh hence why I made a Lux/ELFX compatible version so it just works with lighting mods reworked meshes.
