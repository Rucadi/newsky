# Weapon Switch Animation Fix - Behavior Patch Version
- Author: illuke00
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/125415


**Description:**
  
This behavior patch fixes a problem where the locomotion animation (movement animation) does not switch to the appropriate one for the weapon when switching to another weapon type while moving with the weapon drawn. This problem occurs with one-handed weapons, two-handed weapons, bows, crossbows, and unarmed (when something is equipped in the left hand).
  
  
There is already a [mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/100366) that attempts a similar fix, but this one has the advantage of being more compatible with the animation replacer.
  
  
  
**Requirements:**
  

  
* [Nemesis](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60033) ﻿or [Pandora](https://github.com/Monitor221hz/Pandora-Behaviour-Engine-Plus/releases)﻿
(optional) [Weapon Styles - Draw-Sheathe animations for IED](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85085)﻿ -- A patch is available to fix a problem where the animation is not applied to the left arm when switching weapons during movement when using Weapon Styles.
  

  
  
**Compatibility:**
  

  
* [Combat Gameplay Overhaul SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33767)﻿ -- Not compatible, as CGO already contains a similar fix.

  
  
**Installation:**
  
Install with the Mod Manager and run with "Weapon Switch Animation Fix - Behavior Patch Version" enabled in Nemesis or Pandora.
