[Requirements]
  
[Skyrim's Paraglider](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53256)
  
  
[Features]
  

  
* **Fix Dark Face Fred -** Generated the missing Face for [size=4]Falling  Fred.[/size]
**Fix Quest not starting properly -** Makes sure Fred will always become Falling Fred. 
  
Instead of being T-Posing-In-Mid-Air Fred. 50% of the time, [size=4]it works every time.
  
[/size]* **No plugin**

  
  
[Issues]
  

  
* **Will not fix retroactively -** If your game is bugged already with T-Posing Fred, load a save before that happens. Saving and Loading around Fred with that bug will make him appear on the ground, without a journal and the quest will not start. If that happens you can try dragging Fred away from the spot, maybe to Falkreath. Then, drag him back in to activate a trigger and start the quest.
