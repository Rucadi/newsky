At least for me the original mod had an issue where loading a save would cause the alias' used to not be filled which caused the new packages to not be applied which meant that the scene wouldn't play, this should fix that.
  
  
If you don't have any issues with the original mod, you don't need this, additionally this will break the mods functionality in any save that has had the original mod installed. I have not tested it on an existing save without the original mod.
