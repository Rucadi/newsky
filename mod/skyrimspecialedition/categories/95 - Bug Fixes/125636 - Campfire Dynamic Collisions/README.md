This mod adds dynamic collisions to every object that you can craft with Campfire.
  
  
What are dynamic collisions? They are a different type of collision layer embedded directly in the various 3D models and that allow NPCs to recognize them as an obstacle to avoid when for example they are trying to reach the player during a fight.
  
  
Normally if we want an NPC to recognize any object (trees, clutters, structures) as an obstacle we have two options, edit the navmeshes or create navcut boxes, although all this is possible with mods that place these objects preemptively, I am referring for example to all those mods that add trees or buildings, this is not possible with mods like Campfire that allow the player to place structures and furniture wherever the player wants.
  
  
As you can see from the gifs below, bandits purposely avoid the tent placed by the player, this goes for any other object such as tanning racks or cooking pots.
  
  
Campfire Dynamic Collision comes in two versions, the classic one where all objects don't have a physical collision so that its impossible for followers to get stuck, enemies will still avoid colliding with the objects you create but both you and your followers will be able to pass through them as if they were not there, exactly like happens by default in Campfire.
  
In the second version all objects have a physical collision, if a follower gets stuck in a tent it will still be possible to pack and place it in another spot in order to unstuck the follower.
