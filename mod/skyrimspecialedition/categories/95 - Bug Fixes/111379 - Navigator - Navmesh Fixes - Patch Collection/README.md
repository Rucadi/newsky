A FOMOD collection of some [Navigator](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52641) patches (for the .esl AIO version only for ESO and Helgen Reborn, sorry):
  
  
**Aldmeri Cultured Furniture**: Edited Navigator's navmesh to align with changed furniture, added navmesh under several chairs and added navcuts instead because they only have a "front" marker.  Please let me know if there are chairs that npcs just will not use in Thalmor Embassy.
  
  
**Another Redbelly Mine Mod**: Forwards Redbelly Mine's navmesh.
  
  
**Cidhna Mine Expanded**: Forwards Cidhna Mine with some tweaks in Druadach Redoubt.
  
  
**Dungeons Revisited**: Mostly forwards Dungeons Revisited's navmesh, since it makes substantial changes to the cells.
  
  
**ESO Imports**: Mostly forwards Navigator, but adds a bit more navmesh to Folgunthur to cover changes.  Handles ESO door change in Skuldafn. Combines navmesh changes in Gloomreach. Requires Navigator .esl master because of new navmesh references.
  
  
**Helgen Reborn**: Uses Navigator but adds navcuts to added structures in Sightless Pit.  Finalizes door into Shriekwind Bastion, Skybound Pass, Brittleshin Pass.  Requires Navigator .esl master because of new navmesh references.
  
  
**Immersive Citizens**: Forwards Immersive Citizens navmesh in Darkwater Crossing Goldenrock Mine, and Whistling Mine.
  
  
**Khajiit Will Follow**: Forwards KWF in Kagrenzel because of its extensive edits.
  
  
**Legacy of the Dragonborn**: Forwards LOTD in Mzulft04.  Adds door and additional navmesh to Navigator in Sightless Pit.  Additional navmesh added to Navigator's changes in Valthume.  Additional navmesh added to Navigator in Windhelm Hall of the Dead.
  
  
**More Werewolves**: Forwards Navigator in Driftshade Cellar.
  
  
**Skyrim Sewers** + **JK's Palace of the Kings**: For SkyrimSewersNavFix.  Handles adjustments on palace side to sewer door.
  
  
**Skyrim Sewers** + **Snazzy JK's Palace of the Kings**: As above, but for Snazzy JK's further edits to positioning.
  
  
**Snozz's Fort Greymoor**: Forwards Fort Greymoor (including conflicting navcut boxes).
  
  
**Snozz's Redoran's Retreat**: Forwards Redoran.
  
  
**Teldryn Serious**: Forwards Navigator's changes with a slight edit around the added throne in Broken Oar Grotto. HEY YOU GUYS
  
  
**The Brotherhood of Old** / **JK's Bee and Barb** + **JK's Elgrim's Elixirs**: Individual and combo to finalize doors in Ratway.  JK interiors grouped together because if you use one you're probably using both.
  
  
**There Is No Umbra**: Forwards FloatingSwordFollower's navmesh in Purewater Run because it adds a structure there.  Forwarded navmesh and adjusted chair marker in Brood Cavern.
  
  
**Tools of Kagrenac**: Finalizes the portal in Silent Ruin into Navigator's navmesh edits.
  
  
A note about college mods:
  
You can load OCW, JK, or OCW-JK after Navigator and just let it overwrite. I didn't see any patches that needed to be made that wouldn't just be confirming the later loading mods.
