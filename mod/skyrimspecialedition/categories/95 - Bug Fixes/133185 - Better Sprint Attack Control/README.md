This mod is an extension of [Power Attack Direction Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71299) to affect sprint attacks.
  
Sprint attacks will now only be performed if you are holding the forward button.
  
I also added a condition to prevent sprint attacks when out of stamina.
  
This mod also includes a fix for left handed sprinting power attacks not being possible.
