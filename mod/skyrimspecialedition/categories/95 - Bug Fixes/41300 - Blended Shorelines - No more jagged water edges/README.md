**No jagged edges for water with no performance loss and it will not take up space in your load order due to it being an ESL flagged esp.**
  
  
*Will this work if I have another water mod?*
  
  
**Parcitcly yes all you need to do is make sure that your other water mod loads after this (overwrites) and essentially what this mod will do is make sure any waters that your water mod failed to go over are covered and look like they were made this side of the 2010s.**![](https://i.imgur.com/CmS87HR.gif)
