Stops traps from triggering a "Hit Sound Effect" and even applying diseases to Ethereal actors.
  
Removes effect for the lava too when ethereal as optional in the FOMOD.
  
  
How to lose immersion:
  
1. Become ethereal using become ethereal shout or other ethereal spells.
  
2. Get hit by traps
  
3. Notice that you are immune to damage but you hear the hit effect sound despite being ethereal.
  
4. Notice also that you get diseases somehow despite being ethereal.
  
5. Lose your immersion ~~and make this fix~~. and install this mod.

  [size=4][size=2]Fun fact: Dart traps actually uses a hand-to-hand weapon and forcefully makes them fire darts! The more you know[/size][/size]
Lava is just reskinned water. No wonder, they make you blind so you wont see whats really underneath there.
  
[size=2]You shouldn't be able to see through lava anyway, lava is pretty much just liquid rock but the fire effect is linked to the blind effect. No way around it.
