Hi !
  
  
Fix Nordic door and trap collisions that were requested long ago and very recently.
  
  
This is a really frustrating thing for stealth gamers. How many players have ever wanted to kill a npc through the bars of a door with an arrow and realize that the arrow does not pass because of an invisible wall?
  
  
This FYX fix that.
  
  
  
**In Short:**
  
  

  
* Fix Nordic door and trap collisions. Invisible wall => more detailed collisions. (Now you can kill anyone through the bars with a ranged weapon or spell)
Fix the bad UV of the frame on the portcullislarge.
  
* No ESP, Safe to install/Uninstall anytimes.

  
Enjoy !
