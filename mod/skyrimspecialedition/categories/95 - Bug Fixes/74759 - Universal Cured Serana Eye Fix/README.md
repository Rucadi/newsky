**Description**
  

  
* Serana's eyes might revert back to vampire eyes even if she's cured if you mess with Serana appearance mods. Mod fixes that.
Is not a hack.
  
[list]
  
* Reapplies method used by Bethesda to change Serana eye color on your new Serana replacer.
Works with various Serana replacers.
  
* Doesn't make vampire Serana have human eyes.
Doesn't rely on replacing vampire eye assets (textures or meshes) with human versions.
[\*]ESL (it takes less than a minute to check for yourself, folks)[/list]
  
**Installation**

  
* Install, uninstall, upgrade whenever.
Fix will remain even after uninstallation (until you mess with your Serana replacers again)
