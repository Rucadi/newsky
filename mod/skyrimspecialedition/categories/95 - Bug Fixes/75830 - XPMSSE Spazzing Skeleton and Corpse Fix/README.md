# XPMSSE Spazzing Skeleton and Corpse Fix

As noted above, this mod fixes the "spazzing" or flying skeleton/corpse bug encountered when you have XPMSSE installed (such as the skeletons/corpses at Folgunthur and Forelhost). In addition, it corrects some bugs from the original game after installing XPMSSE (notably the skeleton in Fort Helgen Torture Room).
  
  
This fix also works for mods that add additional skeleton corpses to the game, notably Morrowloot Ultimate (e.g. Bleak Falls Barrow).
  
  
Simply install via Mod Manager/Vortex, or install manually, extracting the zip file to the folder where your Skyrim exe file is located.
  
  
Regarding load order; for Vortex and Mod Managers, load this AFTER the original XPMSSE if prompted. For manual installs, simply overwrite the original files. 
  
  
The mod only affects XMPSSE draugr skeletal meshes, so shouldn't have any impact upon any human/NPCs or XPM derived mods (hopefully!).
  
  
Any questions or problems, please let me know!
