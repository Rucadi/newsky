This mod is the continuation of [Unofficial Skyrim SE Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13228). The mod has open permission and because I know this mod enough well and I love its fixes I decided to take care of it. I partially recover the original description to make this page. This mod contain new additional fixes for items and static objects in Skyrim world that aren't in both USSEP and Skyrim Landscape and Water Fixes.
  
  
Not official fixes. Lore-friendly. Fair and balanced. Harmless. Safe for work. Compatible with USSEP (this time for real) and Skyrim Landscape and Water Fixes. Updated to works well ALSO with AE and CC contents that aren't required.
  
**Partially list of fixes :**
  

  
* Fixed craft of Iron Ingot (2 Iron Ore for craft 1 Iron Ingot, accordingly to vanilla craft of other materials)
Fixed health amount of quest's Giant near Whiterun. Added an option that fixed also health amount, magic resistance, stagger resistance and unarmed damage **[b][color=#00ffff]version 1.2.2**[/color][/b]
  
* Fix of recepies of smelting dwarven items.
Fix of Redguard Child hair.
  
* Fix of weight for several items: leather, roll of paper, firewood, quill, doll, dragon scales, dragon bone.
Fix of weight of some other items, like scrap metal (correspondigly to materials and product of craft)
  
* Fix of NPC movements speed when sneaking and walking (accordingly to movement speed of NPCs).
Fix of Couriers behavior (changed from Average to Cowardly).
  
* Fix of Helgen gate (set to not respawn).
Fix of Frostflow Lighthouse (doors and items set to not respawn).
  
* Fix of Dragonsreach's dining tables (restored food on plates). (**optional with** **[b][color=#00ffff]version 1.2.2**[/color][/b]).
Fix of some objects in world, dungeons and caves (coordinates and scale mostly).
  
* Fix of Alchemist selling lists.
Fix of Dialogues lines (enemies won't say "Must have run off" about dead opponent).
  
* Disabled respawn of some unique quests related items.
Stops the Dawnguard vampire hunters random event if you have cured your vampirism.  **version 1.1**
  
* Fixes bug of NPC behiavor, when they ignores Player as Werewolf. **version 1.1**
Fixes bug of NPC behiavor, when they ignores Player as Vampire. **[b][color=#00ffff]version 1.2**[/color][/b]

Literally everything. This is a esp flagged both esm and esl. For this reason I advise you guys to not install this mid game. Load this after USSEP and Skyrim Landscape and Water Fixes.
  
If you are using the old version you can update it without start a new game.
