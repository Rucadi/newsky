**This mod has been included in [USSEP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266)﻿ 4.2.9a and is now redundant. The only advantage you get by downloading this on top of USSEP are some minor optimizations to the script.
  
  
  
Description**

  
  
One of the last quests in the Fishing creation questline is the "Beneath Bronze Waters" quest, during which you unlock the Dwarven fishing rod and get 2 new unique war axes. Unfortunately this quest can fail to start because of a rather dumb reason.
  
  
When you install the creation, 2 dwarven spiders are added right outside of the entrance to Bronze Water Cave in a dormant state. They are meant to only get out of their pipes and attack you when the quest is completed, but if you manage to trigger them beforehand by AOE spells or bashing into the hatches and then kill them, then leave the area for long enough for them to despawn, the quest will never start, because both are required aliases for it which won't get filled if they are despawned from the game. Doing this with even 1 of the spiders is enough to completely bug the quest in this way.
  
  
This mod changes both spider aliases in the quest to optional and disables the spiders until they should ambush you, so no matter what happens during your playthrough, those 2 spiders won't cockblock you from getting the Dwarven rod.
  
  
  

**Requirements**

  
  
[Anniversary Edition's Fishing creation](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Fishing)
  
  
  

**Installation**

  
  
Install with your favourite mod manager.
  
  
This mod works out of the box if you have not read the "Bounty: Dwarven Investigation" note yet. If you have and the quest has not started, you can use this console command to start it manually after installing this mod:Spoiler startquest ccBGSSSE001\_Misc\_Dwarven 
  
  
  

**Compatibility and load order**

  
  
**Not compatible** with anything that changes the "Beneath Bronze Waters" quest. Let me know of such cases and I'll make a patch.
  
**Compatible** with everything else.
  
  
Load after any mod that changes the same quest. If the quest is still not starting for whatever reason, let me know and I'll look into it.
