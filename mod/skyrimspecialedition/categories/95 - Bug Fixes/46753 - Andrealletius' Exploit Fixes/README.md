**Description**
  
  
**Disclaimer: Only the [color=#a2c4c9]Player Grab Stealing [color=#9fc5e8]Fix[/color] was made obsolete by [powerofthree's Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51073). The rest of these fixes are still relevant as far as I know. I've seen this misconception on several threads across the internet, so just to be clear, I'm putting this disclaimer here.[/color]**
  
  
This mod is a collection of exploit fixes for the Vanilla game.
  
  
**1. Follower Favor Exploit Fixes**
  
  
This fix was formerly known as "Follower Favor Carry Limit". From v1.2.11 onwards, this has been expanded to "Follower Favor Exploit Fixes" and adresses some additional exploits related to the Follower favor Mode:
  
  
This requires [SPID](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869) to dynamically apply to any and all relevant NPCs in your load order.
  
  
**Follower Carry Weight Exploit**
  
  
When having followers pick up objects, they could pick up items even if they were over their carry capacity, without downsides. This could be exploited to fill them with an infinite amount of items
  
  
I changed it so they drop any items that would put them over the limit.
  
  
**Duplicate Item Exploit**
  
  
When having followers pick up objects, these objects weren't always properly unloaded. As such, leaving and re-entering the cell would make the objects reappear. This has been fixed, so items are properly moved to the followers inventory. Also works with the previous fix.
  
  
This tweak also prevents followers from picking up items that are marked as non-playable. (like the giant's club)
  
  
**Looting Containers Removes Object Ownership Exploit**
  
  
If you put an owned item in an unowned container and let a follower loot said container, it would remove ownership on that item. I simply blocking followers from looting containers, as it is prone to many other glitches.
  
  
**Picking Locks Without Requirements Exploit**
  
  
If you let a follower pick a lock, they did not require any lockpicks and the lock's level didn't always take into account the followers lockpicking level.
  
  
I've scripted a new system from scratch, which has your follower require a certain level in lockpicking depending on the lock level. But they will still need lockpicks and may break several in order to open the lock. The higher level they are in lockpicking, the less locks they will break.
  
  
**2. Player Grab Stealing**Spoiler~~Grabbing an owned item (Z-keying) will count as stealing. (like in Oblivion) This is done to avoid dragging an owned item to a hidden place in order to steal it there.
  
  
In addition, I removed a buggy Vanilla mechanic, which is described in [this topic](https://www.afkmods.com/index.php?/topic/4393-curious-design-descions-helgas-bunkhouse/) because it was interfering with my tweak.
  
  
Dragging an item will also break invisibility now.~~
  
  
This tweak has been made obsolete with [powerofthree's Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51073), which fixes this on a native level, and as such is much cleaner and less prone to complications.
  
  
I'm keeping this tweak up for reference, as it may proof useful to other mod authors for other purposes. I wouldn't recommend this for users; since the mod linked above is much better in that regard.
  
**3. Grabbing Mode Exploit Fixes**
  
  
Following items will cause damage to NPCs when you drop them on an NPCs (un-Zkey): Buckets, baskets, cast iron pots, kettles, dwarven bowls. The damage will make the NPC enter combat and/or give you a bounty.
  
This is done to fix the "bucket head" exploit.
  
  
Now also prevents clipping though walls using plates. When attempted, the player will ragdoll and drop the item.
  
  
**4. Don't Read Elder Scrolls While Swimming**
  
  
This small tweak prevents you from reading an Elder Scroll while swimming, as that was causing an animation glitch. Also applies to Black Books.
  
  
This conflicts with [USMP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50813). As such let the scripts of this module override USMP.
  
  
**5. Horse Exploit Fixes**
  
  
When you're now riding a horse on a slope with an angle of 40 degrees or more (in either direction), you'll fall off your horse.
  
This is done to prevent the exploit of horses running up very steep slopes.
  
  
You can assign different values for the slope angle threshold, by using these console commands:
  
  
Spoiler
  

```
set ANDR_HEF_ThresholdAngleX to X
```

  
(40 by default)
  
  

```
set ANDR_HEF_ThresholdAngleX_Neg to X
```

  
(-40 by default)
  
  
You can also customise the polling rate, by using this console command:
  
  

```
set ANDR_HEF_UpdateInterval to X
```

  
X in time in seconds, default is 2. If set to 0, the polling effect will be disabled. The polling only occurs when on riding a horse. It shouldn't leave any harmful script effects. If you're uncertain, you can increase the polling amount, or set it to 0 to disable it.
  
  
  
In addition to this, I used a workaround to fix another animation glitch, when mounting/dismounting a horse while swimming, would prevent the horse from using swimming animations and "sprinting" through the water.
  
  
So, if you now mount/dismount a horse while swimming, it will use proper swimming animations.
  
  
Note: There may a short delay for the animations of the player and/or horse to catch up, after dismounting/mounting while swimming.
  
  
**6. No Casting While Fast Travelling**
  
  
Previously called Telekinesis XP exploit fix before v1.2.7.
  
  
~~Fixes he exploit mentioned in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbbq8RHzHEc).
  
  
Basically, by using the Telekinesis spell, combined with the Secret of Arcana Power from the Dragonborn DLC, you could then fast travel to a far away location and instantly get level 100 in Alteration. This fix disables Fast Travel, as long as you are casting Telekinesis.~~
  
  
As of 1.2.7, it has been remade from scratch. It now interrupts all spells that were being cast, when fast travelling.
  
  
**7. Standing Stones Balance and Exploit Fixes**
  
  
Standing Stones that have a "once a day power" (Serpent, Ritual, Shadow and Tower), now have a shared cooldown of 28,800 in game seconds. This effect persists when unequipping and re-equipping the Aetherial Crown.
  
  
Note: This is done to fix the exploit in which you can just unequip and re-equip the Aetherial Crown to get unlimited uses.
  
  
Ritual Stone:
  
  
- Added Conjuration as school and added proper keywords for raising undead, so it will benefit from the Conjuration tree and perks, just like other spells of that school.
  
- Reduced max amount of raised creatures to a maximum of 10 (down from a 100.), depending on your level in Conjuration:
  
  

  
* Less than level 10: max of 1 undead.
level 10-19: max of 2 undead.
  
* level 20-29: max of 3 undead.
level 30-39: max of 4 undead.
  
* level 40-49: max of 5 undead.
level 50-59: max of 6 undead.
  
* level 60-69: max of 7 undead.
level 70-79: max of 8 undead.
  
* level 80-89: max of 9 undead.
level 90 and up: max of 10 undead.
  

  
- Reduced the range of the AoE.
  
- Reduced duration of spell to 60 seconds. (down from 200 seconds.)
  
- When the effect ends, the raised dead will turn to ash, so they can't be re-raised as undead.
  
  
Note: This stone was broken and way too easily used for exploits. The way the stone is now is still pretty powerful, as no Conjuration spell even allows for 10 raised undead at the same time, and the Ritual Stone power can be acquired at level 1.
  
  
In v1.2.6, I adressed more exploits by doing the following:
  

  
* The Aetherial Crown no longer stores an effect, instead, it allows you to activate a second stone if you already have one active.
Unequipping the Aetherial Crown removes ALL of your standing stones.
  

  
**8. Skuldafn - Skip Dragon Priest Exploit Fix**
  
  
At the end of [Skuldafn](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Skuldafn), it was possible to run past the Dragon Priest, [Nahkriin](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Nahkriin_(creature)), into Sovngarde, skipping the fight with him completely. The portal to Sovngarde is open by default, so I set it closed as default and added the staff to Nahkriin, so you'll have to kill him to get the staff, in order to open the portal.
  
  
I also altered the terrain of Skuldafn a bit to prevent an exploit to skipping to the end of the dungeon.
  
  
**9. Salmon Roe - Rebalanced**
  
  
The waterbreathing effect on the [Salmon Roe](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Salmon_Roe) ingredient has a duration of 60, which is 12 times the value of the same effect on other ingredients, while its Fortify Magicka effect only has a duration 5 seconds. (normally 60 seconds).
  
  
I changed the Fortify Magicka's duration to 60 seconds and the Waterbreathing's effect duration to 10, which is double than the default value, as I still wanted it to stand out, but not by too much.
  
  
Note: I am aware that USSEP used to fix this, but they removed it, since they no longer considered it a fix. I however, do still consider it a fix.
  
**10. Paralysis Exploit Fixes**
  
  
This fix was formerly known as "Paralysis Fall Exploit Fix". From v1.2.11 onwards, this has been remade from scratch to cover more exploits related to Paralysis.
  
  
It used to do this:
  
  
Spoiler
  
Adds a condition on the Paralysis alchemy effect, so it will no longer work when falling down.
  
  
The following ingredients has the [Paralysis](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Paralyze_(effect)) effect as 1st effect, which makes eating it cause paralysis: [Netch Jelly](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Netch_Jelly), [Gold Kanet](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Gold_Kanet) and [Corkbulb Root](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Corkbulb_Root). If you eat them while falling down, you can exploit this to receive no falling damage. This fix prevents that from happening.
  
  
This has been removed and replaced with a completely reworked fix.
  
  
Instead of applying a buggy hardcoded Vanilla effect, changed it to a new scripted effect, which is more cooperating with the havok engine. You will still take fall damage and you should longer clip through objects.
  
  
In addition, the player and NPCs are now able to resist Paralysis. This compares the caster's Alteration level to a resistance value that scales with the target's Alteration, Magic Resist and Stamina.
  
  
There's a patch available for fix 20: "Harmful Utility Spells Deal Damage".
  
  
**11. Torch Sheathing Drawing Sneaking Sprinting Exploit Fixes**
  
  
Wielding a torch while sprinting allowed you to have unlimited sprint, by spamming the sprinting button while having a torch out.
  
In addition, drawing a weapon/torch while sneaking or sprinting would mess up the speed of sprinting/sneaking.
  
  
As such, to prevent these exploits, I made the following tweaks:
  

  
* I disabled sprinting and sneaking while wielding a torch.
When sprinting/sneaking (moving) you can no longer draw or sheathe weapons.
  
* When sprinting/sneaking (moving) and equiping a torch, this will bring you to a halt and make you exit sprinting/sneaking. (Note: Sometimes the torch may be held strangely after being equipped mid-sprint. Simply re-equip to fix that.)

  
**12. Food Exploit Fixes**
  
  
This module changes the Restore Health/Stamina effect on food, that has a longer duration. The way the stamina effect works, it makes you have an infinite source of stamina.I changed these effects to Regenerate Health/Stamina instead, which just increases your existing health/stamina regenerating.
  
  
**13. Sneak Rebalanced**
  
  
In Vanilla, Sneak was heavily overpowered, given birth to the "stealth archer" meme. For this reason, I decided to decrease sneak damage, while still being quite powerful, just not as broken as Vanilla.
  
  
Spoiler
  
  
**Sneaking XP AFK**
  
  
You no longer get sneak XP for simply sneaking, since that was exploitable through just running in a wall and going AFK. To get XP you'll need to perform sneak attacks.
  
  
**Significantly decreased base sneak damage**
  
  

* Crossbow: 2x -> 1.100x
Bow: 2x -> 1.125x
  
* Battleaxe: 2x -> 1.300x
Greatsword: 2x -> 1.400x
  
* Waraxe: 3x -> 1.600x
Mace: 3x -> 1.650x
  
* Sword: 3x -> 1.700x
Unarmed: 2x -> 1.900x
  
* Dagger: 3x -> 2.000x

  
**Changes to perks**
  
  

  
* Backstab: "Sneak attacks with one-handed weapons now do six times damage." **changed to** "Sneak attacks with unarmed and one-handed weapons (excluding daggers) deal an additional 25% damage. Sneak attacks with two-handed weapons deal an additional 10% damage."
Deadly Aim: "Sneak attacks with bows now do three times damage." **changed to** "Sneak attacks with bows deal 20% more damage. Sneak attacks with crossbows deal 10% more damage."
  
* Assassin's Blade: "Sneak attacks with daggers now do a total of fifteen times normal damage." **changed to** "Sneak attacks with daggers deal 0.5% more damage per level in Sneak. (capped at 100% more damage at level 200 in Sneak)" (note: to get level 200 in Sneak, you'll need the [Skill Uncapper](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8889), otherwise this perk will be capped at 50% more damage at level 100 in Sneak.)
Shadow Warrior: added a 60 second cooldown to prevent spamming it.
  

**Sneak detection scaling**
  
  
At level 100 in Sneak, you were virtually invisible. With this tweak, you'll still be difficult to detect, but not as invisible.
  
  
**Orc Berserker Racial**
  
  
I made the Berserk Orc racial no longer work while sneaking.
  
  
**Backstab enchantment on Dark Brotherhood gloves**
  
  
By default, all Dark Brotherhood gloves double sneak attack damage (100% extra sneak damage). I decreased those, but gave every type of gloves a different amount.
  
  

  
* Shrouded Handwraps: 5% extra sneak damage
Shrouded Gloves: 7.5% extra sneak damage
  
* Jester's Gloves: 10% extra sneak damage
Cicero's Gloves: 12% extra sneak damage
  
* Ancient Shrouded Gloves: 15% extra sneak damage

  
**Muffle Spell**
  
  
This spell was an unlimited source of Illusion XP and a free boost to Sneak effectiveness. As such, I changed the following:
  

  
* Decreased the XP gained from it.
To recast the spell, the last cast must have been expired, so it won't stack.
  
* Reduced the magnitude, so it won't grant 100% noise reduction, like in Vanilla.
Reduced the duration of the spell to a base of 60 seconds.
  
* Adressed all similar effects for enchantments and perks.

  
**Invisibility Spell**
  
  
Similar to Muffle, Invisibility was too great of a boost to Sneak effectiveness. As such, I changed the following:
  

  
* To recast the spell, the last cast must have been expired, so it won't stack.
Reduced the duration of the spell to a base of 60 seconds.
  
* Adressed all similar effects for enchantments, potions and perks.

  
**Decreased sneak damage when enemies are searching for you**
  
  
If any enemy is searching for you, you will deal 50% less sneak damage.
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
  
This module might be incompatible with several mods, most likely perk mods, but likely others as well.
  
  
  
  
**14. No Quest Items on Weapon Racks**
  
  
Blocks quest items to be mounted on a weapon rack.
  
  
Requires [USSEP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266) and [powerofthree's Papyrus Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22854)
  
  
I've added a patch for this and [Immersive Display Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70508).
  
  
**15. Block Pickpocketing on Exploitable Targets**
  
  
Blocks pickpocketing and reverse-pickpocketing on several scripted NPCs, in order to prevent exploiting getting infinite XP without any risks.
  
  
Currently included:
  

  
* [Sibbi Black-Briar](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Sibbi_Black-Briar)
[Astrid](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Astrid) (during [With Friends Like These...](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:With_Friends_Like_These...))
  
* [Fulltheim the Fearless](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Fultheim_the_Fearless) (during [With Friends Like These...](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:With_Friends_Like_These...))
 (during [With Friends Like These...](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:With_Friends_Like_These...))
  
* [Vasha](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Vasha) (during [With Friends Like These...](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:With_Friends_Like_These...))

  
From v1.0a, this also includes any NPCs that are in the TGNoPickpocketFaction.
  
  
**16. Attacking Friendlies To Get XP Exploit Fix**
  
  
Makes certain friendly NPCs aggressive if you attack them, in order to prevent attacking them to get infinite XP.
  
  
NPCs covered:
  
  

  
* [Shadowmere](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Shadowmere)
[Ralof](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ralof)
  
* [Hadvar](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Hadvar)
[The 4 Greybeards](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Greybeards)
  
* [Paarthurnax](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Paarthurnax_(dragon))

  
**17. Greybeards Immune to Paralysis**
  
  
This tweak makes [the 4 Greybeards](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Greybeards) immune to paralysis, to avoid messing up their AI when using Whirlwind Sprint.
  
  
**18. No Jumping While Swimming or Sneaking**
  
  
Disables jumping while swimming or sneaking to prevent some animation related exploits.
  
  
**19. Jail Armor Stacking Exploit Fix**
  
  
Fixes the exploit where armor can be stacked by abusing the jail system. The exploit is exposed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWGmd9bKWOY).
  
  
After you serve your time, all armor and weapons will be unequipped, except for Ragged Robes and Boots.
  
  
Note: You'll need [Engine Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17230) for this, or you might risk a CTD, since UnequipAll() sometimes causes that.
  
  
**20. Harmful Utility Spells Deal Damage**
  
  
Soul Trap, Paralysis and Raise Undead spells will deal a small amount of damage. This will cause aggro when casting them on friendly targets, to prevent exploiting spam-casting this on friendly targets to gain xp.
  
**21. Thalmor Embassy - No Trees to Exploit**
  
  
Outside the Thalmor Embassy were several trees that could be exploited to get over the walls of the Thalmor Embassy, outside the relevant quest. This plugin changes the trees to bushes instead, to prevent that.
  
  
**22. Speech Exploit Fix**
  
  
There was an exploit with the [Black Star](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Black_Star) quest, in which you were able to persuade/intimidate/bribe [Nelacar](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Nelacar) and immediately cancel to repeat getting speech experience an unlimited amount of times. The fix prevents that.
  
  
**23. Magic Anomalies Dont Fill Soul Gems**
  
  
[Magic Anomalies](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Magic_Anomaly) level with the player at a rate of 1.75 per level. In addition, they spawn infinitely at the [final fight of the College of Winterhold](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Eye_of_Magnus). (and the [Aftershock](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Aftershock)  radiant quests afterwards.) This could be exploited to fill an unlimited amount of grand soul gems at a relatively low level. As such, I excluded Magic Anomalies from being able to be soul trapped.
  
  
**24. Konahriks Mask Gives no EXP**
  
  
[Konahriik's Mask](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Konahrik) has a chance to have it's wearer cast certain spells when on low health.
  
These spells were the same that would be normally cast, when learned through a spell tome.
  
This resulted in getting skill exp when they were cast. As this could be exploited, I changed the spells used for Konahriik to versions that grant no skill exp.
  
  
**25. No Backwards Power Attacks While Sneaking**
  
  
When performing a backwards power attack while sneaking, you could clip through walls behind you.
  
As such, I disabled backwards power attacks while sneaking.
  
  
**26. Alternate Forms Exploit Fixes**
  
  
This prevents any menus (except for the perk menu) to open while in Werewolf or Vampire Lord form. Additionally, it unequips any weapon or armor that gets equipped while being a Werewolf or Vampire Lord.
  
  
This is to prevent the (in)famous exploit to equip weapons and armor your current race (Werewolf or Vampire Lord) does not have slots for, essentially allowing to equip an infinite amount of enchanted gear and as such infinitely stacking enchantments. (as well as a variant on the resto loop, where you'd get the enchantment bonus from items that aren't actually equipped.)
  
  
This is not compatible with my other mod: [Alternate Forms Keep Armor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/123204/)﻿.
  
  
**27. Helgen Tower Exploit Fix**
  
  
This fix prevents the player from exploiting Helgen Tower's collision to run around the walls and skip the intro sequence.
  
In addition, it moves the COCMarker in Helgen Keep to the entrance.
  
  
**28. Abandoned Shack Navmesh Fix**
  
  
If you choose to attack [Astrid](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Abandoned_Shack) in the [Abandoned Shack](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Astrid), there's a spot behind the bed that had no navmesh, which could be exploited to attack Astrid with ranged weapons.
  
This fix adresses that.
  
  
**29. Power Attacks Require More Than 1 Stamina**
  
  
In Vanilla, power attacks cost a certain amount of stamina, however, they only require 1 stamina to be used. The game will not prevent you from using them, as long as you have at least 1 stamina. This can be exploited with foods that constantly heal stamina over time.
  
  
As such, I gave all power attacks a larger stamina requirement. By default it's 40, but you can change it using console commands:
  
  
Spoiler

```
set ANDR_PARMT1S_StaminaReqGlobal to X
```

  
X is the amount of stamina required. By default, X is 40.
  
  
  
**30. Harkon Load Dummy Exploit Fix**
  
  
In Castle Volkihar, there's a dummy NPC called [Load Dummy](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Unused_Creatures#Load_Dummy). Essentially, it's a clone of Harkon that makes it easier for him to load.
  
  
However, this NPC could be exploited to get your own raised Harkon (through Raise Zombie spells). I've given him certain keywords and factions to prevent that.
  
  
**31. Fethis Alor - EECO Pendant Exploit Fix**
  
  
If you deliver East Empire Pendants to [Fethis Alor](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Fethis_Alor), he will always pay you, regardless of having any gold in his shop inventory.
  
  
I changed it, so he can only pay you, if he has enough gold in his shop inventory and the payment will directly come from this shop inventory.
  
  
**32. Mora's Grasp Fix**
  
  
Due to missing conditions, the [Mora's Grasp](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Powers#Mora.27s_Grasp) spell had an unintentional side-effect of incorrectly removing "AI disabled", "ghost" or "activation blocked" states on references. This could be exploited.
  
  
I added certain conditions to prevent this from happening.
  
  
**33. Sitting Conditions**
  
  
In Vanilla, when you sit on a chair, when in first person with having weapons/spells drawn, you'd end up in a bugged state, which has you clip through objects.
  
  
To prevent this, I blocked sitting on chair or other furniture when moving or having weapons/spells drawn.
  
  
**34. Dawnguard Rune Shield Fix**
  
  
The [Dawnguard Rune Shield](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dawnguard_Rune_Shield) casts a Sun Shield while blocking, which costs Stamina. However, you'd only need at least 1 point of stamina.
  
  
It suffers from the same issue as power attacks: When you use food that restores stamina over time, like Vegetable Soup, you'll be able to hold up the shield indefinitely.
  
  
I fixed this exploit by increasing the required stamina from 1 to 15 points.
  
  
**35. Greybeards Whirlwind Skip Exploit Fix**
  
  
When going to the Greybeards for the first time in the main quest ([The Way of the Voice](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Way_of_the_Voice)), you learn to use the Whirlwind Sprint. To practice this, the Greybeards will have you use the shout to go through a door that closes fast.
  
  
However, it doesn't close fast enough for the player to use their regular sprint to get through. I fixed this, so the player actually need to use the Whirlwind Sprint shout to preceed the quest.
  
  
**36. Green Thumb Perk Fix**
  
  
The [Green Thumb](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Alchemy#Green_Thumb) perk has you gather 2 ingredients from plants. However, this also applies to any other types of what the game considers "flora", like gold purses. As such, you'd get double gold from gold purses.
  
  
I fixed this by adding a condition to the perk that limits it to actual plants only.
  
  
  
**37. Reflect Blows Perk Fix**
  
  
The [Reflect Blows](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Heavy_Armor#Reflect_Blows) perk has you reflect damage "while wearing all Heavy Armor: head, chest, hands, feet." However, due to to poor conditions, you can actually get this benefit without wearing armor that isn't considered heavy armor.
  
  
I fixed this by changing the conditions to have actual heavy armor required.
  
  
**38. Necromage Perk Revamped**
  
  
The [Necromage](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Restoration#Necromage) perk when player is a vampire, would affect many different effects that aren't considered spells, like enchantments, potion effects, permanent buffs, perks, etc.
  
  
I changed it to have it still apply the player themself if they're a Vampire, however, I limited it to actual spells, that are learned from spell tomes.
  
  
USSEP changes this to not have it affect the player, but that makes it useless when NPCs have the perk and uses spells against the player.
  
  
There are actually NPCs called "Necromage". I distributed this perk among those. (requires [SPID](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869).)
  
  
**39. Ash Shell Fix**
  
  
Due to missing conditions, the [Ash Shell](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Ash_Shell) spell had an unintentional side-effect of incorrectly removing the "ghost" flag on references. This could be exploited.
  
  
I added certain conditions to prevent this from happening.
  
  
**40. Reach Abandonned Boat - No Loot Respawn**
  
  
In the Reach, at the side of a river near the mountain that contains Skyhaven temple, there's an adandonned boat with several gems lying around.
  
  
They are set to respawn and as such are an infinite source to repeatably farm these gems. This could be exploited. As such, I set them to no longer respawn.
  
  
**41. Ahzidals Ring of Necromancy - Script Fix**
  
  
Instead of properly killing any undead in a forty explosion, Ahzidal's Ring actually always dealt 10,000 points of damage.
  
  
If enemies have larger health pools, this could be exploited. As such, I changed it to properly kill them.
  
  
**42. Marriage Scene Ending Fixes**
  
  
At a certain point during the wedding quest, the players controls will be locked to initiate the wedding scene. These controls will be re-enabled after this scene.
  
  
However, the command to re-enable them will also happen if you fail the quest, which will undo any other instance where locking controls might be required.
  
  
Needless to say, this can be exploited to break through disabled controls. As such, I added conditions to prevent this from happening.
  
  
**43. Magelight Experience Exploit Fix**
  
  
Requires [SkyPatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106659).
  
  
If you cast the Magelight spell at certain spots where they can reach very far, like outside Solitude in the mountains. This would give you immense amounts of experience in Alteration, which could be exploited.
  
  
As such, I limited any experience gains from using the spell that way.
  
  
**44. Duplicate Bloodskal Blade Removed**
  
  
There's one duplicate of the [Bloodskal Blade](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Bloodskal_Blade) lying around in [Bloodskal Barrow](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Bloodskal_Barrow), which I removed.
  
  
**45. Mind of Madness Fixes**
  
  
The NPCs in the [Mind of Madness](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Mind_of_Madness) had some missing failsafe factions and keywords. As such I added them.
  
  
**46. Trainers Gold Reclaim Fix**
  
  
When paying trainers to train you, all of the gold you paid them will be added to their inventory, which can be pickpocketed back, or even just transfered back when they're your follower.
  
  
USSEP actually adresses this for a select few followers. However, this can still be exploited through pickpocket.
  
  
As such, I used a more throughout method that will also take those into account.
  
  
Credit to Daemonjax for their LE mod: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/8627 I expanded this mod, so it only affects gold added to NPCs inventories through training and I've added some additional features.
  
  
As I do like certain aspects of pickpocketing the gold back, I added the option to determine the percentage of gold that will be added to the NPCs inventory while training.
  
  
You can change it by using the following console command:
  
  

```
set EF_GLOB_GoldRemovedPercent to X
```

  
  
X is the percentage of gold from training, that will be removed. (default value is 100.) For instance, if the training costs 200 gold and the value is set at 75, 150 gold will be removed. This value is clamped between 0 and 100.

~~Certain users were having issues loading this mod with the latest version of [USSEP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266). If you're having issues loading some of my tweaks (crashing the game on startup), try using [Backported Extended ESL Support](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441).~~ As this mod requires [USSEP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266), make sure you have the correct version of it to match your game.
  
**[b][color=#a4c2f4]FAQ**[/b][/color]
  
  
Q: ESPFE?
  
A: Yes.
  
  
Q: "Why even "fix" these "exploits"? "
  
A: "I share them for people that are interested in them, and requested them. (Yes, people actually did.) If they're not your cup of tea, that's perfectly fine. Just don't download them, and move along silently, please."
  
  
Q: Why don't you just don't use exploits, instead of "fixing" them?
  
A: To me, personally, telling me to "just don't do X" while still being able to do so in game, doesn't make any sense. Same applies to "self-restraint". In this case, why should I have to limit/restrain myself, if exploits allow for it?
  
In TTRPG terms, it would be like being both DM and player at the same time, which has been proven again and again to not create any fun experiences. In case of Modrim, the game and its mods should be the DM and arbit the player.
  
The moment I enter the game, I don't want to think about restricting myself artificially, while the game still allows for it. I want the game (through mods) to restrict me, instead of the other way around.
  
"When players need to arbit themselves to enjoy (or even prevent breaking) a game, said game has failed."
  
  
Q: Why did you release all these tweaks seperate? Can't you just put them in a pack?
  
A: They used to be in a pack called Andrealphus' Gameplay Tweaks. (which is now named [Andrealphus' Tweaks - Harder Quests](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27939))
  
  
However, since the title wasn't descriptive enough, many people were having issues finding a particular tweak. That mod was just a bag of random things, because I never really thought about packaging it up for the public. I was just playing around with it, releasing them as I made them. However, I want to make all of the tweaks to be easier to find by the public, and as such decided to seperate them and give them better descriptive names.
  
For instance, if someone was looking for a mod to feed rabbits, they couldn't find the tweak that I made, since it was part of "Andrealphus Gameplay Tweaks". However, now I hope it's easier to find them. My apologies for any inconvenience.
  
  
As for a pack. They're all flagged as ESLs, so they don't count towards the plugin limit. You can merge them yourself if you want, but I won't be merging
  
them, since it's too cumbersome to keep both a seperate and merged version up, not too mention updating them at that point.
  
  
I also won't be putting them into a FOMOD, since that would require to re-upload all of them everytime I make a minor update. My internet is limited unfortunately, with monthly caps, so uploading them all just to make a minor change is quite harmful for me.
  
  
Q: Does installing/updating/uninstalling on an existing save work?
  
A: As far as I know, it should. However, it's good practice to keep a backup save prior to doing this, just in case.
  
  
Q: Is this compatible with <insert mod>?
  
A: I don't know by heart. You might need to check yourself.
  
  
Q: Will you make a patch for <insert mod>?
  
A: Only if it's a mod I use myself or plan on using, I have enough time and I actually like the idea. Otherwise, feel free to do it yourself. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: I have a suggestion to improve the mod. Can you do it?
  
A: Maybe, if I have time and I like the idea, I'll consider it.
  
  
Q: Will you port this to <insert platform>?
  
A: No, I myself only support the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If someone else wants to port it, feel free. (see permission) If you decide to port it, you yourself take full responsibility to offer support to said port. I will not provide no support for any ports by third parties.
  
  
Q: I use a ported version of this mod on <insert platform> and I have a problem. Can you help?
  
A: I don't provide any support for third party ports on other platforms than the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If you have issues, you should adress the person that ported it.
  
  
Q: Does this work on Skyrim 1.6+, aka "Anniversary Edition"?
  
A: Yes, it should.
  
  
Q: Why don't your mods use MCMs and instead use this janky console command system to set globals?
  
A: I am not a fan of MCMs. You can set the globals by making a patch in xEdit. I have no plans of changing this. If you want to add an MCM, feel free. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: Why don't you use FOMODs?
  
A: ~~That would require reuploading the entire mod, in question, even if I only make a small change. My internet is limited and reuploading the files each time will take a huge chunk of my monthly volume.~~ Given the amount of modules within this mod and the relative small filesize of all of the modules combined, I've made an exception for this mod.
