**Hunters Not Bandits aims to fix one of my biggest pet peeves.**

That NPC’s use the same taunts when hunting & fighting animals
  
 as bandits do to you.
  
  
**Version 3 and later** fixes Skyrims “amazing” dialogues,
  
where enemies could say things like:
  
  
**“Can I help you?”,** *right after they kill you.*
  
  
**Version 4 and later is ESL** and fixes the intro scene
  
to the Psijic order in Saarthal, so it
  
always plays out correctly.

Hunters and other NPC’s will now behave in a way you would expect them to.
  
  
They will take out their bow silently without going **Huh, what was that?** 
  
or scream **This is your last mistake!** followed by **Skyrim is for the Nords!**
  
  
Approaching their prey in a way that doesn’t alert the whole world to their presence.
  
  
This is what the mod aims to fix, this is the reason for its name.
  
  
  
*Dialogue which adds a bit of flavor while still making sense is left alone.
  
I don’t want to remove too much and turn them into lifeless robots.
  
  
Speaking of which, characters will only tone down their chattiness when it comes to animals. They will be just as verbal when dealing with others as they where before.*
  
  
  
  
  
**4.0****It’s been FIVE years since the last update.**
  
Reason? Because it really doesn’t need one.
  
  
 At least that’s what I thought.
  
  
  
During the development of Jay Serpa’s wonderful [College of Winterhold - Quest Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66666) 
  
I was reminded of an old Skyrim bug which has never been fixed. One which happens to be located among the dialogues that Hunters Not Bandits deals with.
  
  
What happens if you stand on top of the spot where the psijic monk Nerien spawns in Saarthal is that he may for a brief moment use his regular High Elf lines before the game cinematically fades the lights and the scene kicks in.
  
  
  
It doesn’t help that the regular High Elf lines have a very different pitch and tone from the lines in the scene, warning the player of things to come.
  
  
You can get gems like:
  
  
**Those are College of Winterhold robes, aren’t they?**
  
  
...said mockingly which transitions to a totally different, much more serious voice telling you:
  
  
 **HOLD, MAGE, AND LISTEN WELL...**
  
  
in the fraction of a second is not the best way to introduce the most powerful mage organization in the setting.
  
  
  
  
  
**Installation**
  
*Preferably use a mod manager to install.* 
  
  
  
  
  
**Load Order**
  
Hunters Not Bandits works best if placed after any mods like [Relationship Dialogue Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1187) and [Guard Dialogue Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22075) which change dialogues.
  
  
  
[Immersive Citizens](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/173/?) and Hunters Not Bandits have a bit of crossover because they both edit some of the same taunts, Immersive Citizens only covers creatures considered prey, like rabbits and deer but not any hostile animals.
  
  
Letting HNB handle those dialogues by placing it after Immersive Citizens (if installed), gets you the benefit of both mods.
  
  
  
  
  
**Upgrading**
  
Simply overwrite your existing version with the new one.
  
  
  
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
A mod adding new animals to the world only needs to make sure that they are properly keyworded with ActorTypeAnimal (just like the animals in the regular game) and Hunters Not Bandits will take care of the rest.
