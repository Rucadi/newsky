**What does the patch do?**

  
  
The Unofficial Skyrim Creation Club Content Patch applies Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch (USSEP) fixes to [Creation Club content](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Creation_Club) where necessary and also fixes new bugs introduced by the Creation Club mods.
  
  
  

**How do I install this mod?**

  
  
I recommend using either the Vortex, Mod Organizer 2 or Wrye Bash mod managers. For Vortex and Mod Organizer 2, attempting to install this mod will automatically bring up an installer. If you are using Wrye Bash, right-click on the mod in your Install tab and choose Wizard to begin the installation process. Then select which patches you would like to apply.
  
  
  

**Where can I find a list of the bugs this fixes?**

  
  
The list of bugs fixed can be accessed under the Logs tab in the changelog dropdown. This will show the bugs fixed with each version of the mod.
  
  
  

**What languages is this mod available in?**

  
  
This mod is localized, meaning that translations will appear correctly in English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Polish and Russian without needing separate versions. You don't need a separate download to support any of these languages.[/font]
