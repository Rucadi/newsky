I was playing the M'rissi's Tails of Troubles , when i got to the mission where you help M'rissi raise the black cat Lirry , after finding food for the cat the second time the game will crash every time you try to leave the area which causes Lirry to unload. it will also CTD when M'rissi try to pick up the kitten in the cave. this mod should fix those problems.
