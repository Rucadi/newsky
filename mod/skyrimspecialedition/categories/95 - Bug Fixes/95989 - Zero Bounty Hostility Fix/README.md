> Skyrim mod fixes bug that causes guards to randomly attack innocent players [right]-- [GfinityESports](https://www.gfinityesports.com/gaming-news/skyrim-mod-guards-attack-innocent-players-bug-fix/)[/right]

**Description**
  

  
* Sometimes guards and citizens remain hostile to the player even if the player has 0 bounty. I think they will eventually calm down.
This mod attempts to remove hostility when you have 0 bounty for the relevant crime factions.
  
* This mod works only for vanilla holds and Ravenrock.
**Fix is applied on location change. So if you encounter this, you can run away across a load door and travel back.**
  
* Doesn't apply to factions without a bounty system, such as Telvanni or Thieves Guild.
Allows you to go to jail.
  
* To enable this for mod-added crime factions, add the new crime fractions to the form list in the esp.
This bug is very hard to reproduce. Please let me know if it works for all occurrences involving the vanilla holds.
  
* ESL

  
**Installation/Uninstallation/Update**
  

  
* Whenever. Doesn't matter.

(This mod doesn't make your Skyrim 4K ultra HD nor does it enable ray-tracing)
