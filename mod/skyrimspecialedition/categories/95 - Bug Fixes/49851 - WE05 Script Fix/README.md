# WE05 Script Fix

While traveling around the Reach, you might meet small groups of clueless Forsworn or Orc Hunters, seemingly asking themselves "What the f\*\*\* am I doing here?"
  
They're leftovers from the *WE05 "Orcs Fighting Forsworn"* quest, standing around without an AI because the quest has stopped.
  
Besides being ridiculous, they also generate some unwelcome save bloating.
  
This removes them when they're no longer needed, like any other "Wilderness Encounters" quest does with its spawned references.
  
Unfortunately, only the ones generated after having installed the fix can be deleted.
