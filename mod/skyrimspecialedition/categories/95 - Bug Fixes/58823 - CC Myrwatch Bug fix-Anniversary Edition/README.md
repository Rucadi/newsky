-----------------------------------------------**DESCRIPTION**---------------------------------------------------------------

  
  
This mod has the intent to fix the forgetfulness or inconsistencies left by the creator of this tower and by those of the bethesda.
  
  
Done:
  
First step: fix the structures that present problems, such as (see images) "visible" water flowing through the structure, badly placed mountains, empty spaces where you can fall and not be able to get out anymore. Make it compatible with Ussep. Modified collision boxes to avoid problems with npc
  
  
  
Not done:
  
Second step: fix the mesh of the tower and floor of the tower that presents a void. Fix/improve the lights. Fix the other clutters that I will find later (if there are any).
