# Locked Vein Activation Fix
- Author: Hydraaawr

Spamming the activation key (default: E) on any ore node while already mining causes the node to become locked, preventing further activation. The only known workaround was to leave and reenter the cell, or to activate a different ore vein before returning to the locked one. Until now!
