**Description**
  

  
* Sometimes NPCs are stuck in bleedout state with full health. They will remain like this forever until they are unloaded.
You can't talk to most of them. Healing them won't work since they are already at full health.
  
* This mod allows you to bring them out of bleedout state if they have enough health by activating them.
It also allows you to talk to them if they don't have enough health to leave bleedout.
  
* ESL.
No conflicts.
  

**Installation/Update/Uninstallation**
  

  
* Whenever doesn't matter.
