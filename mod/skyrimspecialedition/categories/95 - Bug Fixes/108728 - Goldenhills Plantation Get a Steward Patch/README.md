Ever getting stuck at hiring a steward for Goldenhills Plantation? Worry no more! This patch will get rid of the buggy check of plantation exterior area (especially true if you modify Skyrim landscape through mods). So, now a steward for Goldenhills could be hired from anywhere. While at it, it also removes the condition that the steward to be needs to be an active player follower and unmarried. Basically, you can ask [anyone that are a potential steward](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Personal_Steward) from anywhere, without the need to be an active follower, regardless of whether he/she is married to the player.
