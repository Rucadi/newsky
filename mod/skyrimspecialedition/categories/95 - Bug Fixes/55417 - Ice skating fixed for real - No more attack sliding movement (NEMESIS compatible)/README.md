**Details****[size=5]**[size=3]Finally came around fixing this vanilla atrocity. This is for all you guys not using SkySa. I actually went into the behavior files and
  
fixed ice skating at its root. It's not the same as [Reduce Attack Skating Movement](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39970)﻿ as that mod just reduces the movement speed which does little at fixing this issue (They are both compatible though). Its still a very little bit slidy on transition of walk to run, but there's nothing that can be done in vanilla to make it better than this, except replacing everything with non-vanilla animations which I don't like. This is as good as it gets for vanilla junkies. 1handed as well as 2handed are covered for both NPCs and player. Just try it out, you can ask me if you have questions. Have fun.
  
  
**[size=5]Bugs**
  
Transition from walking to running is still sliding a tad bit.
