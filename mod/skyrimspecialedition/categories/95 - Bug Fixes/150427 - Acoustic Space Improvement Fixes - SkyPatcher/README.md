**SkyPatcher & Acoustic Space Improvement Fixes**
  
  
This is a SkyPatcher addon for [Acoustic Space Improvement Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78992), a mod that corrects inconsistent acoustic templates across Skyrim’s interior cells.
  
  
In the vanilla game, many interiors—despite sharing similar layouts or models—use wildly different acoustic spaces, resulting in jarring audio transitions. [Acoustic Space Improvement Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78992) addresses this by standardizing acoustic settings across similar cell types, providing a more immersive and coherent soundscape, especially when used with mods like [Audio Overhaul for Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12466)﻿(amazing mod!) or [Reverb Interior Sounds Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77947)﻿ (a must have!).
  
  
This [SkyPatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106659) addon automatically ensures those changes persist in your load order, even when other mods overwrite the same CELL records. It's a lightweight, conflict-free solution that makes sure your interiors sound exactly as they should.
  
  
Just install and enjoy improved consistency in your interior acoustics.
