This is a problem that has been bothering me for six months. Every time I fast travel from the stables in Whiterun  to other places, or from other places to Whiterun, there is a certain chance that the game will crash, which is very annoying. After a long process of investigation, I discovered the culprit, a horse born near the HaemarsShame.I don't understand why a horse can cause my game to crash. I checked in SSEEdit and there was no mod to modify horse related data. I had to try disabling the generation of this horse, and the game never crashed again.
