# Motionless Rocks Killing People Fix

**Description**
  
  
It's very likely that you encountered and even exploited this bug when already fallen motionless rocks from falling rock traps damage NPCs that bump into/try to walk through them. At the same time the player only gets damage when the rocks are actually falling or rolling on them, and even if you sprint into the rocks it's almost impossible to receive damage. This mod fixes it, so that only falling or rolling rocks damage NPCs. It doesn't fix suicidal NPCs running right under falling or rolling rocks, which still do damage.
  
  
This bug is caused by the OnTrapHitStart script event behaving differently for NPCs and the player, which, in turn, may be caused by the physical interaction between NPCs and rocks being bugged. This mod workarounds it by making the script only use the vertical velocity in calculations for NPCs. The calculations for the player are unchanged.
