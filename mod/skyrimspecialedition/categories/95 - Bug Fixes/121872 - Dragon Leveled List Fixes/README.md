The infamous dragon leveled list bug﻿, explained for normal people and nerds:
  
  
For normal people:
  
SpoilerThere are two problems:
  
  
-Bethesda screwed up and ended up just reusing one dragon's appearance for another dragon that was supposed to be unique, and also gave said dragon broken stats. It's very obvious they intended to fix this but never got around to it, and so messily worked around it.
  
-There is a missing dragon that was supposed to be added by the Dawnguard DLC, but wasn't because of going all in on a poor fix to the previously stated problem.
  
  
[USSEP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266) swooped in to save the day, but unfortunately failed because:
  
  
-The underlying problems with the broken dragon still exist, and they just plopped it right back in. They just replaced one bug with another bug, and also did not fix all aspects of the issues with the fire dragon leveled lists.
  
-They did nothing about the missing Dawnguard dragon, which actually caused another new issue.
  
  
For nerds:
  
SpoilerThere is a missing fire dragon in Skyrim that was meant to have a unique appearance. Bethesda knew this, and so created a largely broken substitute for it. (We'll call it the frankenstein dragon.) It just reuses the appearance of another fire dragon, and has wonky broken stats. Bethesda was clearly aware of this problem, because they made multiple failed attempts at fixing it.
  
  
How they fixed it was by:
  
-Swapping out the frankenstein dragon for its frost dragon equivalent, which leads to randomly seeing frost dragons where a fire dragon should be.
  
-Purposefully messing up level scaling in fire dragon lists where the frankenstein dragon is used to try and hide their mistake.
  
  
They noticed that this haphazard method of fixing caused an uneven number of the two types of dragons to spawn in leveled lists, and tried to fix it in the Dawnguard DLC, yet again failing by:
  
-Creating two inconsistent leveled list entries where you'll see only frost dragons and only fire dragons, respectively, to technically alleviate the issue of seeing uneven amounts of the two types of dragons.
  
  
There's more evidence of them failing to fix this bug in the Dragonborn DLC, since they accidentally left a placeholder NPC in a new dragon leveled list, where the frankenstein fire dragon should've been.
  
  
The [USSEP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266) team noticed this problem, and actually managed to make it even worse by:
  
-Swapping in the frankenstein dragon where it was supposed to be in vanilla, as if it's not broken.
  
-Ignoring the band-aid fix Dawnguard made to fix the issue, making it so that there is now an uneven amount of fire and frost dragons that spawn again, since Dawnguard purposefully excluded a frost dragon that the [USSEP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266) team needed to add to the game for their fix, except this time there's also a broken fire dragon thrown in as well.
  
-Making it so that you see the model the frankenstein dragon uses way too much.
  
-Making it so you will fight a dragon with broken stats much more frequently.
  
  
Using the new fire dragon model from [USSEP Frost and Fire Dragon Correction](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89648), I decided to fix this whole mess once and for all, properly, myself:
  
Spoiler-The problematic fire dragon in vanilla that used the same model as another dragon has been given the new appearance from [USSEP Frost and Fire Dragon Correction](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89648), as well all the appropriate stats and abilities it should've had in vanilla.
  
-The missing frost dragon from the Dawnguard DLC has been added to the game and incorporated appropriately.
  
-The uneven distribution of fire and frost dragons in the base game and Dragonborn DLC has been corrected. The problematic fire dragon will now show up where it's supposed to be and frost dragons will not be in its place.
  
-Fixed an oversight in Durnevhiir's and Mirmulnir's leveled lists, adding in the new fire dragons from the Dawnguard DLC.
  
-Fixed messed up level scaling in the Dawnguard Ice Lake leveled list.
  
  
[USSEP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266)﻿ only half fixes (hard to even call it a fix) this problem, hence why [USSEP Frost and Fire Dragon Correction](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89648) exists, but I made an alternative to it for a few reasons:
  
Spoiler-There's no point in adding a unique model to the missing frost dragon for the sake of bug fixing as there's no evidence it was ever meant to have a unique appearance. (In fact, there is more evidence it is actually NOT supposed to have a unique appearance.) The only real benefit of that mod would be to use the "Even More Visual Distinction" file.
  
-It makes other balance and consistency changes that aren't really bug fixes, such as restoring unused shouts.
  
-I found other bugs that it did not fix and corrected them.
  
-My mod does not require [USSEP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266)﻿.
  
  
A better mesh to match [Higher Poly Vanilla Dragons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/101093) is included on this page.
  
  
For higher resolution textures, use [this](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/101712). (I know it says it's for [USSEP Frost and Fire Dragon Correction](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89648) but it works with this too.)
  
  
[USSEP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266)﻿ is not required, this mod works completely fine with or without it.
  
  
**Note:** the new dragon does not have LOD, and so is always in full view. I strongly recommend you use some kind of patcher to remove LOD from all dragons, as it's unnecessary and ugly. Still, it's something to keep in mind.
