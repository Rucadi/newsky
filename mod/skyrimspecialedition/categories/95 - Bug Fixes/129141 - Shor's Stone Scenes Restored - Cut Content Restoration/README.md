**Details**
  
  
  
In the development of *Skyrim*, Grelka was originally meant to reside in Shor's Stone and had several voice lines recorded for this role. However, she was later moved to Riften as a merchant, leaving behind unused dialogue that never fit her new persona. Meanwhile, a new NPC, Sylgja, was created to fill Grelka’s original role in Shor’s Stone. Sylgja, with her mining background and family ties to Darkwater Crossing, embodies everything that the original Grelka was meant to represent. Yet, the recorded lines were never re-voiced for her, causing the campfire scenes to remain hidden and unplayable.
  
This mod restores those cut scenes, making them playable with Sylgja as they were always intended to be. The conversations perfectly reflect Sylgja's character, including her mining expertise, her father's influence, and her concern for her family in Darkwater Crossing, aligning with the rest of her in-game dialogue.
  
  
Restored Scenes:
  

  
1. **Grogmar and Sylgja**: A discussion about mining skills, showing admiration for Sylgja's abilities, directly reflecting her upbringing and expertise.
**Odfel and Sylgja**: An awkward attempt at courtship, highlighting Sylgja's independence and desire for a meaningful relationship.
  
2. **Filnjar and Sylgja**: A conversation about the hardships of the civil war, demonstrating Sylgja's concern for her family and the broader struggles of Skyrim.

Using AI voice synthesis, these lines are now re-voiced to match Sylgja’s established voice, ensuring seamless integration into the game while restoring the immersive experience that was always intended for Shor's Stone.
  
  
Features:

  
* **Restored dialogue**: Brings back three campfire scenes in Shor's Stone, with dialogue that aligns with Sylgja’s background and personality.
**Re-voiced lines**: Using advanced AI, Sylgja’s voice now matches the original lines meant for her, ensuring consistency with her character.
  
* **Enhanced immersion**: Adds depth to Shor’s Stone, giving life to interactions that were designed for its community but never made it into the final game.
