CWE is one of the most amazing city overhauls on the nexus. But it has also been one of the most frustrating city mods in my load order. Among those annoyances was the infinite loading bug that would happen at the eastern gate during the day. Turns out it was one of the npcs who was given a knife as a weapon. Whenever said npc (Taluri Moren) would walk out of her shack during the day, the game would struggle to place her model due to a faulty mesh.
  
  
What I have done is switching the knife out with a normal iron dagger. The bug has since stopped in my game.
  
  
**Read carefully:** ~~**﻿**If you use the high poly faces for the npcs, make sure this mod's esp is under the high poly esp in your load order, or else the changes won't happen.~~
  
 ~~﻿If you have already started the game on a save, find taluri moren and reset her inventory (resetinventory)~~
  
  
**Other fixes:**
  

  
* fixed a wall that made players fall into the infinite void at the pit exterior to the east.
Possibly fixed an issue where radiant quests would use a door that should not be accessible.
  
* Fixed the issue concerning the missing completion flag for the greystone hall home.
Blocked Benkum's unvoiced lines.
  
* corrected a typo in the elf's dialogue.
Fixed the spectator's cheer animation after killing a pit fighter.
  
* Fixed the guards not switching to imperial soldiers if windhelm is taken.
Fixed misaligned terrain to the left of the outer walls.
  
* Removed an excessive amount of pelts from the test barrel at the eastern outer wall.
Covered four gaps on the staircase to the left of the inn, which caused a glimpse into the infinite void. 
  
* Retextured the wall at the graveyard since the names at the wall kept inverting itself.
Fixed broken arches at the graveyard
  
* Attempted to fix the z fighting happening at the graveyard, it should be less flickering.
Fixed another staircase, making you see the infinite void.
  
* Removed traces of the incomplete vanilla jail arena quest that was reactivated due to huki.
