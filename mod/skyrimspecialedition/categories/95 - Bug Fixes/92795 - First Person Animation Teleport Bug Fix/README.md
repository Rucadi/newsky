When playing vanilla interaction animations while in first person, there is an annoying bug where the player gets teleported to the beginning of the cell point after their hand glitches out on the screen.
  
  
This mod fixes that teleport bug while ensuring the animations play as normal in third person, without any scripts or workarounds.
  
  
It simply just prevents the transitions from ever happening in the first place when the player is in 1st person view. It does not touch 3rd person animations at all, and it consists of a tiny Nemesis patch that should be compatible with every other behavior edit out there.
  
  
Highly recommended when using a mod like JaySerpa's [Immersive Interactions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47670), which uses a lot of interaction animations.
