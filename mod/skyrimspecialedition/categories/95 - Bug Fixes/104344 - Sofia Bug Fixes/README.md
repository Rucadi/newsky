Bug Fixes**:
  
  
-fixes husband/wife greeting dialogue to match appropriate player gender
  
  
-"Elder Knowledge" Quest dialogue fix, so she will comment on the elder scroll at the appropriate time in Tower of Mzark
  
  
-"Innocence Lost" quest dialogue fix, she will only talk comment about Grelod's death after she is killed
  
  
-"Attack on Whiterun" quest fix, Sofia will no longer get a guard AI package randomly attached to her, making her unresponsive to following
  
  
-forwards any dialogue text fixes from "Sofia - Typo Grammar and Dialogue Fixes"
  
  
-Requirements for Sofia to respond positively from telling her "you look nice" is not RNG-based now, and will require at least 10 days accompanied (it used to be 50/50 chance she'd say this after at least 7 days accompanied)
  
  
-Sofia now accepts stolen items as gifts (this is aligned with her personality)
  
  
-Fast travelling to an interior location while Sofia is on a mount will now properly teleport Sofia to you (before she would be stuck)
  
  
-Edited her hello dialogues so they don't play when you find her asleep in the stables of Whiterun (intro quest)
  
  
-intro greeting is a hello topic now, so it no longer starts with "..." when first talking to her in the barn
  
  
-reduce stickyness stuck issue  in combat (where she'll be stuck crouching)
  
  
-idle gestures for silent lines, no more mouth moving 
  
  
-properly calculates enchanted item's cost for gift giving for armors and weapons 
  
  
-converted the idle dialogues and quest commentary to not launch scenes, was causing rare bug where sofia would be stuck in a scene and never say any idles ever again
  
  
 -Fixed The Only Cure quest commentary not playing, was using House of Horrors quest completion as a condition 
  
  
- Optional patch for [House of Horrors - Quest Expansion at Skyrim Special Edition Nexus - Mods and Community](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57285)  if you choose the good ending, Sofia won't say out of context dialogue.
  
  
-Restored cut dialogue quest commentary during the Hircine Daedra quest, she'll say something if you exploited and got both rewards
  
  
-Restored cut dialogue quest commentary during the Meridia Daedra quest, she'll talk about the beacon as a "shiny ball".
