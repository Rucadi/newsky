**Requirements**
  
  
Latest version of SKSE64
  
Visual C++ Redistributables 2022
  
Address Library for SKSE Plugins
  
  
**Description**
  
  
In vanilla, you don't get XP for learning ingredient effects if you learn them by making a potion.
  
  
This plugin fixes it so you get the appropriate XP for learning ingredients AND the XP for crafting potions (whenever you craft a potion). Note that the XP for learning new ingredients in vanilla is very low - mods such as [Apothecary](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52130) will increase this.
