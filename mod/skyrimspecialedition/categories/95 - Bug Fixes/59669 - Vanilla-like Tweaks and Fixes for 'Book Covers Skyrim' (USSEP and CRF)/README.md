**Alright, these patches were created from a desire for a few things:**
  

  
1. To bring [BCS](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/901)﻿ up to date with the latest [USSEP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266)﻿ changes (including their recent widespread changes to somewhere close to half of the base-games' books to change minor capitalization issues with the various races. 'troll' --> 'Troll'; 'dwemer' --> 'Dwemer', etc.) This took a while.
Remove BCS' inclusion of several text additions from [Even Better Quest Objectives](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/159)﻿, as well as some other unnecessary text modifications I had noticed (such as adding random page breaks to several notes.)
  
2. To remove BCS' rampant changes to book/note names that were presumably made to make their name more 'consistent' but I often felt they removed some individuality from certain note names. E.g. Vanilla: 'Give Me A Chance' --> BCS: 'Note to Vex from Delvin'.
Finally, to make the inventory name of a book match what is written on the cover page. For instance, in Vanilla, the inventory title of the series The Wolf Queen is as such:'The Wolf Queen, v1', The Wolf Queen, v2', etc. However, the cover page of those books (i.e. when you actually open the book to read it) list the title as: 'The Wolf Queen, Book One', 'The Wolf Queen, Book Two', etc. In summary, whether a series is labelled as 'Book 1', 'Volume 1', 'Chapter 1', or whatever, the inventory name now matches as such.
  

  
**In essence, this patch should suit the pedant who wants books to be as 'lore friendly' (or vanilla-friendly) as possible while still sorting nicely in their inventory.**
  
**To be a bit clearer on my naming conventions..**
  
  
The vanilla name is used in every case unless it is part of a series.
  
 ﻿*E.g. 'Note' will be left as 'Note' instead of 'Note from a Forelhost Crypt Cultist'.
  
 ﻿ ﻿But 'Mythic Dawn Commentaries 3' now becomes 'Mythic Dawn Commentaries, Book 3'. (Which matches its cover page.)*
  
  
While books will use the naming convention of its cover page, journals and notes will be named with roman numerals unless the vanilla game explicitly called it a 'Volume' or a 'Part':
  
 ﻿*E.g. 'Butcher's Journal #1' becomes 'Butcher's Journal I'
  
 ﻿ ﻿However, 'Cicero's Journal - Volume 2' becomes 'Cicero's Journal, Vol. 2'.*
  
  
I think this is a good compromise between maintaining the vanilla style of things while maintaining at least SOME sort of consistency. The title of books and notes shouldn't feel like they're named as such solely to sort nicely in your inventory (but they'll surely do so).
  
  
**--Note on other mods**
  
  
I'm aware of several mods that do similar things like..
  
[Book Covers Skyrim - USSEP Update](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50615) or ﻿[Book Covers Skyrim Updated](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58376)﻿. But those were either outdated or kept the naming conventions of BCS. The latter is a full-scale replacement, which may or may not be favourable if that's what you're into.
  
  
^Those mods are unnecessary if you install my variant.
  
  
**\*\*This mod is fully compatible with the CCOR, CACO & 'The Choice Is Yours' patches found on [kryptopyr's Patch Hub](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19518). Please make sure to load those files after my main plugin file to ensure their changes aren't overwritten.\*\***
