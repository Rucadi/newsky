**Details**[left]This mod provides a comprehensive fix for the hammering animations in Skyrim, specifically when NPCs or the player character are working on wooden walls and ship masts. The default animation had several immersion-breaking issues, including incorrect sound effects, asynchronous audio, and janky transitions. This update addresses all of these problems, enhancing the realism and fluidity of the hammering sequences.[/left]

**Key Features:**

  
* **Realistic Sound Design:**
    
  [list]
Replaces the high-pitched metal clank with a more authentic wooden resonance, accurately simulating the sound of hammering a nail into wood.
  
* The new audio captures the subtle vibration of wood, enhancing immersion during crafting and repair animations.

[\*]**Synchronized Audio and Animation:**
  

  
* Fixes the asynchronous audio where the hammer sound would play while the hammer was still in the air.
The sound is now precisely synchronized with the moment the hammer strikes the wood or nail, providing a more cohesive experience.
  

[\*]**Improved Head Tracking:**
  

  
* During idle moments in the animation loop, actors now look around naturally instead of staring blankly at the wall.
Enhanced head-tracking allows NPCs to glance at nearby actors or events, adding a touch of realism and life to the scene.
  

[\*]**Smoother Animation Transitions:**
  

  
* Corrects janky animation cycles where the hammer appeared to jump between positions, indicating skipped frames or poorly set keyframes.
The hammer now moves smoothly between the wall and the actor’s hand, maintaining consistent motion throughout the animation loop.
  

[\*]**Natural Idle-to-Loop Transitions:**
  

  
* Fixes the abrupt, non-linear arm movements when transitioning from hammering to idle.
Animations now flow more naturally, improving the overall visual experience.
  

[\*]**Proper Animation Object Handling:**
  

  
* Previously, the hammer would instantly disappear as soon as the last hit was made.
Now, the actor visibly puts the hammer down before stashing it away, maintaining continuity and realism.
  

[/list]**Why This Fix is Essential:**
  
The default hammering animation in Skyrim was plagued with several issues that broke immersion, from inaccurate sounds to awkward, janky transitions. This fix not only enhances the auditory experience but also smooths out the animation and adds natural head-tracking behaviors, making the world feel more alive. Whether you're a roleplayer or a mod enthusiast seeking improved NPC interactions, this mod is a must-have for a more polished Skyrim experience.
