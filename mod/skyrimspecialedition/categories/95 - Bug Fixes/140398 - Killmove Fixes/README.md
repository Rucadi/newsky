Details**
  
Skyrim’s kill move system has always been flawed. From unfair instant deaths to animation-breaking paralysis effects, these issues make finishing moves unreliable and frustrating. This mod is a professional, lightweight fix that improves kill move mechanics while ensuring compatibility with modern combat mods.
  
**Key Fixes & Improvements:**✅ **No More Killmoves on the Player**
  

  
* In vanilla, a kill move triggers if an enemy attack *would* kill you. However, once the animation starts, you’re locked in—you can't block, dodge, or use last-second survival mechanics.
This is especially problematic with combat mods that emphasize *attack commitment* (e.g., Dark Souls-like combat systems).
  
* With this fix, enemies can no longer execute kill moves on you, preserving fair gameplay balance.

✅ **Fix for Paralysis Effects Breaking Kill Moves**
  

  
* Previously, if an enemy was hit by a paralysis enchantment or effect *during* a kill move, they would drop to the ground, causing all subsequent kill move attacks to miss.
Now, paralysis effects no longer interfere with kill moves, ensuring they play out properly.
  

✅ **Fix for Killmoves Not Finishing Off Enemies**
  

  
* Rarely, melee kill moves would leave enemies alive despite the finishing animation playing.
This issue was much more common with archery kill cams, where an arrow kill move would trigger, but the enemy would still be standing afterward.
  
* This fix ensures that any kill move that plays properly will always result in a fatality.

✅ **Fix for Bullseye Perk & Paralyze Effects During Killmoves**
  

  
* The vanilla Bullseye perk in the Archery skill tree has a 15% chance to paralyze enemies. If this effect triggered *during* an archery kill move, it could cause:[list]
The corpse becoming unlootable.
  
* The enemy falling off a cliff before the arrow even lands.
General janky behavior where paralysis overrides the kill move logic.
  

  
[\*]This fix prevents Bullseye’s paralysis from triggering during a kill move, ensuring a smooth, predictable execution.
  
[/list]✅ **Fix for Bullseye Perk’s Premature Paralysis Effect**
  

  
* Outside of kill moves, Bullseye’s paralysis effect sometimes applied *before* the arrow actually hit the target.
This fix ensures that paralysis properly applies *after* the arrow lands, maintaining logical consistency.
  

**Compatibility & Installation**

  
* **Compatible with all combat mods, including Dark Souls-like combat overhauls.**
**Works with all vanilla and modded weapons.**
  
* **Lightweight script-free solution—safe to install/uninstall anytime.**

Say goodbye to Skyrim’s broken kill move system and enjoy a smoother, more balanced combat experience!
