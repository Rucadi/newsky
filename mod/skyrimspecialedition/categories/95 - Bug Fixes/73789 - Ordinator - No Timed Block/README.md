# Ordinator - No Timed Block

DESCRIPTION
  
With the release of new combat mods that implement timed block features or change the way blocking work, I have felt the need to tweak the block perk tree from the excellent [Ordinator - Perks of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1137) mod by [EnaiSiaion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3959191).
  
All credits to them for the amazing work! There's no way I'd consider removing it from my game... so I had to make a small modification to add those new amazing mods (most recently [Valhalla Combat](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64741) by [dTry](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/77140323)). It may be updated in the future to integrate fully with Ordinator so this mod will become obsolete!
  
  
  
I found this mod with the same idea by [dTry](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/77140323):  [Ordinator - Maximum Combat Compatibility](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54062) 
  
The only caveat would be that this one replaces the entire ordinator esp, which could potentially cause some issues with updates or other mods... So I decided to make my own version as an esp (flagged esl) that only modifies a few records from Ordinator. I decided to share it for all, hopefully it works for y'all too!
  
  
  
**CHANGES MADE:**
  
So here are the changes: 
  

  
* Block Mastery (2) - No change
Timed Block (2) - removed from the tree (not from the mod, I simply did not display it)
  
* Deflect Arrows - No change
Poke the Dragon - removed from the tree
  
* Apocalypse Proof (2) - removed from the tree, but I added another perk to compensate this, based on the vanilla perk, see next point
Elemental protection (2) - Added perk. Blocking with a shield reduces incoming fire, frost, and shock damage by 50% / 75%. Requires 50 / 75 block
  
* Power Bash - No change
Quick Reflexes - No change
  
* Dominion - No change to the effect, only the position in the tree was altered, as well as the unlock requirements (50-> 60 block)
Skull Rattler - No change to the effect, only the position in the tree was altered
  
* Dragon Tail - Removed from the tree
Timing Streak - Removed from the tree
  
* Block Runner - No change to the effect, only the position in the tree was altered, as well as the unlock requirements (70-> 80 block)
Mocking Blow - Slightly altered the last effect which was conditional to the timed block featurs. My version is simply conditional to blocking, and is a 30% decrease in damage blocked for the duration of the effect, instead of a 100% reduction on a timed block 
  
* Break Their Teeth - Removed from the tree
Cast Aside - No change to the effect, only the position in the tree was altered, as well as the unlock requirements (80 -> 90 block)
  
* Deliverance - Removed from the tree
Hold the Line - Removed from the tree
  
* Unstoppable Force - This is now the ultimate perk, requiring 100 block. Changed position in the tree, not the effect.
Dragon Scales - Removed from the tree
  

  
  
The perk tree now looks like this (closer to vanilla actually, while retaining perks from Ordinator)

Hopefully this description is clear enough for you, and the mod works as intended.
  
  
  
**INSTALLATION**: 
  
There should not be any issue mid-game as I did not remove any of the perks. I do suggest removing the perks that were taken off the tree from your character before adding the mod. Since the perks are still there (just hidden from view) you will see their effect ingame still
  
  
To install the mod, just install with your mod manager.
  
Or if you don't use one (shame on you!) place it manually in the Skyrim/Data folder 
  
  
  
**UNINSTALLATION**:
  
Remove the Elemental Protection perks from your character beforehand.
  
Should be safe to uninstall mid-game but one never knows!
  
  
  
Credits to EnaiSaion for Ordinator!
