# Mannequins Behave

This mod simply makes it so mannequins cannot move, from my own testing (around 20 hours in a modded player home adding about 40 mannequins to a single cell with a somewhat heavy but not massively heavy load order,. 80 or so mods, none of my mannequins have moved once, despite previously moving literally every time the cell loaded. Furthermore it uses 0 scripts which makes it very reliable as even with lots of scripts going on it should still function correctly (this is the main reason I can find that navmeshes don't work after too many mannequins are in a cell) It will also work, as previously alluded to, with any mod houses that have lots of mannequins so long as they are default mannequins (for example I use skyfall estate which works fine) another thing that navmeshes couldn't do as they had to be added to each individual mannequin. I hope this mod is successful for you all as it is me! Have a great day! 
  
  
Please endorse this mod if it works for you! If this truly fixes the issue of mannequins moving i want to get it seen by as many people as possible, especially if modders can in some way improve on any flaws in my approach. Thanks in advance :D
  
  
Compatibility: Will be compatible with everything that doesn't change the "manakin race" file (yes its spelt like that in creation kit for some reason) There has been some mixed responses as to compatibility with female modelled mannequins so the jury is still out but it doesn't seem to cause any major breaks so if you're feeling brave (back up your save) test it out and give me more feedback to work with!

Also a sidenote: incase anyone stumbles upon this mod page who plays via xbox, ps4 or uses bethesda.net mods on PC this mod is on all of these under the name "Mannequins Behave"
  
  
How it works okay its very VERY simple. literally ALl i did was go the the "manakin race" file (yes its spelt like that for some reason) and changed the "immobile" tick box from being unticked.... to ticked. LITERALLY all i did. this mod is very much just a singular tick box solution. 
  
  
furthermore if you come across any conflicts, i would urge you, rather than asking me to patch it for my mod, as im a complete novice modder, before this i had never even opened the creation kit, to instead go to the author of that mod and ask them to patch my fix into their mod, it should theoretically work with any mannequin mod so long as they do the same fix on their end, and as i dont know what im doing when it comes to modding i just worry i'll mess something up :P
