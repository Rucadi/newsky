Mod Description
  
  
This plugin aims to fix interactions between projectiles that have an explosion attached and bounding (trigger) boxes.
  
  
Features
  
  
By default, if a character receives a projectile or it's attached explosion damage while touching a bounding (trigger) box, the game wrongly applies it's damage multiple times, based on distance. This plugin aims to fix that issue by filtering collisions that involves them.
