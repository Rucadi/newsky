I've passed on this bug to both RS Children and RS Children Compendium, but this is a temporary fix. I will remove when the mods are updated
  
  
**This is for people who use patches from the RS Children Patch Compendium.** The original RS Children mod does not need this. For example, if you use the Interesting NPCs patch for RS Children, you might have noticed Henrietta Entius (Falkreath) to have weird shiny hair, this will fix that. 
  
  
The reason is that the normal map is not linked properly to the mesh. You can even see this in the RS Children Patch Compendium screenshots (No.4). They are not meant to look like that! 
  
  
Here is my example

To save people having to unpack the .bsa and change the paths, i created the directory and put the normal map there, so you can install this mod as a loose texture, and it will fix it in game. As seen below
