This mod born after the great success of [Lightened Riverwood](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50433). What it mainly does is to delete elements (disable reference) like plants/clutters/stones that you can't probably notice and underground elements that are not visible. It touches both the area outside the cities and the 5 main cities.  Everythings we touched (for now) are into the **changelog**. Please let us know if you have any **improvements** about **fps**. Enjoy. Contrary to what one may think this mod is for mid/high-end computer. Of course all kind of computers can have improves from this mod!

It can be installed either modularly (city only or only external) or complete via the convenient fomod**.** The mod is flagged ESM and ESP-FE so won't count within the 255 *esp* limit. Install and let LOOT choose order.

This mod is built using as base [**USSEP**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266) and **[Landscape and Water Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26138)** (these are **NOT** required but guys... you really should use both as general rule!). It is compatible with everything (I tried differents mod and I didn't notice anyproblem). You can try this in combo with all graphical mods that you prefer (open cities, jk's and so on). No navmesh were deleted.[/font]

**Q**: I found some suspicious records that seem dirty records and bla bla bla?
