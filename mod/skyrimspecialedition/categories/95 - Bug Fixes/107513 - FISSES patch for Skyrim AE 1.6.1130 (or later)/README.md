# FISSES patch for Skyrim AE 1.6.1130 (or later)
- Author: epinter
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/107513


[epinter](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/18822034) rebuilt FISSES and hosted a version of it at his [github](https://github.com/epinter/fisses-ng/releases).
  
  
It should work with any version of the game (tested with 1.6.640 and 1.6.1130). 
  
  
[epinter](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/18822034) made minimum changes to the code [TerenceYao](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/2684071) published here, so the mod should be functional as before, the intention is just to make it work with the newer game releases.
  
  
[epinter](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/18822034) didn't include the scripts or the ESP in the download, so you still need to download the [original](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13956) and overwrite it with this patch.
  
  
[epinter](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/18822034) doesn't plan to maintain this mod on Nexus, he doesn't have the free time for it, but gives permission for anyone else to upload it, so here you are. I did, so me and other people can find it more easily if needed.
