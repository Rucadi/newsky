〜Swimming Mount Animation Fix〜**[/size]﻿**[size=6]**[/size]

  
Custom mounts (Sabrecat mounts, wolf mounts, guars...) are bugged if you jump into the water with them. I'll let the gif show you:

**The "Solution" aka Workaround**
  
With this mod, the behavior above technically still happens, since I'm not modifying the animation behavior files (this mod won't require that you run Nemesis/FNIS or similar tools) but I'm replacing the bugged animations with the correct animations via OAR, so everything will seem fine even when it bugs out.
  
  
No ESP, just animations replaced via Open Animation Replacer.
  
  
  
  
**The Backstory**
  
The year is 2019. I'm playing Enderal and I get a super cool wolf mount. I jump in water while riding it and *the horror,*my character starts swimming in the air above the water*.*I get out of the water, horrified, and my character starts doing acrobatics on top of the wolf mount.*What in the skooma is this?!*
  
Fast forward to 2025. Bug is still happening with custom mounts. Oh no.
  
  
**Requirements**

**Mods suffering from the bug**Mods that add custom mounts that don't resemble horses, such as:
  

  
* Guar Mounts ([Mihail Guars](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44491), [4thUnknown Guars](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38857)...)
Sabrecat Mounts ([Skills of the Wild](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37693)﻿, other taming mods)
  
* Wolf Mounts (Enderal, any mods that include wolf mounts)
Etc.

**ESL flagged? Safe to install mid-save?**You can install or uninstall at any point. The mod has no ESP, just animation files.
  
  
**Do I need to run FNIS/Nemesis?**No, all you need to have is OAR installed.
  
  
**It's not working! It's still bugged for me!**Maybe you didn't install OAR properly OR you have animations that have higher priority than these. Try increasing the priority.
  
  
**Can I use DAR instead?**No, it requires a condition only available in OAR. DAR was revolutionary and it's still an amazing mod, but it's the year 2025 of our Lord Talos, you should switch to OAR already. 
  
  
**The weapons are sort of bugged after jumping in water with my custom mount!**This bugfix (more like a workaround) hides the issue visually, but technically you're still swimming above water. Dismount and mount to fix it.
  
  
**Are you still working on new mods for Skyrim? You don't publish as often anymore!**Life happens! I've been modding the same game for 5 years now, give me a break lol. Most of my modding time these days goes into the [Gate to Sovngarde](https://www.nexusmods.com/games/skyrimspecialedition/collections/qdurkx) modlist. It's not like I've been sitting on my ass either, the modlist has an [insane changelog](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PZMxn1GjCr3GBEoSKxsexAaHKq1L1_Z-dQo79-D9XTo/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.x4qqacrnyjb) of 300 pages with tons of custom content and is still getting updated monthly. I'm also working on "regular" mods on the side, but I don't have as much time, so I'm taking it easy there.
  
  
**GTS sounds nice, but I don't want to use Vortex!**
  
There's a (beta) wabbajack version of GTS for MO2 users, it can be found in the [discord](https://discord.com/invite/jayserpa) for the time being.
