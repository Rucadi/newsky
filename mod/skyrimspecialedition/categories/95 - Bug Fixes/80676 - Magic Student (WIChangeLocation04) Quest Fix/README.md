**Description**
  

* There is a bug in [Magic Student (WIChangeLocation04)](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Magic_Student)﻿ where the quest fails without the objective ever disappearing from your quest log:
  > ﻿Loading through doors (into your house for example) will result in the Student disappearing from the city when you go back outside. A quest marker will be present, but is not visible on the map, leaving no way to finish or remove the quest from the log.[right]-- UESP[/right]
USSEP tried to fix it, but it didn't account for all cases.
  
* This mod fixes it for real.
Just a script fix
  
* No ESP

**Installation/Uninstallation/Update**
  

  
* Whenever. Doesn't matter

**To fix your existing save after the bug has already happened**
  

  
* Use console command: ResetQuest WIChangeLocation04
Or just wait for the quest to trigger again if you're using Tarlazo's [Here We Go Again - World Interactions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/37207)﻿ mod
