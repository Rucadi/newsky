**Want a nicer looking Forsworn helmet?**
  
Have a look at my new [Racc’s Headdress](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/147060)﻿ mod

  
  
  
  
[size=6]**Ever noticed how injured soldiers can wear head bandages but not you?!**[/size]When I needed them to work on any of my characters, they did not and I didn’t find anything else which **makes them work** like a clothing item normally does.
  
  
[size=4]Wearing them has been done before but **a fix to the real problem** has to exist, right?
  
  
[/size]I made the missing meshes needed to fix the problem. *So Players, Argonians, Elves, Orcs, Khajiit and everyone else can finally wear one* ***on their head****.*
  
  
**[size=5][size=5][size=3]Want one on the right or the left? Now you can.[/size][/size][/size]***[size=5][size=5]**![](https://staticdelivery.nexusmods.com/mods/1704/images/98659/98659-1694812608-1519324174.jpeg)***[/size][size=5][/size][/size]
  
[size=5]**INSTRUCTIONS**[/size]
  

  
1. One Linen Wrap at a tanning rack gives you one head bandage.
**Wearing a bandage on your head** while using a tanning rack gives you the option to switch sides on the bandage.
  

  
  
**CAMPFIRE INSTRUCTIONS**
  
*With Campfire installed you can make a bandage or switch sides of the one you got, anywhere.*
  

  
1. One Linen Wrap using the *create item* power = one head bandage.
**Wearing a bandage on your head** while using the create item ability gives you the option to switch sides on the bandage.

* [size=4]Elves, Orcs, Khajiit and Argonians now have bandages that work and fit on their head.
  
Usable by the player and has a right and left version.
  
- [size=4]Uses an actual bandage mesh for inventory and ground object. [/size][size=4]*Skyrim normally used the Greybeard’s hood for this.*[/size]
[size=4]Enchantable and used in place of a circlet. *They always* [/size][size=4]*were* [/size][size=4]*but* [/size][size=4]*now you can actually use them.*[/size]
  
- ESL-flagged and does not count towards your mod limit.
Campfire & Frostfall support is built-in, but they are not required.
  
- Made at a tanning rack or with Campfire’s crafting system.
Vanilla plus. Made to feels like it was always part of the game.

**USABLE SKYRIM BANDAGES REDRESSED**
  
  
As of version 2.1 there is a small extension named Usable Skyrim Bandages Redressed. The one currently available enables healing functionality.
  
  
If I was a cynical Raccoon, I would be imagining two type of reactions. First, that adding 5% improved health regeneration to bandages is too much! It’s a free enchant that has not been earned! I had such a hard time testing this because of how slow it was. Skyrim’s passive health regen is much stronger than this, making it hard to tell.
  
  
If you on the other hand like the danger, difficulty and the Oblivion of no health regen (***player.forceav healratemult 0*** and ***player.forceav combathealthregenmult 0***) then you will be positively thrilled to learn that you can recover your entire health in the time it takes to walk from Riften to Solitude and back. The second type of reaction is people having actual real life bruises heal faster than this. For the rest of you, enjoy. 
  
  
  
**INSTALLATION**
  
  
Preferably use a mod manager to install the mod.
  
  
  
**COMPATIBILITY**
  
  
The mod changes ClothesHeadBandages (the regular Skyrim head bandages) to add new armor addons which then add new models to their respective races, while keeping the original armor addon and old models untouched. That way if a mod bypasses ClothesHeadBandages and uses those directly, it will still work the way it used to.
  
  
It’s a good compromise to ensure that mods don’t need to be patched. A simple mesh replacer is impossible because the affected races have very different head shapes and one mesh does not fit all. If mods use the normal ClothesHeadBandages, they get my meshes, if not they get the old ones.
  
  
The models all use the same texture paths and texture layout as the regular Skyrim head bandage models, so anything which works with those works great with mine. 
  
[Rustic Clothing](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4703) is highly recommended if you’re looking to improve its textures.
