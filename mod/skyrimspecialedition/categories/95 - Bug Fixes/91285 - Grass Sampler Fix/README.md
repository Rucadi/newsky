The vanilla grass does not use anisotropic filtering. This mod forces it to use anisotropic filtering which improves detail at a minor cost to performance.
  
  
This also improves the **Skyrim Upscaler** by letting it correctly adjust grass when upscaling. This mod was originally designed to fix an issue with the Skyrim Upscaler but was found to improve vanilla as well.
  
  
Does not require TAA or the Skyrim Upscaler.
  
  
  
**TIP**
  
  
Because this makes grass look more dense, you can try reducing the real grass density to improve performance!
