[font=Arial]Skyrim Landscape and Water Fixes is a huge collection of fixes regarding graphic glitches,[color=#d8d8d8] misplaced objects, landscape texture seams, holes in the landscape, mesh bugs, etc., as well as some navmesh, ownership and other issues around Tamriel worldspace. ﻿[/color][/font][font=Arial]It also removes some duplicate objects and objects completely hidden under the ground, which can slightly increase FPS in several areas. While SLaWF started fixing only landscape and water issues, it has expanded with other similar types of fixes ﻿over time [/font][font=Arial]and now includes all the ﻿aforementioned fixes, including fixes for interiors. Those accustomed to noticing details will certainly have found some of these annoying issues, from now on you can say goodbye to all these problems. [color=#d8d8d8][color=#d8d8d8]SLaWF complements [USSEP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266)﻿﻿﻿, fixing issues that USSEP doesn't fix.[/color]
  
  
SLaWF also makes crops and chicken eggs around Skyrim actually owned by their owners, so that taking them is considered a crime. A new dialogue is added to farmers (the ones that buy crops from you) to ask them if you can gather their crops. Once a farmer granted permission (done by making you friends), their crops can be collected legally without stealing. You can pick the "Free Crops" option in the installer if you don't want this feature. A different approach is implemented in [Favor Jobs Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40145/)﻿.[/font]

[font=Arial]Install the mod with your mod manager, don't forget to check the patches in the installer.[/font]
  
The recommended position for Landscape and Water Fixes.esp is right after Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp.
  
Make sure all the patches are placed after both SLaWF and the mods they're made for.
  
  
[font=Arial]Compatibility with mods editing the same meshes:
  

  
* Let SLaWF meshes overwrite [SMIM](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/659)﻿,[Enhanced texture detail (UV-tweaks)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/992)﻿, [ELFX](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2424)﻿ and [No Sunlight Through Mountains](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45401)﻿.
Let meshes from other WiZkiD, [Majestic Mountains](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11052)﻿ and [Flickering Meshes Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53957) overwrite SLaWF.
  
* For other mods you can decide which mod should win the conflict yourself. SLaWF meshes are fixed carefully, especially regarding collisions, therefore you can overwrite most other mesh fix mods. If it's necessary, you can let other mods overwrite SLaWF at the cost of losing our fixes for those meshes.

Compatibility with some other mods:
  

  
* Due to the nature of some fixes, [Better Dynamic Snow](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9121)﻿ v2.x users are advised to use [Better Dynamic Snow Patcher xEdit](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33278).
The "Faction Stealing" patch from [powerofthree's Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51073)﻿ breaks the crops harvesting permission dialogue (it won't actually give you permission) if enabled, so don't enable that patch in its .ini (leave it disabled, as it is by default). Though, you can enable it if you also use [Favor Jobs Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40145/)﻿ or if you picked the "Free Crops" installer option.
  
* The two errors reported by xEdit with [Navigator](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52641) ﻿loaded ("REFR \ XNDP - Navmesh Door Link \ Teleport Marker Triangle -> <Warning: Navmesh triangle not found in ...") are actually fixed in our Navigator patch, you can ignore them if you have the patch.

[/font][size=3][font=Arial]Although it is not strictly necessary, we highly suggest you install both [Landscape Fixes for Grass Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9005)﻿ and [Flickering Meshes Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53957)﻿.[/font]
