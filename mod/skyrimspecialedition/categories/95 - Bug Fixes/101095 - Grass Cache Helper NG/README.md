**Description**
  
  
**-** Grass Cache Helper NG hooks the game at runtime to modify **\*.GID** file loading to **\*.CGID** file loading. This allows **\*.CGID** files generated by "No Grass In Objects" to be used by the game without renaming them. So you don't need to rename files anymore and you don't need to replace buggy .gid files from the game.
  
  
**-** It supports [Seasons of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62861) by detecting the current season and loading the correct **\*.[SPR|SUM|AUT|WIN].CGID** file automatically. Seasons of Skyrim support includes support for season overrides by other mods as well. If you don't wish to use this feature, you should disable seasonal grass types from Seasons of Skyrim's config file (po3\_SeasonsOfSkyrim.ini) for each season by setting Grass = false.
  
  
**-** It allows adding/removing "No Grass" flag for worldspaces without the need for an esp file. By default, config file includes settings for WhiterunWorld(removes flag) and KatariahWorld(adds flag).
  
  
**-** It applies﻿ recommended ini settings automatically by detecting the situation such as: 
  

  
* [size=3]Automatically sets bAllowCreateGrass, bAllowLoadGrass, bGenerateGrassDataFiles settings in the game ini by detecting if you are generating precache or not.
  
Automatically calculates and sets iGrassCellRadius, fGrassStartFadeDistance, fGrassFadeRange using uGridsToLoad setting.
  
- Automatically sets bEnableGrassFade setting to 0. This is recommended if you are using Grass LODs **(Not detected automatically, so set this to 1 from the config if you are not using Grass LODs).**
These are all optional and can be modified from this mod's config file named **GrassCacheHelperNG.ini****This mod is compiled using CommonLib-NG and it's compatible with SE/AE/VR/GOG - All versions of the game.**[/size]**FAQ**
  
Q- When I have this mod enabled. there is no grass visible in game. when I have this mod Disabled all my grass is visible. What would be causing this issue?
  
  
A- This mod enables loading grass instead of creating it at runtime. If all your grass disappears, one of these things happened:
  
  
- You don't have a grass cache installed (.cgid files that can be generated with NGIO). If this is the case, you need to generate grass precache or install an already generated grass cache downloaded from here on nexus.
  
  
- You have a grass cache installed, but you have Seasons of Skyrim installed, and the grass cache you installed do not have seasonal grass caches (\*.SPR|SUM|AUT|WIN.CGID files). If this is the case, you can either generate seasonal grass cache and install that as well or disable seasonal grass from Seasons of Skyrim config file.
  
  
**Requirements**
  
  
**-** [Address Library for SKSE plugins](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444): If you are on SE/AE/GOG. Install the correct file according to your game version (Or install both version 2 and 8, no harm in that).
  
  
**-** [VR Address Library for SKSEVR](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/58101): If you are on VR. Install the latest version.
  
  
**-** [SKSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30379) or [SKSEVR](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30457)
  
  
**If you are using [Seasons of Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62861), make sure it's the latest version. SKSE API support which this mod uses is added in version 1.8.**
  
  
In version 1.0.1, support for earlier versions of Seasons of Skyrim is added. Note that, mods that override seasons using papyrus api are not supported when you are not using version 1.8+.
  
  
  
**Usage**
  
**For generating precache:**
  
**-** Install Grass Cache Helper NG. It will detect that you are generating precache and set game ini settings automatically.
  
**-** Generate \*.cgid files (and .SPR|SUM|AUT|WIN.cgid files if you want to use it with Seasons of Skyrim) normally with "**No Grass In Objects**". Make sure you use DynDOLODGrassMode=1. Refer to**[Step Grass LOD Guide](https://stepmodifications.org/wiki/SkyrimSE:Grass_LOD_Guide)﻿**which now uses this mod.
  
  
Note: Some people are reporting that grass cache generation while [BEES](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106441) is active is causing bad grass precache. So if you are having issues with your grass precache, try to generate with it disabled.
  
  
  
**Here's a guide for Generating Grass precache without seasons: [How to Generate Grass Cache](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/6919)
  
Here's a guide for Generating Grass precache for seasons:**[**How to Generate Grass Cache (with Seasons)**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/6920)
  
  
  
**For using precache:
  
-** Install Grass Cache Helper NG in your regular mod list. It will detect that you are not generating precache and set game ini settings automatically.
  
**-** Copy your grass precache (\*.cgid files) to the mod list as well. Always leave it enabled, because they will be used. Make sure your grass precache files are in "Data\Grass\" folder. In MO2, this would require them to be in a "Grass" folder inside the mod folder.
  
**-** (OPTIONAL) Generate Grass LOD with DynDOLOD. You don't have to rename precache files and you don't have to change DynDOLOD GrassGID setting to gid, leave it as GrassGID=cgid which is the default.
  
**-** ~~You need to disable NGIO in your mod list for normal play if you want to use seasonal grass, otherwise it would overwrite the hooks of this mod.~~ You can have NGIO enabled now when loading seasons grass precaches in the latest versions of NGIO, but not necessary for simply loading grass caches, because this mod already handles it.
  
**-** No setting changes required. When you are ready, open the game and you'll be using grass precache instead of creating the grass on the fly. Everything else is done automatically.
  
  
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
You don't need [Grass Cache Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/60891) anymore. This mod does everything it does and more. You now save some time and an esp slot and also have Seasons of Skyrim support with this.
