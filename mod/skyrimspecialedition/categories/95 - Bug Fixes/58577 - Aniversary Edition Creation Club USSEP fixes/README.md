[size=1]I no longer play the game. I am leaving this 'as is' with no support.[/size]

  
  
Edit: ﻿[Unofficial Skyrim Creation Club Content Patches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18975?tab=posts) was updated (November 21). I have updated this mod and removed what is fixed by that mod. You should now install that mod before mine. Mine still has some minor fixes. Survival mode fixes mod is now not needed, because those fixes are included in that mod too.
  
  
Simple fixes for creation club mods contained in anniversary edition of Skyrim with some changes forwarded from USSEP.
  
This requires most of the anniversary edition mods, not only the free ones, which came with last update!
  
This is manually made from SSEEdit - show conflicts filter. Quickly made for my own use and shared until ﻿[Unofficial Skyrim Creation Club Content Patches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18975?tab=posts) is updated.
  
Survival mode is not patched and requires another mod.

Current "fixes":
  

  
* Alternative Armors - Silver: forwards lock data for chest in Lund's Hut from the mod and chest location from USSEP
Forgotten Seasons - changes deleted Wheet object to disabled.
  
* Fishing - forwards fishing rod placements, discards USSEP position changes (mod also moves them a little, I keep changes from the mod, probably not an issue). Forwards lantern position from the mod, instead of USSEP position. Forwards Salmon changes.
