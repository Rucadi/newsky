Since the authors of [size=3][Hestra's Nest](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70098)﻿ have stated that they won't be updating the mod any further nor release any bug fixes, I decided to release my own fixed version of the mod. Right now these are the fixes I have done:
  
  
[/size]

  
* A full pass of the exterior navmesh, fixing internal and cell border edge links, adding a few triangles here and there where they were missing, and fixing other navmesh related issues I came across. Now the worldspace should be fully accessible to followers.
Fixed some duplicated and clipping objects.
  
* Fixed an erroneous texture path on one tree mesh.
Fixed a bug in the Friends quest that prevented it from progressing if the player had more than the required number of flowers in their inventory.
  
* Calculated Max Height data similar to what [Hestra's Nest - Dragon Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/83811)﻿ does.
Added a DLC patch which resolves conflicts with the Dawnguard DLC. This was necessary, as adding Dawnguard as a master to the plugin seems to break some dialogue.
  
  

**Requirements:**
  
This mod is a plugin and asset replacer and only contains the fixed files. [size=3][size=3][Hestra's Nest](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70098)[/size] is required for the rest.[/size]
  
  
**[size=4]Installation:**
  
Overwrite any files from [Hestra's Nest](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70098)﻿.
  
  
[/size]**[size=4]Compatibility:**
  
Due to some navmesh splitting the Creation Kit decided to do, [More to do in Hestra's Nest](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/71713) is incompatible. There is a plugin replacer as an optional file to fix the incompatibilities. This plugin replacer is for version 1.2.2 of More to do and is incompatible with any other version. If More to do is updated the plugin replacer needs to be updated too.
  
[Revoiced Hestra's Nest](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/109009) - fully compatible
  
[Hestra's Nest - Dragon Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/83811) - redundant but compatible
