**Description**
  
Fixes that Stormcloaks don't fight with Thalmor. Yes, you heard me correctly, they don't. Well, there is one random encounter (WE33 "Thalmor vs Stormcloaks"), when you encounter Thalmor fighting with Stormcloaks somewhere in the wilderness. But in any other situation they won't fight if they see each other. For example, if you start a fight with a Thalmor patrol and try to get some help from Stormcloaks at a nearby camp, like i did in this video, they won't fight each other and the Stormcloaks will just watch your fight from a distance[size=2]. And yes, it's not fixed by USSEP. 
  
  
  
  
Another exception is NPCs added by [Immersive Patrols](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/718) because they use their own factions. The Stormcloak and Thalmor patrols added by it do fight with each other and vanilla NPCs of the opposite faction even without this mod *(no, it doesn't make this mod redundant because vanilla Stormcloak NPCs still don't fight with vanilla Thalmor NPCs)*.
  
  
So, this mod makes any Stormcloak NPC (including guards in holds currently controlled by Stormcloaks) and any Thalmor NPC fight when they see each other.
  
  
Let me know if you find any NPCs that are not covered or must be excluded. It shouldn't cause issues with Season Unending, since the involved NPCs already get added to a special faction that makes them friendly to each other during the quest. This mod also removes the 3 thalmor spies that you encounter during the main questline (Gissur, J'datharr and Shavari) from ThalmorFaction, so that guards don't attack them. Ancano is also excluded.
  
[/size]**Requirements**
  
  
There's a No Requirements (normal) version and a [SkyPatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106659) version, which requires SkyPatcher and is more compatible.
  
**Compatibility**
  
  

  
* Compatible with [USSEP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266).
The SkyPatcher version doesn't edit any vanilla records and ﻿therefore shouldn't conflict with anything. The No Requirements version edits Gissur, J'datharr and Shavari and may conflict with other mods editing them.
  
* This mod works by setting relations between factions, not specific NPCs, and therefore works with mod-added NPCs that use vanilla factions. Let me know if there are any mod-added NPCs that this mod doesn't affect.
