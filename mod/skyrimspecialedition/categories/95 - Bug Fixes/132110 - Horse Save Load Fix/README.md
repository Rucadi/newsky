**Description**
  

  
* There is vanilla bug where if you load a save where you're riding a horse, you and your horse will be uncontrollable and launch into the sky and fall to your deaths.
This mod fixes this.
  
* You remain mounted unlike other fixes.
There is a very small chance that you end up next to the horse. You can just dismount or reload the save if this happens.
  
  
* ESL

**Installation/Uninstallation/Update**
  

  
* Whenever. Doesn't matter.
