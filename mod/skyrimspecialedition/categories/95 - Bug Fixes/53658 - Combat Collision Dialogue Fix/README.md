﻿I made this since none of the existing mods addressing the issue (not even USSEP) are without their faults or shortcomings. It simply adds conditions to dialogue lines uttered when you sprint into NPCs such as "Be careful!", "Watch it!", "What's the hurry?", etc etc to ensure that they do not happen while 1: the NPC is in combat and 2: when they are dying. Because yes, it turns out that these lines can still trigger right as someone dies and technically exits combat, and this is why you keep hearing it during sprint attack kills even with the USSEP changes.
