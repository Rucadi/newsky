**⛏️ What This Mod Fixes ⛏️**In vanilla Skyrim, the **bleeding damage from axes is completely broken** and almost useless due to poor scaling and inconsistent mechanics.
  
This mod **fixes** the system so bleeding:
  
✅ **Scales properly** with weapon damage, perks, enchantments, power attacks and buffs.
  
✅ **Accounts for battleaxes’ slower attack speed** by giving them stronger, longer-lasting bleeding.
  
✅ **Works with all weapons**, including **DLC and Creation Club** content like Stalhrim and Saints & Seducers weapons.
  
✅ **No more bleeding on blocked attacks**—because an axe hitting a shield shouldn't cause a deep wound!
  
✅ **Standardized bleeding duration and damage logic**—no more random, inconsistent values!
  
[line]**? The Problems with Vanilla Bleeding ?**

  
* Bleeding is **weak and irrelevant**—when you hit for 200 damage, a 3 DPS bleed over 6 seconds does nothing.
Bleeding **doesn’t scale** with anything (perks, enchantments, potions, power attacks or smithing improvements).
  
* **Battleaxes get no advantage**—they apply the same bleeding as one-handed axes despite being slower and stronger.
**DLC and Creation Club weapons don’t work**—Stalhrim axes and others simply don’t apply bleeding.
  
* **Bleeding applies even if an enemy blocks**—which makes no sense.

[line]**?️ The Fixes ?️**

  
* **Bleeding now deals 20% of weapon damage per second** for **3/4/5 seconds**, depending on perk rank.
    
  [list]
At max rank, total bleed damage equals **100% of the weapon's damage.**
  

[\*]**Bleeding is now affected by:**
  
✅ One-Handed/Two-Handed **perks** that boost weapon damage.
  
✅ **Skill levels** in One-Handed/Two-Handed.
  
✅ **Enchantments, potions, and buffs** that increase weapon damage.[\*]**Battleaxes now get a bonus:**
  

  
* Bleeding lasts **1 second longer** than one-handed axes (4/5/6 seconds).
This compensates for their **slower attack speed**, making them a viable choice.
  

[\*]**Bleeding no longer applies if the enemy blocks the attack.**
  
[\*]**All axe-type weapons now properly apply bleeding,** including:
  
✅ **DLC weapons** like Stalhrim axes.
  
✅ **Creation Club weapons** (Saints & Seducers, etc.).[/list]
