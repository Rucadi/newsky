This mod fixes two DB DLC bugs. The first and far more annoying bug is the Tel Mithryn bug fix. Followers will sometimes get stuck in Tel Mithryn and wont follow you out when you leave. Tel Mithryn is far from unique in having followers sometimes get stuck there. Broken Oar Grotto is natorious for followers getting trapped there. However Tel Mithryn is in some ways worse.
  
  
Usually if your follower get stuck somewhere and you have a modded set up its no big deal. "Easy." You tell yourself. "I'll just use my follower framework/ Swiftly Order Squad/ that custom follower built in teleportation spell to get them out. Super easy! Barely an inconvenience!" **YOU SAY INNCORECLY!**As it turns out teleporting them out doesn't work. They just turn around and start walking away. You try telling them to wait, but they keep walking! You try dismissing them and rerecruiting them! But they keep walking. You try everything. But apprently they don't want to hang out with you anymore :(
  
  
Because they have an AI package active that tells them to go back to Tel Mithryn. It's very annoying. Esspecially if you don't know what's causing it. Fixing it is fairly easy. Just reenter Tel Mithryn and wait a few seconds then leave. And it will usually clear the AI package. But it can be very annoying if you've already left Solstheim. Or worse yet you just don't know what's going on. This mod fixes the issue!
  
  
  
**TLDR:** Followers will no longer get stuck in Tel Mithryn.
  
  
**Bug fix 2:** Fire Wyrm aggression
  
  
Fire Wyrms are a unique summon added by the Dragonborn DLC. Unfortunately despite being your allies. They would get into fights with your followers. This mod fixes that. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST MOD TO FIX IT.  However the other mod also made some other changes to fire wyrms (made them stronger). So I thought I would make a clean fix version. If you like the changes the other mod made and want stronger Fire Wyrms. But also want the Tel Mithryn fix from this mod. Just load that mod under this one in your load order.

**Compatibility:**There are a couple mods that offer a more complete overhual of Fire Wyrms rather then just the simple fix from this mod. These mods will like be "technically" incompatible with this one. That being said. It should be a simple matter of loading them after this one. This will overide the simple change this mod makes to Fire Wyrms with a their more comphrensive ones. While keeping the change to Tel Mithryn.
