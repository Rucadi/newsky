# NARC Remade  - No Animals Report Crimes for Skyrim SE

On 6/10/2018 Pharros changed the permissions of all of his mods to "You may do what you wish with the file as long as you credit me and don't distribute it on a separate mod hosting platform." That is why a SE version of NARC exists.
  
Find the original LE version [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/68125).
  
  
**Description:**
  
Bethesda for some reason never flagged animals and such to ignore crimes. Welp, now they will. No longer will a wild goat tell the guards what you've done. No longer will horses snitch. No longer will dragons report to the guards because you murdered someone/something they were planning to murder. :D

Patches and core versions should generally work with newer builds of supported mods than listed, but will not have been checked against them.
  
  
Know of a mod in need of a patch? Leave a comment letting me know.
  
  
If you are the creator or maintainer of one of the mods I have patched, feel free to implement my changes.
  
Please tell me if you do, there is no point in me keeping a redundant patch.

Its safe to merge the patches, but there is no real reason to do so.

**FAQ:**
  
**Q**. Do I need the Unofficial Patches?
  
**A**. No, but it is suggested.
  
  
**Q**. Xbox/PS4?
  
**A**. No. "Don't distribute it on a separate mod hosting platform."
  
  
**Q**. Support for other languages?
  
**A**. Only a few localized records are touched, you should be able to use it regardless of language.
  
  
**Q**. Are the plugins using form version 44?
  
**A**. Yes. The core vanilla plugin was ran through the CK64 and the others were made from the ground up in XEdit.
  
  
**Q**. Why NARC "Remade"
  
**A**. Because I remade all but the "vanilla" file, and even it was changed a bit.
