**Description**
  
  
Various quest fixes (doesn't include any of my previously released mods).
  
  
This mod fixes the following issues:
  
  
[Bleak Falls Barrow](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=bleak%20falls%20barrow%20uesp):
  

  
* When you exit the dialogue with Farengar after taking the quest, Farengar says a random goodbye dialogue that overlaps with the Balgruuf's dialogue from the quest scene, and you can't hear neither of them properly.

**[Battle for Whiterun (Stormcloaks)](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Battle_for_Whiterun_(Stormcloaks))**:
  

  
* If you manage to quickly activate Balgruuf after he starts saying the surrender line but before he finishes, instead of him just saying "I surrender! ..." you'll get the normal list of dialogues which then gets replaced with only one option "Do you surrender?", only after choosing which you get the correct dialogue.
New Stormcloak guards that come to Dragonsreach after Balgruuf surrenders say "I'm going to find whoever did this", etc. looking at dead bodies, since both are in the whiterun guard factions and are technically allies. The fix should also work for any other similar situations between NPCs in the Imperial and Stormcloak factions.
  

[Message to Whiterun (Imperial)](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Message_to_Whiterun_(Imperial))﻿:
  

  
* When you return with the axe to Dragonsreach, after the scene finishes, Legate Quentin Cipius just lays on the bed despite saying that the Stormcloaks are here and the battle is about to start. Not that the man can't chill a bit, but his behavior is the same as when he stays in Dragonsreach after the battle, and during the battle it doesn't really match the atmosphere.

[The Blessings of Nature](https://pt.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Blessings_of_Nature):
  

  
* After you return from Orphan Rock with Nettlebane to Danica, she's usually in the temple talking to Mauris, but if you quickly fast travel from Orphan Rock, then Danica may not be at the temple yet and if so, you won't naturally encounter Mauris in the temple, and even if you go to the temple and talk to him, his dialogue won't make sense because he couldn't hear your dialogue with Danica.
After you eliminated all the roots from your patch, Mauris initiates dialogue with you with "I had no idea you were a man of violence. What exactly are your intentions in this blessed place?". However, if you're too far from him, he won't approach you himself to initiate the dialogue, and even if you're close enough, he walks very slowly despite that he was running when following you earlier. I increased the radius at which he tries to approach you and made him run instead of slowly walking, so that he has a higher chance to approach you before you do anything.
  
* "I had no idea you were a man of violence. What exactly are your intentions in this blessed place?" dialogue might trigger after you already responded to that.
Increased the priority for the quest dialogues when returning with Nettlebane or the sap/sapling so that they're displayed at the top.
  

[No One Escapes Cidhna Mine](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:No_One_Escapes_Cidhna_Mine):
  

  
* Braig asks you "Do you have any family? Anyone waiting for you on the outside?" but the only options you have are "Yes, but they're far from Skyrim", "I have friends. Only family I need", "None that I care to talk about". But what if you already married or adopted a kid in Skyrim? I added an option "Yes, I do..." (haven't added any conditions to check if you actually have a spouse or a kid, in case you used some alternate start that gives you a family that's not registered like vanilla spouses/kids). Also added an option "No, I don't have anyone...".

[Served Cold](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Served_Cold)﻿:
  

  
* When you return to Adril at the end of the quest, Adril tells you to follow him to the Councilor even if he's sitting next to him ([size=2][video](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/videos/22547))[/size]

[Flight or Fight](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Flight_or_Fight)﻿:
  

  
* Grosta has 4 dialogues that get enabled after you take the quest to find Leifnarr ("If I ever catch my husband in bed with another woman, he's going to find himself homeless." and 3 dialogues about men being pigs), but they don't get disabled after you tell her that her husband disappeared not because he was cheating but because he was murdered.
Activating the Leifnarr's body again after completing the quest or failing it (if Grosta died) restarts the quest with an objective "Report Leifnarr's death to his family".
  

[Bloodlet Throne](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Bloodlet_Throne) location scene:
  

  
* If you aggro the boss or the other vampire at the end of the dungeon and then run away from the location, or the location simply resets, next time the boss and the other vampire may not attack you and will stand with weapons drawn until you get very close or attack them first.

[Northwatch Keep](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Northwatch_Keep) guard dialogues:
  

  
* The gate guard dialogue line "You have no business here, so keep walking." was never playing. Now it randomly plays instead of "Halt!", as it was probably supposed to.

  
**Compatibility**
  
  

  
* May conflict with other mods editing the same quests.
Place the .esp after [size=2][Relationship Dialogue Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1187)﻿ (any version of it) and [Erandur Dialogue Edits](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/83324)﻿. Conflicting edits from these mods are included.[/size]
  
* Place the .esp before [Skyrim Unbound Reborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27962). The conflicting files are the same so the overwriting order doesn't matter.
Place the .esp before [Heartwood Mill Quest Complement - Flight Or Fight Vanilla Quest Tweak](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/152035)﻿ and let it overwrite scripts from Quest Fixes.
