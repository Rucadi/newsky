Janky fix to an issue in Nikojaeger's [Half-Khajiit mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28702) in which the character's ears appear excessively reflective. I reduced their glossiness and specular strength as well as making the UV double sided (which mostly fixed it even before making the other changes). The ears still look a little strange to my eye so I'll be doubling back on this file once I become sufficiently annoyed with it as to motivate me to revisit the issue.
