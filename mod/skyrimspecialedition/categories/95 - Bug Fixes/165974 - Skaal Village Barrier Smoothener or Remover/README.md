In vanilla game the lighting of Skaal Village Barrier effect is rather questionable, it tends to flicker depending on camera angle, making it extremely irritating to look at.
  
  
This Banding Fix is based on the solution from [THIS](https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/1h510er/does_anyone_know_a_fix_for_this_skaal_village/) reddit post.
  
  
The Remover version is just a dummy mesh replacer to make the barrier invisible.
