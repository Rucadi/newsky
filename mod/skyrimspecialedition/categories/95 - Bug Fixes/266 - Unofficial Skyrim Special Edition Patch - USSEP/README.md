A comprehensive bugfixing mod for The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Special Edition. The goal of the Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch (aka USSEP) is to eventually fix every bug with Skyrim Special Edition not officially resolved by the developers to the limits of the Creation Kit and community-developed tools, in one easy-to-install package.
  
   
  
   Features:
  
   - Hundreds of gameplay, quest, NPC, object, item, text and placement bugs fixed.
  
   - Created by the authors of the Unofficial Oblivion Patch series.
  
   - No unsafe changes (such as deletions of stock objects).
  
   - Designed to be compatible with as many other mods as possible.

Are you using the Anniversary Edition DLC package? If so, you need to get Garthand's [Unofficial Skyrim Creation Club Content Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18975) and install it alongside the USSEP. This will prevent errors induced by these DLCs making changes to the base game records that USSEP then overrides. Please refer all questions about USCCCP to Garthand on his threads.
  
  
XBox users can download the [USCCCP here](https://creations.bethesda.net/en/skyrim/details/c86bbea6-b832-4bee-9a3f-2f1dbe6e2a1c/Unofficial_Skyrim_Creation_Club_Content_Patch).

DO NOT extract the contents of the BSA file into your Data folder as loose files, or let your mod manager perform an equivalent function on the contents of the file. Doing so will cause things to load in the wrong order and break the game. Skyrim is intended to load a BSA alongside it's ESM/ESP file. Circumventing this causes issues which I will not provide support for. If you insist on going against this advice, you will receive no support for the problems you generate as a result of this.
  
  
**Installation Requirements**
  
  
Skyrim Special Edition 1.6.1130 or greater from Steam, GoG, or the Epic Games Store.
  
  
After installing the mods, the following general load order needs to be followed:
  
  
Skyrim.esm
  
Update.esm
  
Dawnguard.esm
  
Hearthfires.esm
  
Dragonborn.esm
  
ccBGSSSE001-Fish.esm
  
ccQDRSSE001-SurvivalMode.esl
  
ccBGSSSE037-Curios.esl
  
ccBGSSSE025-AdvDSGS.esm
  
\_ResourcePack.esl
  
[any Creation Club master-flagged ESLs you may have]
  
Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch.esp
  
[The rest of your mods]
  
  
For getting load order set with other mods loaded, please use [LOOT](https://loot.github.io/). It will provide you a solid starting point for everything that you can then tweak as needed.
