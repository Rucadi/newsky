A small (but hopefully growing) selection of patches for various minor issues I encounter when running Blackthorn Manor with other mods. Currently only includes a small patch to fix a couple of terrain issues with Blackthorn Manor and Landscape Fixes for Grass Mods, a patch to fix CTDs when trying to use the Blackthorn Manor - Clay and Stone Deposits mod (now redundant :)), a patch that adds a Carriage and Ferry Travel Overhaul compatible carriage to Blackthorn, as well as adding Blackthorn as a carriage destination, a patch for Cathedral Landscapes that corrects some messy grass, as well as patches to add CACO food and alchemy items to the autosort barrel, as well as SE and AE autosorting patches for non CACO users who want to sort their foods and ingredients, and a patch that adds more lights around Blackthorn with a compatibility patch for LoS II.
  
  
If you'd like to skip the building and get to the playing check out my [Prebuilt Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72863) or check out [Blackthorn Male Patch SSE](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/10406-blackthorn-male-patch-sse-107z/) which prebuilds Blackthorn and changes the NPCs to male, as well as some other tweaks and changes (my Prebuilt Patch is inspired by this mod). Similarly, a [Prebuilt Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72883) is available for [The Scarlett](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2434) (there's also a Male NPC Changer mod available [here](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/10407-the-scarlett-male-patch/), made by the same creators as the Blackthorn Male Patch).
  
  
If you experience an issue running Blackthorn Manor with a mod that you think should be corrected, please let me know and I'll see if there's anything I can do about it (I am incredibly inexperienced I just want to share the fixes I use).
  
  
Please update Landscape Fixes For Grass Mods Patch to at least V1.2, this version fixes the landscape properly rather than replacing the cell's landscape with the vanilla landscape, pushing the "window into the void" somewhere else.
  
  
Blackthorn - Clay and Stone Deposits was updated to fix the CTD bug, my patch is no longer required.
  
  
Cathedral Landscapes patch includes Landscape Fixes For Grass Mods Patch (Does not require Landscape Fixes For Grass Mods), place Cathedral Landscapes patch below all of my patches (or just at the very end).Remove all autosorting patches and download the "[Dynamic Autosorting patch for Ld50365s' Player Homes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/93166) "instead! It is fully dynamic and mod independent and will load all correctly keyworded food items, ingredients, ingots, ores, pelts, and soul gems at game start from all of the mods you have loaded and add them to the autosorting barrels around Blackthorn and Scarlett Ship!
