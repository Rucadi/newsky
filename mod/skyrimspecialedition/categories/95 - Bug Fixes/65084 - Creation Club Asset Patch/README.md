﻿Creation Club Asset Patch
  
  
While the new assets from the several pieces of Creation Club content are usually very high quality, there also some that have several issues that have not been addressed by other mods so far. Creation Club Asset Patch attempts to fix these issues.
  
  
Alternative Armors - Iron﻿
  
There are cubemaps set up for all pieces of the Iron Plate set, however these do not actually show up due to incorrect material settings. The cubemaps are now correctly displayed.
  
  
Arcane Archer Pack
  
Fixes bad normals for the Bone Arrows.
  
  
Forgotten Seasons
  
﻿Fixes bad normals for the Wild Grass Pod plant.
  
  
Ghosts of the Tribunal
  
Removes the buggy, clipping sheath (just a very out-of-place copy of the Iron Sword sheath) from the Ebony Scimitar.
  
  
Headman's Cleaver
  
The filepath for the cubemap is broken, so the 1st person model
  
 shows up with an obvious purple sheen. This adjusts the filepaths and
  
material settings to make the 1st person model and 3rd person model
  
consistent.
  
  
Hendraheim
  
Fixes broken clutter assets.
  
  
Myrwatch
  
Fixes broken clutter assets.
  
  
Rare Curios
  
Most of the models in Rare Curios are completely fine, but there are still a couple issues. The first one concerns the Daedroth Teeth, which use the wrong filepath for the diffuse map. The second one is the Kreshfiber model, which lacks alpha properties, even though the texture is alpha mapped. This causes the model to have very nasty black edges where the alpha is supposed to be.
  
  
Shadowfoot Sanctum
  
Fixes broken clutter assets.
  
  
Tundra Homestead
  
Fixes broken clutter assets.
