Got permission from Krucify to port his original mod to Skyrim Special Edition.
  
This is different from the one uploaded by nekollx, because this is correctly ported: saved in CK and checked in SSEEdit and merged with some fields of USSEP.
  
  
Original mod: <https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/40400/>
  
  
Description:
  
  
All cases have been fixed in all three homes. Does not matter which wing you choose on which house.
  
I would recommend getting your weapons out of the ping pong pits before you add this file.
  
I am not responsible if the cases gobble up your weapons by not following directions.
  
  
Could conflict with other mods that add or change HearthFires homes.
  
Load it on top (maybe right after USSEP Patch).
  
  
Enjoy
