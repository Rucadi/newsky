Both [My Home is Your Home](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7096) as well as [MHIYH 2plus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20227?tab=description) come with a bug that can cause Actor Names to go blank. That in turn causes the activation prompt for the actor to disappear.
  
  
This was caused because the "use Stored Text" on the Alias was flagged to be active but no text was chosen. I simply removed the flag.
  
  
Q: Why is there no FOMOD?
  
A: I couldn't be bothered to make one.
