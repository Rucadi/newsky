**Overview**
  
Fixes a bug in My Home Is Your Home (MHIYH 2 Plus) that occurs when leveled characters are deleveled. In theses case, the NPC no longer receives a prompt when hovering over it with a cursor, meaning interaction with the NPC is no longer possible. 
  
  
The error can be reproduced when using [Flower Girls - Irresistible](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51481) without this fix. Use the Irresistible spell on any leveled NPC. Use the MHIYH prompt to allocate a home to the deleveled NPC. Then attempt to interact with the NPC. You'll no longer receive an interaction prompt (i.e. Use "E" to talk).
  
  
**UPDATE**: With version 1.1 the ESP has been ESLified, so it won't take up a slot in your load order. Thanks to Darklocq for pointing it out.
