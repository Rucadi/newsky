Details****Slaughterfish-Free Fast Travel**: Ever been stranded on the shores of Skyrim because a Slaughterfish *somewhere* in the water has its eyes on you? We've all been there—planning your next adventure, only to be thwarted by a fish with a grudge. Worse yet, they sometimes awkwardly flop onto the shore, giving you the side-eye while you wonder how to handle this slippery nuisance.This mod addresses two key frustrations from the base game:

  
1. **No More Fast Travel Blockages**: Slaughterfish are now less aggressive when you're not swimming, meaning they won't prevent you from fast traveling when you're safely on land. So, you can say goodbye to the dreaded "You cannot fast travel when enemies are nearby" message caused by some rogue fish out of sight.
**Enhanced Immersion**: These pesky fish now behave more naturally, staying underwater where they belong. No more awkward shore confrontations that break immersion—just a more seamless and lore-friendly experience in the world of Skyrim.
  

**Features:**

  
* **Uninterrupted Fast Travel**: Slaughterfish chill out when you're not swimming, allowing you to fast travel without interruptions from fishy foes.
**Lore-Friendly Behavior**: Maintains the challenge and authenticity of underwater encounters while ensuring Slaughterfish stay where they should—in the water.
  
* **Balanced Gameplay**: Keeps the Slaughterfish dangerous when they should be but prevents them from being an annoyance on land.
