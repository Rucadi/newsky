There is no plugin. This simply replaces the vanilla audio.
  
  
**[size=5]Fixes**
  
If you notice other splices that just sound bad, feel free to let me know and I can try to incorporate them sooner or later. The current set are just things that were annoying me recently.[/size]
  
  
**Adrianne Avenicci - Whiterun**
  
Adrienne's mentions of Eorlund Gray-Mane are bad and subject to clicks with too little spacing to make splicing easy (I'm not an audio engineer).

**Aela the Huntress - Whiterun**
  
Bad line, maybe spliced, with awkward emphasis on "you."

**Balgruuf - Whiterun**
  
Wonky pronunciation for "Don't," like it was spliced.

**Maramal - Temple of Mara**
  
Maramal's line during the wedding ceremony has a wonky pronunciation for "bound."

**Niranye - Windhelm**
  
There is a beep before the line and a pop at the end of the line "Thank you for your custom."
