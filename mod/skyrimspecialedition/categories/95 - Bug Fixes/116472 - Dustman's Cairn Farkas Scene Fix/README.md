Fixes an issue that caused the scene with Farkas in Dustman's Cairn during Proving Honor to not play properly.
  
  
**Changelog:**
  
*- Changed the placement of some NPCs and NPC markers in Dustman's Cairn
  
- All NPCs that are near the scene with Farkas now spawn after the scene is completed*
  
  
**Compatibility:**
  
*It only edits the placement of some NPCs and their markers. In my modlist of over 1600 mods, no mod conflicts with any of the changes made.*
  
  
  
The issue is documented in [UESP](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Proving_Honor): *"While inside the locked alcove trap, Farkas may not help you."*
  
This issue can be caused if the player aggroes an NPC outside of the area which then leads to Farkas chasing the NPCs as soon as the scene starts without being able to reliably reach them. This becomes more pronounced if you're using mods that increase the difficulty of sneaking.
