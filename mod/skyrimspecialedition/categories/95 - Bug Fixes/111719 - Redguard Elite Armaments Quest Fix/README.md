Fixes an issue that caused the quest to be unable to get started.
  
  
This is a very simple tweak to a dialogue line from Azadi to work regardless of your quest stage. I'm unsure what causes this issue in the first place but if you're unable to get the initial dialogue option from Azadi, this mod will fix that. (the mod will not magically fix anything other than that)
  
  
Since this issue seems somewhat widespread looking at [UESP](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Interception#Bugs) I decided to upload this fix. (Azadi may not initiate dialogue when speaking to him and will only respond in generic dialogue such as "Need something?" and "Huh?")
  
  
It is recommended to only use this mod if you encounter this issue.
