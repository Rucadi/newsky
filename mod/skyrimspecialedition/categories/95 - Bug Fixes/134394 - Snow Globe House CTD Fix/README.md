Apologize in advance, I'm not an English speaker, so I use a translation site.
  
Sorry if the explanation is not clear.
  
  
[Snow Globe House AE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/76973) is a great mod, but Alchemy House had a problem with the game crashing when approaching the pot.
  
Stone brick mesh under the pot turned out to be the cause, so replaced it with another object.
  
As something less incongruous, used stone bricks from the Palace of the Kings kitchen in the Windhelm instead.
  
This should have solved the problem.
  
  
I know not many people need it, but I fixed [Snow Globe House SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24461) too.
  
In addition to the same fixes as the AE version, also fixed a problem that caused the game to crash when the ring was equipped.
  
  
Overwrite the original esp.
