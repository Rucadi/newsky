Fixes the bone piles not having some textures on them.
  
  
  
  
uses some textures from [Skeleton Replacer HD - SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52845?tab=description) but is not required for this mod to work.
  
  
  
This way you don't have to download skeleton replacer HD and it's hidden requirement of SMIM or beast skeletons to fix the bone piles.
  
  
  
This mod works with [Praedy's Soul Cairn - SE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/66261?tab=description) as in you don't need the required Skeleton Replacer HD - SE mod as long as you have my mod, which covers the above mentioned other requirements. Just let this mod overwrite Praedy's Soul Cairn - SE.﻿
  
  
  
Credits to ﻿PraedythXVI for the textures.
  
  
Thanks to xanderheit for the amazing overhaul for Vigilant.
