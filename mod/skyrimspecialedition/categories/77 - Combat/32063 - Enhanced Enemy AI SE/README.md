**Description**
  
  
Enhanced Enemy AI is a lightweight script-free but effective enhancement to Skyrim combat, made by Erkeil.
  
If you are looking for a combat mod improving the Skyrim combat system without modifying other game settings, this mod might fits you! But its simplicity also makes it compatible with most popular combat mods.
  
  
All enemies from the base game + DLC (except dragons) have improved combat style, giving them the intelligence they were lacking.
  
Warriors bash, parry and power attack more often. If you're too defensive, they'll be more agressive and if you're too agressive, they won't hesitate to push you back.
  
Mages use more spells, especially defensive spells.
  
Animals adopt a more realistic behaviour, being more or less agressive depending of their species.
  
  
**The best way to figure if you may like the changes of this mod is to try it! Install it, rush into the closest bandits camp, instantly notice the difference!**
  
  

*I only recently began to play Skyrim SE and what was my suprise to notice that this gem hadn't still be ported.
  
It's my small contribution to the modding community! I hope you'll appreciate it!*

  
  
  
  
**Install / Uninstall**
  
  
This mod is a simple ESP. **You can install it and uninstall it at any time during your adventure.** 
  
Place EEAI directly in your data folder, or use your favorite mod manager.
  
If you decide to uninstall it, enemies will simply revert to the vanilla combat style of Skyrim (which isn't that great, let's admit it).
  
  
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
  
As this mod only edits combat style, it's compatible with 99% of all the Skyrim mods, and most combat mods.
  
The only conflicting mods are the ones I'm gonna list below. **Conflicting doesn't mean incompatible!** You will still be able to use your combat mods features while using Enhanced Enemy AI to improve combat style.
  
**Be sure to place this mod after/below your other combat mods in your load order!**
