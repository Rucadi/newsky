Minimal mod with no conflicts\* that works out of the box with controllers for Blocking while Dual Wielding weapons or Unarmed by using the right mouse button (replaces left attack), MCM options to toggle either Dual Wield or Unarmed Blocking and options for those only block when walking backwards.
  
  
This mod doesn't add blocking with staves or spells.
  
  
Things to note:
  
Dual Power Attack still works, and the Cross Attack by quick tapping both left and right mouse buttons still works.
  
Bashing with the left weapon doesn't apply enchants from the left weapon, Dual Power Attacks and Cross Attacks still apply enchants from the left weapon.
  
  
Requeriments
  
SkyUI only for the MCM
  
  
You can edit the mod defaults by editing the Global variables
  
it comes with Dual Wield and Unarmed Blocking enabled by default and Only Block Walking Back disabled for both.
