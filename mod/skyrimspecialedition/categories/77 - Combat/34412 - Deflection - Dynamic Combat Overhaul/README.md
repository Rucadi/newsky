There are a **TON** of great combat mods for Skyrim. Many of them add timed blocking, staggering or parrying mechanics as part of a bigger overhaul. While these mods are amazing, and add a ton of interesting game-play features, I felt I could design a mod based around timed blocking and staggering mechanics focused on allowing the user to customize the blocking/partying and staggering experience, which could then be used to enhance the features of other popular combat mods, or be used as a lightweight stand-alone combat mod.
  
  
Deflection is designed to be as performance friendly and customizable as possible, allowing you to setup the mod to match your personal taste. Just disable blocking or staggering features in other combat mods and let Deflection handle timed blocking and parrying.

Spell perk Item distributor is required for stagger settings.
  
  
No script stagger lock is recommended for stagger behavior settings. 
  
  
While not a requirement it is recommended that you use a mod that re-times the animation hit frames in order to make timed blocking more viable. This mod was designed around [Retimed Hit Frames](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26876) by [Wooph](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/459732)﻿ ﻿but any of [Mojikas](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/users/6733798)﻿ mods [Combat behavior Improved](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3568) ﻿, [Blocking combat behavior](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59487) all fix the hit frame timing in some way. Again not a requirement, but suggested for this mod to have the intended feel.
