Better Dragon Breath 4.0 changelog:
  
  
BUGFIXES:
  
  
•    Legendary Dragon no longer uses Alduin Voice when breathing fire.
  
  
AI: 
  
  
•    Dragons have a much higher chance of using their Fireball and Frost ball shouts when they are at long distance. 
  
•    Dragons will use both their breath, ball and drain vitality attacks much more smartly. They will be less idle between attacks, use them more frequently, and alternate between shouts better.
  
  
GRAPHICS:
  
  
•    Updated VFX.
  
•    Added light effect to frost ball.
  
•    Added a new custom projectile for Dragon Fireball (the same one I use in Fire and Blood).
  
  
AUDIO:
  
  
•    Included a new Audio Output and category, now the shouts sound with directionality, and you can lower their volume in your main menu. You can completely shut down the wording without affecting anything else.
  
  
GAMEPLAY:
  
  
•    Frost breath shouts can now properly slow the player (vanilla bugfix)
  
•    Reduced Fireball and Frost ball area by 5 feet.
  
•    Augmented taper duration in Fire breath and fireball.
  
•    Alduin’s fire breath and fireball have slightly higher taper duration than the other breaths.
  
•    Gave new VFX, explosions, and hazards to the storm call shout’s projectiles.
  
  
OPTIMIZATION:
  
  
•    Reduced performance impact.
  
•    Optimized firewall lights.
  
  
There's a new patch avaiable to use it with Fire and Blood in [Fire and Blood modpage.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/156018)﻿
  
  
THE MOD:[/left]TL DR---> WHAT THIS MOD DOES:
  
  
 ICE AND FIRE. EVERYWHERE. MANY EXPLOSIONS. Improved graphics, harder, and more impressive battles.**
  
  
¿Ever thought the dragons in this game can be a bit dissapointing once you (and the rest of the world along with you) leveled up a little?¿Ever thought the breath attacks of the dragons are just a bit *meh?*
  
  
Maybe you didn't. But if you did, this mod does exactly what the overview says: it **makes dragon's breath more impressive and deadly** in a very simple manner by taking a slightly different approach to the usual one of just augmenting the damage. **Now the breaths will have an area of effect,** which will make them dispatch the npcs faster or damage both the npcs and you, or both your companions andyou*.* Now the column of death that you see in your screen will actually be able to hit several characters standing next to each other; instead of being auto-aimed to one of them exclusively. The area of effect is similar to that of a fireball. This way the dragons will spend less time fighting only npcs and will be also a challenge to you ***(also the npcs will die, I recommend installing [Run for your lives](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2272) along with this mod so the victims are mostly guards/soldiers).***
  
This effect is accompanied with **visual effects**, now both breaths **will look and sound more explosive** and powerful when hitting the ground (kind of like Drogon's breath in Game of Thrones). They will also get some lighting effects when the dragons exhale their deadly beams at you.
  
And finally, they will also **generate fire or frost surfaces** when they impact, similarly to "wall of fire" or "wall of ice" destructive spells. ﻿

This will also add an element of strategy to the fight, and also yes, **it will make it more difficult,** more deadly, and more impressive. ***BE SURE THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT!!!!***On the other hand, the ball like long range attacks will just have a massive area of effect (3x the diameter of a fireball). Theese attacks were kind of weak, now they will have some utility even if the normal breath will still be more powerful. Also, the fireball attack recieved an FX makeover.
  
  

Here is in game footage of both Fire and a Frost dragon fighting.

 ***Here is a showcase of a full dragon fight versus a dragon added by mods (Diverse dragons collection's Needlehide Dragon), with the patch and the custom effects I made applied. This video also showcases Majestic Dragons Mole 2.0 and Better and realistic dragon melee 2.2***If you are wondering why the dragons are so atonishingly huge and good looking, it is becase I'm also using my other mod [Majestic dragons,](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120239) and of course [GOT HOTD DDC.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/83718)﻿
  
  
**INSTALLATION: PLUG AND PLAY.**

  
1. Op1: Use mod manager option and install it with your mod manager (vortex or mod organizer, I use [mod organizer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194)﻿)
Op 2: Paste the content of the 7zip in game's data directory in the game's installation folder.﻿

WARNING: INSTALL/LOAD ALL FILES AFTER ALL OF YOUR OTHER DRAGON GAMEPLAY MODS; INCLUDING DEADLY DRAGONS AND DIVERSE DRAGONS COLLECTION; OTHERWISE THEY WILL OVERWRITE THE BREATH CHANGES.
  
  
REQUIREMENTS: NONE. You only need Skyrim Special Edition.[/left]**

**EXTRAS:**

  
Lightweight and ESL flagged it, so it won't take a plugin slot. The performance impact will depend on your imax ini setting, how many VFX enhancers you have active and your ENB or CS configuration, if you use them. It should be perfectly manageable however.
  
  

**COMPATIBILITY:**

  
I always try to keep things simple and compatible. If you think you ***need*** dragon combat overhaul or deadly dragons with this, don't worry, it will be compatible. **You must load it after** and overwrite the conflicting files with those mods, however. It, of course, will also be compatible with anything that alters the look of your dragons, and also with **[dragon breath vfx mods like this one](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/118431)**, which I recommend.
  
  

  
* ***1.2: Added a patch for diverse dragons collection breaths!*** *To cover all dragons, you need both mods, if you only install the DDC patch you will be missing the fire and frost breaths. Also ESL flagged.*
***1.3: Added a patch for deadly dragons !** You need both the main file and the patch to play with deadly dragons. You can use deadly dragons and diverse dragons  collection together, for that to work you need the main file and the two optional ones.* 
  
* ***2.0: Added a patch for Dragon war!***
***2.4: Made a patch for Dragons use thu'um!*** The effects I made will apply to Dragon Use Thu'ums' fire and frost dragon attacks. Check that mod, it's awesome! You need both [Dragons use Thu'um](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/87085)﻿ and Better Dragon Breath main files, and this one must be loaded after them.
  

Hope you enjoy your dragon battles!
