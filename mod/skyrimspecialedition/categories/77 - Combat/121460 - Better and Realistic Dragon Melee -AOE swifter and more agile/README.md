- Author: Lucaoys

[left]**3.01:
  
  
Added combat styles /behaviour edits that will make dragons less idle between attacks, bolder, and more agressive in general. Updated the more ground combat misc file (yout must load that one after the main mod)
  
  
UPDATE 3.0 - MOD OVERHAULED!
  
  
GAMEPLAY:**

  
1. **The mod is overhauled. Now dragons will knock down the NPCs when taking off and landing as well. However, you can block this effect by blocking or using wards. Become ethereal will also prevent it from happening.**
**The same goes for the melee attacks, you can block the knock down effect if you defend. Before this was impossible.**
  
2. **The system is inspired by Fire and Blood, but is intentionally kept lighter, less complex, and more modular for maximum compatibility.**
**The Alternate “No KD” file now removes all knockdowns on the player except when a dragon physically lands on top of you. Even in that version, blocking/wards/ethereal still prevent the effect.**
  
3. **The added AOE damage can now be resisted with high armor values.**

**VFX**

  
1. **Now the blood explosion will play with all melee attacks, but only when a hit event is performed (No more blood appearing when a dragon misses its attack).**
**All attacks that hit will generate larger blood decals than before (very noticeable).**
  
2. **Bite and tail attacks now apply a bloody hit shader to struck NPCs. This reveals the true AOE of each attack and makes hits feel far more brutal and physical.**
**Taking off and landing animations will now trigger big dust effects and screen shaking. The vanilla game tried to do something similar to this with dragonactorscript, but that one doesn't work most of the time in leveled list dragons.**
  

  
Overall, this update removes the “amateurish” feel of older versions and turns the mod into a modern melee system for dragons, where:
  
  

  
* Timing
Positioning
  
* Blocking
Combat awareness
  

  
...actually matter
  
  
Dragons hit hard; but now the player has meaningful, skill-based defensive options.

THIS MOD IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH FIRE AND BLOOD; IT IS EITHER ONE OR THE OTHER
  
  
The mod:**[/left]
  
¿Ever felt the dragons are a bit derpy when moving on land or when attacking? They fail rather often, get stuck, and have a rather hard time closing distance and hitting targets at times. Also, it is a bit weird that such huge creatures can not damage two or more creatures standing right next to each other. All their bite, wing, and tail attacks, could only damage a single target in vanilla.
  
  
To make it worse, the tail attack only applies in one segment of the tail (corresponding to the tip); so it just appears to fail all the time, and the stagger area didn't always apply correctly.
  
  
This mod tries to fix all of that with speed and acceleration tweaks, now dragons will be more agile.
  
  
It also significantly buffs the tail and wing attacks, giving them AOE damage ,stagger, and improved hit effects (more blood and mud will appear in your screen). This means the dragon will spend less time attacking the npcs and ignoring you, since they will be able to dispatch the npcs quicker, and harm both the npcs and you. The bite, tail attacks and wing attacks cover a wider angle.
  
  
The AOE the dragons deal is perfecly scaled according to character and NPCs' level, so it won't be overpowered at the start of the game, and will remain noticiable when you reach a high level. 
  
  
The mod also adds a new fight mechanic: you can negate the effects of the AOE and knock downs by defeinding (either blocking with a shield or weapon, using a magical ward, or becoming ethereal). You can also hide behind cover, something that wasn't posible in the first iterations of the mod.
  
  

  
* **BITE ATTACKS** : The bite attack will be able to hit enemies that stand very close and stagger them in a slightly larger area.

* **WING AND TAIL ATTACKS:** The wing and tail attacks will have larger area of effect; they will stagger in a large area, and damage and knock down in a moderate one. You can negate this effect by using wards or absorbing , and blocking with your shield, or well, staying away.

  

**Vanilla wing attack:**

**DRAGON TAKE OFF,  LANDING, AND FLY BY PHYSICS:**When dragons perform all this actions they will knock down the NPCs and stagger; you can negate this effects blocking , using a magical ward, or becoming ethereal.**Warning: You can get knocked down rather easily.** If you want this mechanic to be more forgiving, [install this to get up much faster.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46714)﻿I suggest installing it anyway because I find how slow the get up animation is so annoying.
  
  
There is **an optional file that removes most of the area knock downs** for you, the protagonist!... Only the landing one will remain, and you can still block it, of course.
  
  
But they will still affect the npcs. Of course they will still be able to  deal some area of effect damage and stagger you, though, so be careful. **This file is standalone; you only need either it or the original version.** 
  
  
Dragons will feel like intimidating and huge creatures, their mass and imposing size and legend will be felt in every movement they make. They will feel like the heralds of the end of the world that only you, the dovahkiin, can stop! Also, if a dragon approaches you, don't walk back wards ***turn back and run, or it will catch you.
  
  
ADITIONAL CHANGES:***

  
* **Changes to Dragon Class so dragons prioritize getting more health when leveling up.**
**Changes to dragon's movement type, they will be faster in land, have advanced avoidance, and also will be able to lateral walk. All this will help them to get stuck less frequently.**
  

  
* This mod was made with [majestic dragons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120239) proportions in mind, since the dragons are larger and definately benefit from wider hit angles and AOE, which feels a lot more coherent. But it will also work with vanilla proportions; the dragons will feel fiercer in combat and will be able to deal with more enemies at once.
This is an excelent complement to [Better Dragon Breath.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/121210?tab=description) Now dragons will fight better and cause a massive carnage in everyway!
  

  
This mod will add an element of strategy to the fight, and also yes, **it will make it more difficult,** more deadly, and more impressive. ***BE SURE THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT!!!!*** ***.Also the npcs will die, I recommend installing [Run for your lives](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2272) along with this mod so the victims are mostly guards/soldiers.
  
  

Here is a video showcasing the melee attacks:
  
  
v 2.0***

**Extras:**Lightweight, with no permormance impact. It is an ESL, so it won't count towards your plugin limit!***.***

**Compatibility:**
  
Should be compatible with most stuff (mesh replacers, HD textures, mods that add extra dragons like diverse dragons collection, majestic dragons, better dragon breath, dragon breath VFX...) but if you use combat mods, and you like what this mod does and want to make sure it applies, make sure to load it after everything.
