**Realistic Weapon Swing Pace**
  
-NPCs no longer swing their weapons with machine-like speed.
  
Each attack phases is more clear:
  
- weapon wind-up
  
- swing weapon 
  
- end lag (post-swing recovery)
  
  
**Smarter Combat Flow**
  
NPCs will now wind up their attacks more slowly than Orign BFCO/MCO,
  
execute the swing at variable speeds (*Random Mode Only*, fixed mode do more faster swing),
  
and experience longer end lag depending on their Animation.
  
This makes their behavior less robotic,
  
and giving you more tactical windows to react, parry, or counterattack—no more universal weapon masters among your enemies!
  
  
**Human NPC-Only**
  
This mod focuses on Human NPC weapon attacks.
