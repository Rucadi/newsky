This is a fork of my [Ordinator Distributor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42022) with added support for Vokrii and thus Vokriinator. While it can be used with the black edition, it would lack the perks of the other 3 perk mods. ~~You may want to try [THIS](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16bAizw9lQrV6Y0TKYDdCJWLzMwiPdXcp/view) file instead for the black edition!~~ Black edition version no longer available for the time being it would seem.
  
  
What it does:
  
  
(Main) Regular:
  

  
* Condition: There are 4 conditions for actors to check - Keywords for NPC and Undead as well as 5 classes to cover falmer and Attronach races. This should cover the majority of actors available that would benefit from perks.
Condition: Perks will ONLY be distributed when the actor reaches a certain skill level - just like the player does.
  
* Chance: The ACTUAL chance of perks being distributed is 10/25/50/75/100 % for each perk once the above conditions are met - choosable during installation.

  
(Main) No followers:
  

  
* Same as the regular version with the exception that followers are excluded which is done by checking for the "Teammate" trait..

  
(Optional) Followers Only:
  

  
* The skill requirements stay the same as in the regular version, but only recruitable NPCs will be included as well as them having a guaranteed distribution once their skill level is met.

  
  
Installation:
  

  
* Just extract the .rar file anywhere and pick ONE of the two "regular" folders (the first includes all the actors - the second excludes followers) and drop the "Vokriinator Perks for NPCs\_DISTR.ini" file into your data folder, like a normal plugin. (Where your Vokriinator.esp is located) Optionally you may also install the "followers only" version which ONLY impacts followers.
Installation/uninstallation/Updating can be done at any point mid-play due to the way SPID works.
  

  
  
Known Issues:
  

  
* Nether's Follower Framework does not show the perks, but they are there - same is true with other mod added perks. use [More Informative Console](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19250)﻿ instead to see all the perks!
