> **Sanguine Symphony transforms Skyrim's combat into a more visceral, intense, and satisfying experience.**
>   
>   
> **The entire impact system has been completely reworked** to dynamically respond to the target's remaining health, the weapon used, armor worn, hit location, and many other factors. A unique **dynamic blood spray system** has also been implemented. **Insects and Dwemer automatons** now benefit from dedicated and varied visual effects (which you're free to enable or disable).
>   
>   
> **A wide selection of HD textures for blood splatters and wounds** enhances immersion without betraying the game's aesthetic, while remaining fully compatible with your retexture mods. Just like the impact system, these textures automatically vary based on the target's remaining health and the weapon type used.
>   
>   
> Sanguine Symphony also offers optional **slow-motion effects and targeted physical impulses** to simulate pressure on the struck body part. Additionally, a system **dynamically adjusts body weight based on equipped gear**, making ragdoll reactions more realistic and diverse.
>   
>   
> Everything is **fully configurable via an MCM menu**, for a tailored experience.

A complete revamp of combat feedback thanks to the [Core Impact Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/146873), which drives all visual and sound effects based on weapon type, armor worn, hit location, and more. Every hit feels punchy, responsive, and immersive. Over 80 new weapon- and armor-specific sounds greatly enhance the auditory experience.

Procedural 3D blood effects that adapt to the intensity and direction of each hit, whether on humanoids, insects, or Dwemer automatons. This feature is highly customizable via the mod's MCM menu.

High-resolution textures for blood splatters and wounds (now matching the weapon type used), fully compatible with any retexture or visual enhancement mod.

Every feature is fully customizable via a clear, intuitive MCM interface. If you use the MCM Helper mod, your settings will persist across game sessions. The mod is also localized and translated into all languages officially supported by the game.

All features are implemented directly through the game engine. No scripts are used, ensuring maximum performance with no overhead.

Sanguine Symphony is designed to integrate smoothly into any modded setup. It's entirely standalone, doesn't replace any base game files, and won't conflict with other mods. You can install it worry-free, no matter your mod list.

Built with CommonLibSSE-NG, the mod works flawlessly on all versions of Skyrim: AE, SE, and VR.

To work, this mod will need the following mods installed:
  
  

* [Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE64)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30379)
[Address Library for SKSE Plugins](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444)
  
* [SkyUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12604) (to configure the mod through the MCM)
The [Core Impact Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/146873) (optional, but without it you will not be able to enjoy all the features of the mod)
  

  
I also **recommend** installing the excellent "[Precision](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72347)" mod, which adds a lot of dynamism to combat and pairs perfectly with Sanguine Symphony.
  
  
Of course, all [my other mods](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Seb263/mods?gameId=1704&sortBy=createdAt) related to combat mechanics are compatible and recommended to further enhance the experience.

The mod can be installed like any other mod via a mod manager or manually.
  
  
**Manual Installation :**
  
Spoiler1. Download the latest version of the mod.
  
2. Open the archive using [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org) or [Winrar](https://www.win-rar.com).
  
3. Place the **entire contents** of the archive into the **"Data" folder** of your game.
  
(Default: C:\Program Files\Steam\Steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition\Data)
  
4. Activate "Sanguine Symphony.esp" from the game's mod manager (or any other mod manager).
  
5. Launch Skyrim and envoy!

಄ Does the mod alter the damage system?
  
No, the mod does not aim to alter combat difficulty. Its only goal is to enhance the visual and aesthetic aspects of combat.
  
  
಄ Can the mod cause slowdowns?
  
No, the mod is designed for high performance and won't cause slowdowns, as everything runs in real-time via the game engine.
  
  
಄ Does the mod work with all versions of the game?
  
Yes, the mod works without issues on any version of the game, including VR.
  
  
಄ I use Enhanced Blood Textures (EBT), what should I do?
  
The most logical choice is to uninstall it, because:
  

* **If you're using the LITE version,** you'll never actually see EBT's textures, since Sanguine Symphony applies a broader and more varied set of its own textures. Plus, this version of EBT replaces a vanilla texture (which it ends up never displaying), potentially causing visual issues when the [Core Impact Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/146873) tries to use it.
**If you're using the FULL version,** you'll likely experience inconsistencies, as it forcibly adds blood to every impact, which directly conflicts with Sanguine Symphony's logic-driven blood spray system.
  

**TL;DR:** I recommend uninstalling EBT. However, if you choose to keep it, just be aware that visual inconsistencies may occur.
  
  
಄ Which mods are incompatible with Sanguine Symphony?
  
***Strictly speaking, none. But let me clarify.** I prefer to talk about inconsistencies rather than true incompatibilities. The following mods won’t cause errors or serious conflicts when used with Sanguine Symphony. However, they may interfere with the cohesive impact system I designed to reflect a very specific vision of combat. You're free to include them if they align with your preferences, but please note that I won’t be offering support or compatibility patches for these combinations.*
  
  

* [Cinematic Kills Plus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68513)
[Dynamic Impacts](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/140320)
  
* [Dynamic Impact – Slash Effects X](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86071)
[Dynamic (Locational) Armor and Weapon Impacts](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/147847)
  
* More broadly, this concerns CIF-based mods that perform a full overhaul of impact effects, similar to Sanguine Symphony, and make heavy use of ImpactMapping entries (HitMapping entries are not affected).

಄ Aside from the listed mods, are my other mods compatible?
  
Yes, Sanguine Symphony should be compatible with absolutely all your other mods, without exception.
  
  
಄ I'm experiencing a crash:
  
First, confirm that it's related to Sanguine Symphony by checking your crash log (look for SanguineSymphony in the header).
  
If confirmed, use the Bug tab to report the issue. Please provide both your crash log and the content of the SanguineSymphony.log file (located in Documents\My Games\Skyrim Special Edition\SKSE).
