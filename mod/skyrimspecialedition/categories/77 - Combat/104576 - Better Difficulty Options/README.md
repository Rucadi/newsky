**[font=Verdana]Description:[/font]**
  
  
Adds extra gameplay elements to the difficulty sliders. Spells cost more, Stamina/Magicka regen slower in combat, Sneak attacks deal less damage, Stamina/Magicka have a longer delay until they regenerate and enemies scale higher.
  
  
It makes the higher difficulties actually harder instead of just damage sponges out of enemies.
  
  
Default values are based on vanilla Skyrim. I may make patches for some mods changing those defaults

The values above are modifiers. For Stamina regeneration in combat it means the higher the difficulty, the slower your Stamina regenerates.

Normalised difficulty setting in favor of my own, perk based, damage reduction/increase
  
optional file to normalise those perks as well, so every difficulty means damage taken/dealt is always the same
  
uses my [other mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120521) as framework
  
having difficulty set by perks has the advantage of seeing the actual weapon damage reduction in the inventory menu
  
i know that this leaves something similar to vanilla's damage sponges, so if you don't want that, use the optional file where everything shown below is set to 100%

Should be safe to update mid-game, but check your save with ReSaver to be sure.
  
  
**[font=Verdana]Install:[/font]**
  
  
whenever
  
  
[font=Verdana]**Uninstall:**[/font]
  
  
Whenever but it has scripts, so you gotta make sure the scripts are gone afterwards
  
  
[font=Verdana]**Incompatibilities:**[/font]
  
Blade and Blunt's dynamic difficulty setting.
  
it's a soft incompatibility due to me setting all difficulty related gameplay settings to 1.0 and blade and blunt dynamically changes it at certain levels.
  
to make both mods compatible, turn that off in blade and blunt's ini setting or leave it and use my optional file to turn the perk based damage modifiers off.
