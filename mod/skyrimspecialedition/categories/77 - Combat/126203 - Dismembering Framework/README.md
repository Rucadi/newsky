> **The Dismembering Framework enhances Skyrim's combat with a real-time dismemberment system** that integrates **realistic blood splatters** and **adaptive sound effects** based on armor and weapon types. Unlike traditional mods that rely on scripted delays, **this mod operates directly through the game engine**, providing a seamless and immersive experience. Fans of the **Fallout series** will recognize a similar dismemberment feel, but with enhanced realism and integration tailored specifically for Skyrim.
>   
>   
> **NPCs and creatures can also engage in dismemberment interactions**, adding depth to combat scenarios. The **MCM menu** offers extensive customization options, including **bullet time effects**, **dismemberment conditions**, and **blood splatter settings**. If you have the **MCM Helper** mod installed, your settings will be preserved across game sessions.
>   
>   
> The framework is designed to **integrate smoothly with other mods**, including those that alter character models or gameplay mechanics, ensuring an enhanced experience without causing conflicts or performance issues.

Here are some of the key features of the Dismembering Framework:

Unlike other mods that rely on Papyrus scripts, this mod performs dismemberments in real-time directly through the engine, eliminating perceptible delays and ensuring a smooth, immersive experience without the usual script lag.
  
  
![](https://www.seb263.fr/mods/skyrim/_shared/alt/chip_05.svg?height=22&mt=6&mb=6) ![](https://www.seb263.fr/mods/skyrim/dismembering_framework/img/standalone_game_integration.svg?height=22&mt=9)
  
The Framework is completely independent of the base game, making it immune to internal or external conflicts.
  
  
![](https://www.seb263.fr/mods/skyrim/_shared/alt/chip_05.svg?height=22&mt=6&mb=6) ![](https://www.seb263.fr/mods/skyrim/dismembering_framework/img/universal_mod_support.svg?height=22&mt=9)
  
Compatible with modifications to meshes, textures, and character skeletons. There are no compatibility issues with armors, skins, or other mods.
  
  
![](https://www.seb263.fr/mods/skyrim/_shared/alt/chip_05.svg?height=22&mt=6&mb=6) ![](https://www.seb263.fr/mods/skyrim/dismembering_framework/img/comprehensive_limb_severing.svg?height=22&mt=9)
  
NPCs can dismember each other, and the player can also be dismembered, depending on the chosen settings.
  
  
![](https://www.seb263.fr/mods/skyrim/_shared/alt/chip_05.svg?height=22&mt=6&mb=6) ![](https://www.seb263.fr/mods/skyrim/dismembering_framework/img/accurate_limb_severing.svg?height=22&mt=9)
  
If you use the "Precision" mod (which you should), limbs are severed precisely according to the targeted area, enhancing the impact of fatal attacks.
  
  
![](https://www.seb263.fr/mods/skyrim/_shared/alt/chip_05.svg?height=22&mt=6&mb=6) ![](https://www.seb263.fr/mods/skyrim/dismembering_framework/img/cutting-edge_blood_and_sound_design.svg?height=22&mt=9)
  

  
* **Dynamic Blood Splatter:** Realistic blood splatters with physics are expelled from severed limbs until the body is drained.
**Bullet Time, Visual and Sound Effects:** Optionally, you can slow down time momentarily during dismemberment. "Cinematic" sounds can also be played.
  
* **Armor and Weapon-Specific Impact Sounds:** A variety of impact sounds tailored to the armor and weapons used during dismemberment.
**Severed Limb Impulse Effects:** Realistic (or not, your choice) projection of severed limbs for a more cinematic effect.

All features are fully configurable through the MCM, offering detailed control over actor types, dismemberment chances, weapons, and more. If you use the MCM Helper mod, your settings will persist across game sessions.
  
  
![](https://www.seb263.fr/mods/skyrim/_shared/alt/chip_05.svg?height=22&mt=6&mb=6) ![](https://www.seb263.fr/mods/skyrim/dismembering_framework/img/community-friendly.svg?height=22&mt=9)
  
The framework is designed to evolve with surrounding mods. Modders can create their own assets if desired, and there's no need to add a dependency on the Dismembering Framework for this.

Thanks to the continuous improvements of CommonLibSSE-NG by the talented community, this mod benefits from its advantages and is thus compatible with all game versions.

This mod **requires [Skyrim Script Extender (SKSE64)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30379) to be installed** (any version) and [Address Library for SKSE Plugins](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444) in order to function.
  
  
You'll also need [SkyUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12604) to configure the mod through the MCM.
  
  
I also **recommend** installing the excellent "[Precision](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72347)" mod, which adds a lot of dynamism to combat and pairs perfectly with Dismembering Framework.
  
  
Although the framework is completely independent, **it still requires instruction files** (.json) to know what to do. **These files are provided with the asset packs.** Typically, the assets are the visual replicas of the severed limbs. Therefore, **it is necessary to install at least one of these packs** to see the framework in action.
  
  
I recommend the two "official" asset packs I created alongside the framework, which will be **regularly updated to eventually cover all base game assets**:

Feel free to search for specific asset packs. Someone might have created one!

The mod can be installed like any other mod via a mod manager or manually. Asset packs follow the same procedure.
  
⚠ **Note: The framework alone does not provide any dismemberment! Please use at least one asset pack to benefit from its features.**
  
  
**Manual Installation :**
  
Spoiler1. Download the latest version of the mod.
  
2. Open the archive using [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org) or [Winrar](https://www.win-rar.com).
  
3. Place the **entire contents** of the archive into the **"Data" folder** of your game.
  
(Default: C:\Program Files\Steam\Steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition\Data)
  
4. Activate "Dismembering Framework.esm" from the game's mod manager (or any other mod manager).
  
5. Launch Skyrim and envoy!

಄ Does the mod alter the damage system?
  
No, the framework does not aim to alter the combat difficulty. Currently, actors will only be dismembered if their health reaches zero (or if they are already dead).
  
  
಄ Can the mod cause slowdowns?
  
No, the mod is designed to be performant and does not cause slowdowns, as all operations are handled in real-time via the game engine. Resource loading occurs asynchronously at game launch, preventing any lag.
  
  
಄ Does the mod work with all versions of the game?
  
Yes, the mod will work without issues on any version of the game, including VR.
  
  
಄ Is the mod compatible with visual mods?
  
Yes, the mod is compatible with all visual mods. Default textures for blood splatters will be replaced with the ones you use, ensuring smooth integration with existing retextures.
  
  
಄ What types of armor can be sliced?
  
All armors, including those from mods, can be sliced without needing specific patches (though asset packs are recommended for more realism).
  
  
಄ Is the mod compatible with modified skeletons (e.g., XPMSSE)?
  
Yes, it will adapt without issues to any type of skeleton without conflicts.
  
  
಄ Is the mod compatible with other mods of the same kind (e.g., Maximum Carnage)?
  
Officially, no, and I do not plan to create a patch for this. Unofficially, the framework's nature means it is compatible with anything you might use, so you can try your luck without too much concern. However, be aware that this may negatively impact your gaming experience and retain inherent issues from other mods (e.g., effect delays).
  
  
಄ My game crashes during a decapitation.
  
This crash could be related to a bug in the overlay function of the RaceMenu mod, or caused by faulty FaceGen data installed for certain NPCs. I created a mod aimed at fixing all decapitation-related crashes in the base game, and it is fully compatible with the Dismembering Framework.
  
**Feel free to check it out: [Next-Gen Decapitations](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/135254)**
  
  
಄ I am experiencing a crash or a specific issue:
  
In that case, please refer to the instructions provided in the pinned message in the comments section.
  
  
[font=Tahoma,sans-serif]಄ What's the difference between Simple Beheading and the Dismembering Framework?
  
[**Simple Beheading**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/117172) **is a straightforward mod that focuses exclusively on humanoid head decapitations**. It's lightweight, doesn't require an ESP plugin, and reuses the game's existing decapitation function with minimal setup. On the other hand, the **Dismembering Framework is a much more advanced system**. It allows dismemberment of various body parts beyond just heads, offering a deeper and more dynamic combat experience. If you're looking for expanded functionality, Dismembering Framework is the way to go.[/font]
  
***[ TLDR: DON'T use Simple Beheading with the Dismembering Framework ]***

**Many of you have suggested pushing the features even further, and I've taken note of your ideas.**
  
  
It's clear that **this initial version of the framework is just the starting point for more exciting features**. Future possibilities include torso-level dismemberments, live dismembering (which means localized damage), skull crushing, and other monstrous additions.
  
  
If these interest you, they will be proposed and discussed on my Patreon (once again, everything developed on this platform will be released on Nexus once completed).

*“ [size=3][i]I'm a modder and I'm interested in the framework!* ”[/i][/size]

  
Happy to hear that! Before diving into specifics, there are **two scenarios** to consider:
  
  
᯽ You want to adapt an armor to create custom limb assets (the most likely case).
  
In this case, the process should be straightforward. Import the pre-designed assets from the official humanoid pack to integrate your armor parts, then re-export everything to your desired directory. You will just need to create the formIDs in the CK (which takes no more than 2 minutes) and link them to the framework by creating two JSON files.
  
  
**To learn more:**
  
    [? Consult the documentation on designing JSON files](https://www.seb263.fr/mods/skyrim/dismembering_framework/doc/json.html)
  
    [? Download the archive containing a sample related to the documentation](https://www.seb263.fr/mods/skyrim/dismembering_framework/doc/TutoLimb_1.0.0.zip)
  
  
᯽ You want to make something dismemberable that isn't (for now!).
  
In this case, it's highly recommended to be familiar with the first scenario to understand how the framework works. However, modeling work will be required. Some proficiency with Blender will be necessary to design these assets. You will need to import the model to be dismembered and its skeleton, then make cuts at the bone level. Node positions must be projected during export so the severed limb appears precisely where it should. It's impossible to document everything here, but like the first scenario, I'll try to provide examples and source files. A complete tutorial could be considered if there's enough demand.
  
  
In the meantime, topics will be opened in the forum tab for you to ask any questions. I will do my best to assist you.
  
  
᯽ You want to integrate the Dismembering Framework into an SKSE Plugin.
  
  
For experienced modders looking to extend the Dismembering Framework via SKSE, the API provides a set of essential functions through the API.h file. These allow direct interaction with the dismemberment system, offering control over limb detachment, state checks, and updates.
