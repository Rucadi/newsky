[left]After learning that most of the mods I loved the most were slowly corrupting my save I decided to try and find some mods that meaningfully changed the gameplay without contributing to long-term decay and save bloat.[/left]
  
Unfortunately, I couldn't find enough to make for a worthwhile modding experience.
  
  
What I eventually found out was that SPID and Skypatcher were perfect for this because nothing they do is ever added to your save file so that means they can't contribute to long-term decay or save bloat.
  
  
In my hopes of getting through a long playthrough with mods I decided to create a series of mods with SPID and Skypatcher. This mod is the result of that attempt and it eventually turned out pretty well.
  
  
**Introducing Fortunate Foes**
  
  
I'm a big fan of the Shadow Of Mordor series and how the game randomizes character perks and I wanted a way to bring that sort of variability to combat in Skyrim.
  
  
The perks in this mod are distributed to enemies in the Draugr, Bandit, Forsworn, Vampire, and Falmer factions.
  
  
The distribution filter is based on chance, skill level, and skill weight. Skill weight is the way the game determines a character's focus as they level up. So if they have a skill weight of 2 in One handed, for example, that means that they have a strong focus in melee combat and are illegible to receive certain melee based perks. However, that doesn't mean that they will receive very many if any perks at all.
  
  
The distribution system is designed to vary combat rather than just load up enemy NPCs with perks. So it's more about each character having a different feel rather than making them OP. This mod is designed in such a way that you get natural spikes in difficulty that increase in frequency the longer you play.
  
  
I would adjust your difficulty settings accordingly.
  
  
Spoiler[left]**Fortunate Foes 5 – Perk List**[/left]
  
**Level 10–25 Perks (vs. Level 40+ Targets)**
  
  
These perks are meant to unlock once the player reaches level 40. They are designed to give overpowered players a jolt without making enemies feel overpowered. NPCs who are between level 10-25 get perks that only apply to target's that are at level 40 or above. These perks each pack a lot of punch but they are either conditional or have a small chance of triggering to keep things balanced. You'll lose a little bit more health than you were expecting and then you'll be more careful. These perks are not designed to be unfair or overwhelm the player. They are meant to vary the combat gameplay in a way that keeps the game feeling fresh over a long playthrough.
  
  
These perks make enemies below level 25 much stronger when the player reaches level 40, but not before then.
  
  
Applies only to NPCs between level 10–25 when fighting targets level 40+.

**Note:** *By default, around 50% of eligible enemy types have a chance to receive a few of these perks. They are distributed using a complex and balanced algorithm.*
  
  
**156 Combat Styles**
  
  
These are the default combat styles in the complete edition. I use [Tactical NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/134600) with Fortunate Foes Core instead. The combat styles from this mod are still pretty good, but follow a different philosophy for the bandits. Bandits using combat styles from Tactical NPCs have much better group tactical behavior and are consistently attempting to flank targets and attack from multiple angles. The downside with those changes is that the bandits using combat styles from Tactical NPCs sacrifice their survivability as individuals in order to try and flank the target for the sake of the group. It can be kind of risky to try and maneuver around the target to get to their back or side.**Installation**

  
1. **Required Mods**:
     
     
   * SPID (Spell Perk Item Distributor)

Ensure SPID is installed and running.
  
* Optional: Edit the provided

  ```
  Aptitude_DISTR.ini
  ```

    
   file to adjust the percentage of Fortunate Foes that spawn.

  
2. **Customization**:
     
     
   * Open the

     ```

    keyword.

[line]
  
  
Uninstall
  
  
This mod contains (ESL flagged) ESPs. None of them should be uninstalled mid-game unless you know what you are doing. It has no scripts. You can disable or delete the file called Aptitiude\_DISTR.ini (or any of the DISTR.ini files related to this mod) if you don't like what the mod is doing in your game, instead of removing the ESP. Disable the file by changing the extension to something other than ini.
  
  
Delete or change the file extension of the following files to remove the new enemies injected into the leveled list:
  
\Data\SKSE\Plugins\Skypatcher\leveledlist\FortunateVariants.esp.ini
  
  
Delete or change the file extension of the following files to remove the combat styles:
  
\Data\SKSE\Plugins\Skypatcher\npc\Lifelikecombat.esp.ini
  
  
*Deleting/Renaming the ini files means that no NPCs, perks, or combat styles remain in your game and none of them were ever in your save file.*
  
  
Versions
  
  
**Fortunate Foes Core Edition**
  
  
The core edition is now the recommended way to play. Fortunate Foes Core + Tactical NPCs + Mythic Conjurers
  
  
**Additional Bandit Types**
  
  
Adds 5 different bandit types to the bandit leveled lists. I use Skypatcher to inject these bandits into the
  
leveled list.
  
  
Bandit Spellsword
  
Bandit Spellblade
  
Bandit Hackblade
  
Bandit Bulwark
  
Bandit Void
  
  
I ripped this from the complete edition because at the time the Bulwark and Hackblade classes didn't stand out as being particularly formidable in combat. A little combat style tweak made a big difference. And now I've added the Bandit Void class, which is now the strongest, and it also gives a visual indicator which adds to the gameplay.
  
  
**Mythic Conjurers**
  
  
I think that distributing perks to mages (or any ranged enemies) would basically destroy the balance of the game. There is just no way to balance the burst damage they would do and it would basically make mage combat too unbalanced. But a single Warlock type provides a reasonable difficulty spike. These conjurers have access to conjuration spells that most NPCs don't have access to in the game and it makes for more variety when it comes to mage combat.
  
  
Compatibility
  
  
This mod won't conflict with anything. 
  
  
**Mods That Remove Low Level Enemies**This mod makes it so the lower-mid level enemies adapt as the player's level increases making the difficulty curve increase sharply. Using something like Arena that gets rid of lower level enemies would actually decrease the difficulty.
  
  
  
**Is the 156 combat styles add-on compatible with skytactics?**
  
  
*> No, those combat styles are my take on Skytactics. The reason why I created it is because I felt like Skytactic's combat styles are varied but, similar in intensity. They all have their values turned up, just different variations. The result of that is that every encounter is of a similar intensity. With my combat styles I wanted to introduce a sort of chance element. With each encounter you have between a 20-33% chance of the enemy rolling a combat style that is on par with the original game's combat style difficulty, a 33-66% chance to roll a combat style that is elite, and the rest somewhere in between. Your chances depend on the type of enemy you are facing.*
  
**Is the 156 combat styles add-on compatible with mods like Wildcat and Skyrim Revamped?**
  
  
> *No, I'm pretty sure Wildcat and Skyrim Revamped have combat styles that this mod would replace. Anything that uses Skypatcher to dynamically distribute combat styles will replace combat styles from other mods.*

  
  
**A note on difficulty:**
  
  
I don't think most people will have an issue with difficulty changes from this mod.
  
  
**Exclude NPCs From A Specific Mod:**
  
  
In **Aptitude\_DISTR.ini** add your mod to this line:
  

```
Keyword = Ineligible|DSP_Eligible,DAVP_Eligible,DSPLITE_Eligible|MyMod.esp
```

  
  
Replace MyMod.esp with the name of the esp you want to exclude.
  
  
**FAQ**
  
  
Spoiler
> How do I increase/decrease the difficulty?

  
  
**In Aptitude\_DISTR.ini:**
  

```
Keyword = FF5_Alternate_Perks|FF5_Prefilter,-FauxGhost|||||50
```

  
The range is 0-100. The default is 50. **The higher that number is the easier the game gets at later levels.**
  
  
This settings splits the perk distribution formula between distributing the easier alternative set of perks and the more over-the-top perks for making the game more difficult after level 40.
