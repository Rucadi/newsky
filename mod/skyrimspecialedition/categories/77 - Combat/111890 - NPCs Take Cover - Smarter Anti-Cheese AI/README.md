[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]~Your Enemies Get Smarter~[/font]

People often complain that difficulty sliders in games just make enemies more "spongy", instead of actually making them more intelligent. Well, not this mod! NPCs will now actually be smarter and capable of "somewhat" dealing with [your non-stop cheesing of the terrain](https://c.tenor.com/b2ZWIYT-jfwAAAAC/tenor.gif). As you have probably noticed a thousand times, NPCs are not the smartest and when you get somewhere they cannot reach, they tend to just stand around waiting for you to shoot them and kill them. Not fun, is it? 
  
  
This mod will result in a pretty game-changing experience that improves the NPC intelligence quite a bit. I'm basically "nullifying" (for the most part) one of the most common cheesy strategies in the entire game. Not sure if I should say "You're welcome" or "I'm so sorry". Enjoy!

*NPC in vanilla: "If I pretend to be a statue, maybe she won't shoot me?"*

  
[font=Tahoma]﻿-The Problem-
  
[/font]
  
NPCs are dumb. When fighting enemies that don't have range attacks (no bows, no magic), the player could easily cheese their way to victory just by getting to a place where the NPC couldn't reach them. The NPC would simply wait around to be shot.

[font=Tahoma]-Features of This Mod-
  
[/font]
  

  
* **NPCs seek cover:**They do this trying to lose line of sight with you, instead of waiting for you to shoot them before moving.
**Zig-Zag time:** NPCs move more than in vanilla while in cover, making them a harder target to hit. (Normal movement, no ninja dodge)
  
  
* **Dynamic AI**: the moment they notice you can potentially shoot them from your current location, they will relocate.
**NPCs call you out on your dirty tactics**. 200 voiced reactions from annoyed NPCs, using reused or spliced from vanilla lines. From "Fight me like a warrior!" to "Take cover!" or "Someone kill that damn mage!".
  
  
* **Proactive approach**: Enemies will start combat if they see you loading up your bows/magic nearby and aiming in their direction, instead of always waiting for you to shoot them in the face first.
**Super Lite**: Implementation is 99% done via native engine conditions, meaning no script lag, save bloat or delayed effects. There's a small script to trigger the new combat lines, but that's about it. 0 worries performance-wise.
  
  
* **Super Compatible**: Compatible with any and all AI-combat mods, no patches needed.

**ESL flagged?**ESL flagged.
  
  
**Safe to install mid-game?**Safe to install mid-game.
  
  
**I never use archery! Should I still download this mod?**The mod is not exclusive to archers. It affects all sorts of ranged attacks, including crossbows and magic. If you exclusively use melee and never use any magic or archery, this mod will not offer much in your case.
  
  
**Will NPCs hide the whole time now whenever I get somewhere they cannot reach?**No. They will behave as normal if they can attack you (via spells or bows). The mod only applies to cases where the NPC is defenseless against your cheesy tactics.
  
  
**Will this brick my save? Will this affect performance?**No. 99% of the job of the mod is done via native engine conditions.
  
  
**Are animals and creatures affected?**Yes, they also get the improved AI. But you can easily remove them in the SPID ini file if you want to.
  
  
**Is this compatible with...?**Yes. No patches needed.
  
  
**Isn't this behavior already in the game?**Yes, NPCs "try" to find cover in the base game. But they don't care if the cover is actually good or not. In 95% of the cases it ends up with them being wide in the open. Just watch the video.
  
  
**I've noticed NPCs taking cover more often instead of attacking me since I installed this mod. Is this intended?**You are suffering placebo. I know it's cool to blame whaver mod you last installed for all the problems in the world, but no, this mod does not cause world hunger and it also does not affect WHEN the NPCs take cover or run away from you. Like, it's literally impossible. This mod does only ONE thing when it comes to cover: NPCs will not stand in the open, waiting for you to shoot them. If the vanilla game decides you're unreachable, it will ask the NPC to find cover. That's 100% vanilla and untouched. My mod kicks in only after they've found cover. If the cover is not good enough (meaning... you can shoot them from your current position), my mod will ask the NPC to relocate to another cover until they find one where you cannot shoot them. That's it.
  
  
**What's the experience like playing with this mod?**It certainly has been pretty revolutionary in my case. I've been playing for like a week with this mod installed and it keeps surprising and challenging me at every turn. NPCs are now too damn clever. ...*Help! How do I disable this mod? I want my dumb NPCs back!*
  
**I never cheese the enemy AI. Should I still use this mod? (Lie)**Your lie persuasion attempt was unsuccessful. We all cheese the AI at one point or another. Just get the mod and thank me later.
