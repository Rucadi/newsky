**What is SkyTactics - Dynamic Combat Styles?**
  
**SkyTactics** adds currently **80+ new combat styles** to NPCs **dynamically** and **without conflicts**, thanks to **SkyPatcher**. 
  
  
The combat styles are **distributed randomly by SkyPatcher while you play**, so every combat situation can and will be different. In the vanilla game, a Level 1 Bandit will always have the same combat style. He won't block much and is not very aggressive, so he's not a real threat. With SkyTactics on the other hand, every Level 1 Bandit will be different. Combat Styles also do not persist. They can also change when you reload your save. When dying in combat and reloading a save, it will be less predictable for you, as the NPC styles will change.There are many different combat styles in this mod, each belonging to different categories or factions. As a base, all humans are covered, but if they belong to a special group, such as guards, they will not receive a general human style. Instead, they will get a specific combat style tailored to their role.
  
  

  
* **Humans**: 20 combat styles available
**Guards**: 10 combat styles available
  
* **Soldiers**: 10 combat styles available
**Forsworn**: 14 combat styles available
  
* **Bosses** (1H weapon): 4 combat styles available
**Bosses** (2H weapon): 4 combat styles available
  
* **Draugrs**: 20 combat styles available

  
  
  
  
  
**What are Combat Styles?**
  
Combat Styles decide how NPCs fight. They affect how aggressive or defensive they are, and how often they attack or block. You can also set how they react in certain situations, like when the player power attacks or blocks. Should they power attack? Should they bash? These choices can all be adjusted in Combat Styles. In the vanilla game, they are quite passive, more or less waiting for you to hit them. This is different from combat movesets, like SCAR. If you're using combat movesets for NPCs, you can be assured they will make more use of their movesets and might even surprise you.
