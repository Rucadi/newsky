I'm not good at English, so I use a translator.
  
I'm sorry if I make a mistake.
  
  
One-handed equipment without a shield in vanilla has no advantage over equipping a shield.
  
By setting a weak point on the shield, the one-handed style without the shield becomes effective.
  
  
・Equipped with a shield will slow down your movement speed.
  
　Heavy shield 30% Light shield 15%
  
・Equipping a shield reduces the attack power of one-handed weapons.
  
    Heavy shield 20% Light shield 10%
  
  
The effect is no longer applied when sheathe.(Thanks for PierreAngelique's suggestions.)
  
Effective for players and npc.
  
There is also a version that halves the effect.
