Utilizing [Object Impact Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/149484?tab=description), Telekinesis, Throwing or releasing clutter, armor or weapons in the general area of enemies will now trigger a detection event so they start looking for you.
  
  
Being lucky enough to hit them with affected objects also causes a small amount of damage depending on your level.
  
  
Includes [Grab And Throw](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/120460) support.
