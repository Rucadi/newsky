Made as a request(was a 15 min job) this Micro Behaviour mod that makes Bow's and Crossbow's weapon speed value(the one you set in Xedit) affect it's draw(fire + reload for crossbows) speed, The Quick draw perk still works, it just doubles the weapon speed instead of vanilla's 2x
  
  
  

Install it like any other behaviour mod and then tick "Weapon Speed affects Bow Draw Speed" in Nemesis

Nemesis/virtual file systems seem to have a bit of trouble with Windows Defender, make an exclusion for it in Windows Defender, If you
  
have issues with your Nemesis mods, you may need to clear your Nemesis
  
cache: Open up the mod that contains your Nemesis output and go to
  
"Data\Nemesis\_Engine\cache" delete everything inside there, **this will untick any mods you ticked, and revert the mod order back to default** then re run Nemesis

﻿Vanilla bow speeds are less than 1 and are slightly varied but nothing substantial.
  
  
**With this mod the bows will draw slower than normal by default**Thanks to:
  
Shiki for Nemesis
  
Zartar for ZBT
  
Jonahex for updating ZBT
