A personal mod that I've decided to make public, **Exalted Enemies** was inspired by Fallout 4's Legendary enemies. Any enemies (that meet the requirements set via MCM menu) now have a chance of becoming **Exalted**.
  
  
Exalted enemies have their health fully restored (so long as it doesn't exceed 10k) and gain a 100 point bonus (permanent) to Health/Magicka/Stamina.
  
  
In addition, all regeneration stats are increased by 50 points and they gain 33% magic resistance (also permanent).
  
  
Finally, all exalted enemies will drop 1 enchanted item (weapon/armor/jewelry/robe/staff) upon death.
  
  
If you're looking for a way to make your enemies more of a threat (without making them 1-hit killing machines or damage sponges) then give **Exalted Enemies** a try!
