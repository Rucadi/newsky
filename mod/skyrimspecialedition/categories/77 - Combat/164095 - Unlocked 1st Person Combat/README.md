You can do power attacks, dual wield attacks, bash, swing your weapon while casting, **AND** while moving around in **first person.**
  
  
**FOMOD installer now included: You can choose between three different behavior edits and the optional slowdown ESPFE plugin.**Behavior Options
  

  
* [size=4]Base: Removed movement restriction while dual wield attacking, power attacking, and attacking while casting
  
Base + Two handed attacks slow down less, same amount as one handed attacks
  
- Base + No movement speed slowdown during any melee attacks
