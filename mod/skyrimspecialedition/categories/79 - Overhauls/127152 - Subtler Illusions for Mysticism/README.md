[font=Arial]**Descri****ption**[/font]

[font=Arial]I like to feel stealthy when playing an illusionist so throwing glowing balls at people I want to gaslight just doesn't feel right to me. That's why I gave the spells in the Calm, Command, Fear, Frenzy, Paralyze and Silence archetypes near-instant travel time (so the projectile is functionally invisible) as well as removing their impact force (so not even the master spells send loose objects flying everywhere).
  
  
Optionally, you can make necromancy spells work the same way with Subtler Conjurations.

[font=Arial]﻿**Installation**[/font]

[font=Arial]Install as you would any other mod - with a mod manager (recommended) or directly to the data folder. Load after Mysticism. If you use Subtler Conjurations, load after Subtler Illusions.

**[font=Arial]Compatibility[/font]**

[font=Arial]Should be compatible with anything that doesn't directly edit the affected spells, scrolls, staves or magic effects; before you ask, Sorcerer does not do that.
  
  
Known Incompatibilities:
  
[/font]

  
* [font=Arial]**Immersive Sounds for Mysticism - Patch** | Edits the same magic effects that Subtler Illusions does. Loading Subtler Illusions after this removes illusion spells' immersive casting sounds but keeps them subtle; Subtler Illusions doesn't do anything if loaded before this.[/font]

**[font=Arial]Known Issues[/font]**

  
* [font=Arial]There is still a little burst of light when the projectile moving 90,000 units per frame impacts its target. Frankly, I don't know what property of the spell causes this but if you do then let me know so I can try taking that out, too. As it stands, I still think it's a step up from lobbing orbs.[/font]
[font=Arial]People still glow a bit while under the effects of illusion spells. Unlike the previous issue, this is not a technical limitation - I just prefer it this way.[/font]

**[font=Arial]Credits[/font]**

[font=Arial]Thanks to everyone on the Simonrim team for making amazing mods and having very unrestrictive permissions to do things with them. Further thanks to xEdit being a great utility and sparing me the torture of using the Creation Kit.[/font]
