**Description**
  
  
This mod changes several quests, giving them higher requirements for objectives to be fullfilled.
  
  
**Mara Quests**
  
  

  
* Swaps the Temple of Mara quests ([The Book of Love](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Book_of_Love) and [Spread the Love](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Spread_the_Love)): You first need to deliver pamphlets to the people of Riften , before you can go on the pilgrimage. (Book of love quest)
Increased the amount of pamphlets you need to deliver: 20 -> 30.
  

  
**Nirnroot Quest**
  
  

  
* [A Return to your Roots](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:A_Return_To_Your_Roots): Increases the amount of Nirnroot you have to gather for the Return to Your Roots quest to 40 (from 30). There are 43 in total in Blackreach, so it's still doable.

  
**Solstheim Quests**
  
  

  
* [A New Debt](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:A_New_Debt): Increased Drovas Relvis' debt to 100,000 septims (from 1,000) -> You'll have to pay this to Mogrul, or risk being hunted down, after Drovas becomes Neloth's steward.

Note: as Solstheim is, in most cases, higher tier content, just paying 1,000 septims felt kinda low. So, with it set to 100,000, it will have more of an impact.
  
You can change this amount by using the following console commands:
  

```
set DLC2TT1bMogrulDebt to X
```

  
X is the full price to pay Mogrul. Default value is 100000.
  
  

```
set DLC2TT1bMogrulDebthalf to X
```

  
X is half the price to pay Mogrul (by intimidating) Default value is 50000.
  
  

  
* [It's All In The Taste](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Dragonborn:It's_All_In_The_Taste): increased amount of drinks to distribute: 10 -> 13
[Fetch the Netch](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Dragonborn:Fetch_the_Netch): increased amount of Netch Jelly needed: 5 -> 10
  

  
**Thaneships**
  
  

  
* You no longer get auto-thaned by Balgruuf after killing Mirmulnir in the main quest [Dragon Rising](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dragon_Rising). You now actually need to earn the people's trust to earn your thaneship in Whiterun.
Increased the people you need to befriend in order to become a thane:
  

  

  
* Minor Hold (Falkreath, Hjaalmarch, the Pale, and Winterhold): 3 -> 12
Major Hold (Eastmarch, Haafingar, the Reach, the Rift, and Whiterun): 5 -> 20
  

  
More information about befriending people for Thaneships can be found [here](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Making_Friends_and_Influencing_People)﻿.
  
  
If you're having trouble finding enough people to please for Thaneship, I made [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61934). I'd recommend that together with mods that add more people to the cities.
  
  
If you're using [Skyrim Unbound Reborn (Alternate Start)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27962)﻿ Or you still want to get auto-thaned after killing Mirmulnir in the main quest [Dragon Rising](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Dragon_Rising), please use the **Harder Thaneships - Only Globals** file. (Do not use this together with the other harder Thaneships file.)
  
  
**Bloodkin Quests**
  
  
Removes all shortcuts to become a [Bloodkin](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Blood-Kin#Blood-Kin) to the Tribal Orcs. The only way to do this now, will be through doing the quest to find [the Forgemaster's Fingers](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Forgemaster%27s_Fingers).
  
  
**Alik'r Prisoner - Higher Fine**
  
  
Increases the cost to free the Alik'r Prisoner in the [In My Time of Need](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:In_My_Time_Of_Need) quest, from 100 to 10,000 septims.
  
  
**Stronger High Hrothgar Frost Troll**
  
  
Makes the (in)famous Frost Troll on the path to High Hrothgar stronger, with more Health and higher damage. Changed his name to "Monstrous Frost Troll".
  
  
**Weighted Quest Items**
  
  
This adds a weight to quest items that were weightless. I found it immersion breaking for them to be weightless. In addition, it incentivizes the player to complete said quests.
  
  
**Azura's Star**
  
  
This removes certain invisible walls inside [Azura's Star](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Azura%27s_Star_Interior). If you fall off, you'll die.
  
  
**Forgemaster's Fingers**
  
  
I have moved [The Forgemaster's Fingers from the Orc Bloodkin quest](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Forgemaster%27s_Fingers) to the Aetherium Forge, since there's an actual boss there called [The Forgemaster](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:The_Forgemaster).
  
  
**Malborn Container Limiter**
  
  
In the quest [Diplomatic Immunity](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Diplomatic_Immunity), you can literally give your entire inventory to Malborn for him to smuggle it inside, despite him saying that he can only take a little.
  
  
To start off with, I have capped the total amount of items you can give him to 30 carry weight.
  
  
In addition, I included an option to further restrict it, so you're unable to give him any heavy armor, shields, 2H weapons, staves or (cross)bows. Lastly I added an optional weight limit for single items, so you cannot give him an item that weighs more than that.
  
  
You can use console commands to customise the following globals:
  
  
Spoiler
  
set MCL\_GLOB\_ImmersiveOption to X
  
If X is set to 1, the limitations for certain weapons apply, in addition to the limited weight per single item.
  
(default value is 0)
  
  
set MCL\_GLOB\_SingleObjectWeightLimit to X
  
X is the limited weight per item. (default is 10.) This only applies if the previous global is set to 1. If you don't want the limited weight per single item, I'd suggest setting this value to a very high value.
  
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
  
Any mods that interfere with these quests (or the main quest, in case of Harder Thaneships) are incompatible.
  
  
**FAQ**
  
  
Q: "Why make these quests even more tedious? They're bad enough as they are."
  
A: "I understand your opinion. However, I share them for people that are interested in them, and requested them. (Yes, people actually did.) If they're not your cup of tea, that's perfectly fine. Just don't download them, and move along silently, please."
  
  
Q: "This just makes them more tedious, not harder."
  
A: I'd argue tedium is a form of difficulty. It is a test of patience. If everything is convenient and done through instant gratification (which unfortunately nowadays is the norm...), it is way too shallow and even patronising to me.
  
  
Q: ESPFE?
  
A: Yes.
  
  
Q: Does installing/updating/uninstalling on an existing save work?
  
A: As far as I know, it should. However, it's good practice to keep a backup save prior to doing this, just in case.
  
  
Q: Is this compatible with <insert mod>?
  
A: I don't know by heart. You might need to check yourself.
  
  
Q: Will you make a patch for <insert mod>?
  
A: Only if it's a mod I use myself or plan on using, I have enough time and I actually like the idea. Otherwise, feel free to do it yourself. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: I have a suggestion to improve the mod. Can you do it?
  
A: Maybe, if I have time and I like the idea, I'll consider it.
  
  
Q: Will you port this to <insert platform>?
  
A: No, I myself only support the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If someone else wants to port it, feel free. (see permission) If you decide to port it, you yourself take full responsibility to offer support to said port. I will not provide no support for any ports by third parties.
  
  
Q: I use a ported version of this mod on <insert platform> and I have a problem. Can you help?
  
A: I don't provide any support for third party ports on other platforms than the Steam and GOG English SE and AE versions of Skyrim. If you have issues, you should adress the person that ported it.
  
  
Q: Does this work on Skyrim 1.6+, aka "Anniversary Edition"?
  
A: Yes, it should.
  
  
Q: Why don't your mods use MCMs and instead use this janky console command system to set globals?
  
A: I am not a fan of MCMs. You can set the globals by making a patch in xEdit. I have no plans of changing this. If you want to add an MCM, feel free. (see permissions)
  
  
Q: Why don't you use FOMODs?
  
A: That would require reuploading the entire mod, in question, even if I only make a small change. My internet is limited and reuploading the files each time will take a huge chunk of my monthly volume.
