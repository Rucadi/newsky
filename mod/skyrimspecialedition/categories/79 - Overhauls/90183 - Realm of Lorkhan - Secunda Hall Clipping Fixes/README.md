This was made with the 4.0.1 version in mind and the collection [Immersive and Adult](https://next.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/collections/xxsqm4), but i don't see why it wouldn't work with newer versions of the OG mod (Unless the interior is changed)
  
  
If there's anything else wanted to add or suggestions, feel free to post a comment or something.
