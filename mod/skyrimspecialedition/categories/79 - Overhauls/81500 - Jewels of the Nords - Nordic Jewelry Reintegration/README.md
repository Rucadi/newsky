**Jewels of the Nords**
  
This mod seeks to integrate the nordic style jewelry into Skyrim in a way that feels natural to the game by adding various different rings, necklaces and circlets into distributed loot. The new variants are all purchasable, craftable and lootable across Skyrim and the original Stalhrim based jewelry is locked behind stalhrim crafting and only by the Skaal.
  
  
Jewels of the Nords comes with integrated support for Constructible Object Custom Keyword System, splitting the jewelry section into "Nordic" and "Other" so as not to clutter the UI with long lists. The keyword for this category has been injected into Dragonborn.esm for other mods to patchlessly add jewelry to the Nordic category should they wish to:

While crafting of circlets is enabled by default, it can be disabled with the following console command:
  
  
*Set MAKCircletCraftingEnabled to 0*
