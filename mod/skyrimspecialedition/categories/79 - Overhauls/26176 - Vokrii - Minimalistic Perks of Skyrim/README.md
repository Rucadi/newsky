[font=bebas\_neuebook]VOKRII Review on Youtube[/font]
  
  
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Full list of perks[/font]
  
  
Note that Vokrii adds additional scaling to certain skills. For instance, the effectiveness of magic schools now scales with skill level, slightly improving magnitude and duration.
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Alchemy[/font]
  
  
**Scaling:** Levels in Alchemy improve potions and poisons you make by up to **50**%.
  
**Experience:** Gain Alchemy experience by making potions and poisons.
  
  
Alchemy is more user friendly. Poison is more appealing thanks to the increased number of hits, and buff potions last much longer. The power level of individual potions remains on par with vanilla.
  
  

  
* **0 - Alchemy Mastery:** Potions and poisons you make are **1**% stronger per level of Alchemy.[/\*]
**20 - Physician:** Potions you make that restore Health, Magicka or Stamina are **25**% stronger.[/\*]

* **80 - Plague Doctor:** Nearby opponents get **25**% weakness to poison and disease.[/\*]

In total, the tree has been expanded from 9 perks (15 perk points) to 15 perks (18 perk points).
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Alteration[/font]
  
  
**Scaling:** Levels in Alteration increase the duration of Alteration spells and effects by up to **40**%, and reduce their cost by up to **40**%.
  
**Experience:** Gain Alteration experience by using Alteration spells effectively.
  
  
Alteration spells last slightly longer. There are also perks for robe wearers, battlemages (weapon and spell) and offensive telekinesis use. Other than that, the tree comprises mostly self buffs in vanilla and this remains the case in Vokrii.
  
  

  
* **0 - Alteration Mastery:** Cast Alteration spells for **0.5**% less Magicka per level of Alteration.[/\*]
**20 - Alteration Dual Casting:** Dual casting an Alteration spell overcharges its effects, increasing power and casting cost.[/\*]
  
* **20 - Mage Armor (3):** Protection spells like Stoneflesh are **100/150/200**% stronger if not wearing armor.[/\*]
**20 - Magic Resistance (3):** Increases Magic Resistance by **10/20/30**%.[/\*]
  
* **30 - Battlemage (2):** Your weapon attacks improve your spells cast on the target by **15/30**% for **3** seconds.[/\*]

* **40 - Stability:** Alteration spells and effects last **25**% longer.[/\*]
**50 - Ocato's Preparation:** When entering combat, automatically activates the most effective magical armor spell you know.[/\*]
  
* **50 - Telekinetic Force (2):** Objects thrown with Telekinesis deal an extra **250/500** points of damage.[/\*]

**90 - Telekinetic Prodigy:** Dual cast Telekinesis to grab opponents.[/\*]

In total, the tree has been expanded from 10 perks (17 perk points) to 15 perks (24 perk points).
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Archery[/font]
  
  
**Scaling:** Levels in Archery improve your damage with ranged weapons by up to **50**%.
  
**Experience:** Gain Archery experience by inflicting damage with ranged weapons.
  
  
Archery gains primarily weakening and disabling effects in order while its average damage output is on par with vanilla. Potential damage is slightly higher than vanilla thanks to more useful critical strikes (the vanilla critical strike perk adds an average of just 3.6 points of damage per shot with a daedric bow) and the option for bonus damage at very long and short ranges. To ensure balance, all ways to increase damage beyond vanilla are situational and player skill based.
  
  

  
* **0 - Archery Mastery:** Ranged weapons do **1**% more damage and **5**% more critical damage per level of Archery.[/\*]
**20 - Far Shot (2):** Ranged weapons do up to **20/40**% more damage to targets beyond **60** feet, based on distance.[/\*]
  
* **20 - Point Blank Shot (2):** Ranged weapons do up to **20/40**% more damage to targets within **20** feet, based on proximity.[/\*]
**30 - Eagle Eye:** Pressing Block while aiming will zoom in your view.[/\*]
  
* **40 - Impaling Shot** Ranged weapons wound the living for **15** seconds, causing **10** points of bleed damage per second while running.[/\*]
**40 - Breaching Shot:** Ranged weapons knock the shield out of an opponent's hands if they are blocking.[/\*]
  
* **40 - Steady Aim (2):** Pressing Block while aiming will zoom in your view and slow time by **25/50**%.[/\*]
**50 - Hunter's Discipline:** Recover twice as many arrows and bolts from dead bodies.[/\*]
  
* **50 - Power Shot:** Ranged weapons have **25**% chance to stagger most targets.[/\*]
**60 - Lion's Arrow (2):** Dual cast a projectile spell out of combat to imprint it. Fully drawn bow shots trigger a copy of the spell at **25/50**% power.[/\*]
  
* **60 - Ranger:** Can move at full speed with a drawn bow.[/\*]
**70 - Quick Shot:** Can draw a bow or reload a crossbow **30**% faster.[/\*]
  
* **80 - Arrow to the Knee:** Ranged weapons knock targets down if they are sprinting, inflicting a critical strike for **2** times critical damage.[/\*]
**80 - Gore:** Ranged weapons interrupt power attacks, knocking the attacker back and inflicting a critical strike for **2** times critical damage.[/\*]
  
* **90 - Hunter's Focus:** Can't be staggered by power attacks or bashes while drawing a bow or holding a shot.[/\*]
**100 - Pinning Shot:** Ranged weapons slow targets by **15**% per hit for **15** seconds.[/\*]
  

  
In total, the tree has been expanded from 9 perks (16 perk points) to 16 perks (21 perk points).
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Block[/font]
  
  
**Scaling:** Levels in Block improve block scaling from item quality by up to **150**%, and increase bashing damage by up to **400**%.
  
**Experience:** Gain Block experience by blocking damage, and by bashing opponents. Using a shield grants more experience than using a weapon.
  
  
Block effectiveness for shields is on par with vanilla, while weapons get a perk to increase their block effectiveness to useful levels and Shield Charge has a cooldown per target so you can't knock down opponents permanently. Compared to vanilla, the tree has similar perks but contains more disabling effects and a torch bash perk.
  
  

  
* **0 - Block Mastery:** Blocking is **0.5**% more effective per level of Block.[/\*]
**20 - Deflect Arrows:** Arrows do 25% less damage while blocking. Arrows that hit a shield do no damage.[/\*]
  
* **20 - Power Bash:** Able to do a power bash by holding down Attack while blocking.[/\*]
**30 - Unwavering Defense:** Blocking an attack damages the attacker's Stamina by **15** points.[/\*]
  
* **30 - Weapon Block:** Blocking with weapons is **25**% more effective.[/\*]
**40 - Quick Reflexes:** Time slows down if you are blocking during an enemy's power attack.[/\*]
  
* **40 - Torch Bash:** Bashing with a torch deals ten times as much fire damage and causes living opponents to flee in panic.[/\*]
**50 - Deadly Bash (2):** Bashing deals five/fifteen times as much damage.[/\*]
  
* **50 - Elemental Protection:** Blocking with a shield reduces elemental damage taken by **50**%.[/\*]
**60 - Poke the Dragon:** Blocking an attack has **15**% chance to stagger the attacker, exposing them to a critical strike counterattack within **3** seconds for **2** times critical damage.[/\*]
  
* **70 - Block Runner:** Can move at full speed while blocking.[/\*]
**80 - Mocking Blow:** Power bashing reduces attack damage by **20**%, fading over **10** seconds.[/\*]
  
* **90 - Dragon Tail:** Bashing to interrupt a power attack has **30**% chance to knock the attacker down, potentially disarming them.[/\*]
**90 - Shield Charge:** Able to sprint with a shield raised, knocking opponents down for **15** points of Stamina per second.[/\*]
  
* **100 - Stoneheart:** Can't be staggered by power attacks and bashes while blocking.[/\*]

  
In total, the tree has been expanded from 9 perks (13 perk points) to 15 perks (16 perk points).
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Conjuration[/font]
  
  
**Scaling:** Levels in Conjuration increase the duration of Conjuration spells and effects by up to **40**%, reduce their cost by up to **40**% and increase the damage of bound weapons by up to **100**%.
  
**Experience:** Gain Conjuration experience by using Conjuration spells effectively.
  
  
Conjuration focusses primarily on making underpowered playstyles more viable, such as reanimation, atronachs (as opposed to Dremora Lords) and bound weapons. Bound weapons now gain damage scaling from skill levels, and a lot of utility including an atronach synergy and a deadly non-elemental burn that scales with Conjuration duration.
  
  

  
* **0 - Conjuration Mastery:** Cast Conjuration spells for **0.5**% less Magicka per level of Conjuration.[/\*]
**20 - Conjuration Dual Casting:** Dual casting a Conjuration spell overcharges its effects, increasing duration and casting cost.[/\*]
  
* **20 - Mystic Binding:** Bound Weapon spells now create Mystic Weapons instead, which deal more damage.[/\*]
**30 - Atromancy:** Summoned daedra and creatures last twice as long.[/\*]
  
* **30 - Necromancy:** Summoned and raised undead last twice as long.[/\*]
**30 - Soul Stealer:** Bound weapons cast Soul Trap on targets for **5** seconds.[/\*]
  
* **40 - Oblivion Binding:** Bound weapons banish conjured daedra, deal **100** bonus damage to other daedra and turn raised undead.[/\*]
**40 - Rift Summoner (2):** Can summon three times as far away/at any distance.[/\*]
  
* **50 - Ghoul Frenzy:** Raised undead are created with **100**% extra attack speed and **50**% extra movement speed, fading over **60** seconds.[/\*]
**50 - Oblivion Stone (2):** Summoned daedra and creatures get **100/200** points of armor and **25/50**% magic resistance.[/\*]
  
* **60 - Hollow Binding:**Bound weapons cut through flesh and spirit, reducing magic resistance by **25**% for **5** seconds.[/\*]
**60 - Grand Conjurer (2):** Can reanimate, banish or command targets up to **15** levels higher/of any level.[/\*]
  
* **70 - Blood Zombie:**Summoned and raised undead absorb **5** points of Health per second from opponents in melee range.[/\*]
**70 - Elemental Potency:** Atronach summoning spells now call higher level Potent Atronachs with improved elemental attacks.[/\*]
  
* **80 - Void Brand:** Bound weapons drain **30** points of Magicka and Stamina per second for **5** seconds. When both are depleted, drains Health instead.[/\*]
**90 - Elemental Conflux:** While near an allied atronach, gain a **20**% bonus to matching elemental spells and effects, and **50** matching elemental damage to bound weapons.[/\*]
  
* **90 - Necromaster:** Undead raised with Dread Zombie or Dead Thrall get bonus Health, Magicka and Stamina based on their level, and you can give them items.[/\*]
**100 - Twin Souls:** You can summon or reanimate an additional minion.[/\*]
  

  
In total, the tree has been expanded from 15 perks (16 perk points) to 18 perks (21 perk points).
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Destruction[/font]
  
  
**Scaling:** Levels in Destruction increase the power of Destruction spells and effects by up to **40**%, and reduce their cost by up to **40**%.
  
**Experience:** Gain Destruction experience by using Destruction spells effectively.
  
  
Destruction now gains significant damage scaling with level, balanced out by a slight nerf to the elemental damage perks. The net total is about 30% more damage (13% for multi element spells), making up for the general weakness of vanilla Destruction magic without making them overpowered. A perk exists to reduce elemental resistances, making especially frost mages more capable. Underused spell types such as master spells and wall spells get their own buffs.
  
  

  
* **0 - Destruction Mastery:** Cast Destruction spells for **0.5**% less Magicka per level of Destruction.[/\*]
**20 - Destruction Dual Casting:** Dual casting a Destruction spell overcharges its effects, increasing power and casting cost.[/\*]
  
* **30 - Augmented Flames (2):** Fire spells and effects are **20/40**% more powerful.[/\*]
**30 - Augmented Frost (2):** Frost spells and effects are **20/40**% more powerful.[/\*]
  
* **30 - Augmented Shock (2):** Shock spells and effects are **20/40**% more powerful.[/\*]
**30 - Raw Power (3):** Non-elemental Destruction spells and effects are **10/20/30**% more powerful.[/\*]
  
* **40 - Rune Master (2):** Can place runes three times as far away/at any distance, and runes are **10/20**% more powerful.[/\*]
**50 - Devouring Flames:** Fire spells ignite targets below **20**% Health, dealing extra damage for **5** seconds.[/\*]
  
* **50 - Chilling Frost:** Frost spells reduce attack speed by **20**% and inflict **15**% weakness to frost for **10** seconds.[/\*]
**50 - Deafening Shock:** Shock spells have **20**% chance to silence targets for **2** seconds.[/\*]
  
* **60 - Hethoth's Disjunction:** All opponents affected by a Destruction cloak get **25**% weakness to that element.[/\*]
**60 - Impact:** Projectile based Destruction spells have **30**% chance to stagger their targets when dual cast.[/\*]
  
* **70 - Scorched Earth:** Fire spells burn their victims to cinders, leaving a pyre that ignites opponents, dealing extra damage for **10** seconds.[/\*]
**70 - Winter's Grasp:** Frost spells freeze targets below **20**% Health in a block of ice for **5** seconds.[/\*]
  
* **70 - Crackling Sphere:** Shock spells have **20**% chance to levitate targets for **2** seconds.[/\*]
**80 - Elemental Barrier:** Destruction walls and cloaks deal **25**% more damage, and the damage persists for **5** seconds.[/\*]
  
* **90 - Elemental Shield:** Destruction cloaks grant **50**% resistance to their element.[/\*]
**100 - Hellstorm:** Deal **50**% more elemental damage to targets that are ignited, frozen, silenced or levitated by other Destruction perks.[/\*]
  

  
In total, the tree has been expanded from 14 perks (17 perk points) to 18 perks (24 perk points).
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Enchanting[/font]
  
  
**Scaling:** Levels in Enchanting allows you to enchant items up to **100**% better.
  
**Experience:** Gain Enchanting experience by enchanting items, or by wielding a staff in combat.
  
  
Enchanting is more balanced. Subpar enchantments (those without a 25% perk in vanilla) and items (clothing) are more effective. Popular enchantments on popular items are on par with vanilla. Chaos Damage is weaker. Enchantment bonuses are available at a lower level so Enchanting is not useless in the early game. Staves are more powerful and level Enchanting. Scrolls are more accessible.
  
  

  
* **0 - Enchanting Mastery:** New enchantments are **1**% stronger per level of Enchanting.[/\*]
**20 - Power Stone (3):** Staves are **20/35/50**% stronger, and an equipped staff improves other weapon enchantments by **20/35/50**%.[/\*]
  
* **20 - Soul Squeezer:** Soul gems replenish **250** extra charge when used to recharge weapons.[/\*]
**30 - Weapon Enchanter:** New enchantments placed on weapons are **25**% stronger.[/\*]
  
* **30 - Armor Enchanter:** New enchantments placed on armor pieces or clothing are **25**% stronger.[/\*]
**40 - Scroll Sage (3):** Scrolls are **100/150/200**% stronger.[/\*]
  
* **40 - Soul Siphon:** Death blows with enchanted weapons to creatures trap **5**% of the victim's soul, recharging the weapon. Does not apply to staves.[/\*]
**50 - Mana Stone:** Staves cost **50**% less charge, and an equipped staff reduces the charge cost of other weapon enchantments by **50**%.[/\*]
  
* **50 - Scroll Hunter:** **10**% chance to find a random scroll on the corpses of people you kill.[/\*]
**60 - Soul Enchanter:** New enchantments placed on weapons have **1000** extra charge.[/\*]
  
* **60 - Thunderstruck:** Weapon enchantments are **50**% stronger when delivered by a power attack.[/\*]
**70 - Mana Shield:** Take **25**% less damage from attacks if you have a staff equipped and no shield.[/\*]
  
* **70 - Regalia Enchanter:**New enchantments placed on necklaces, robes, hoods and circlets are **15**% stronger.[/\*]
**80 - Staff Recharge:** After using a staff, the spent charge regenerates at a rate of **5** points per second.[/\*]
  
* **90 - Spider Hunter:** **5**% chance to find a random imbued spider on the corpses of people you kill.[/\*]
**100 - Extra Effect:** Can place two enchantments upon the same item.[/\*]
  

  
In total, the tree has been expanded from 9 perks (13 perk points) to 16 perks (20 perk points).
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Heavy Armor[/font]
  
  
**Scaling:** Levels in Heavy Armor increase the armor rating of Heavy Armor pieces by up to **40**%.
  
**Experience:** Gain Heavy Armor experience by taking damage while wearing Heavy Armor pieces, or by being in combat while wearing at least 2 Heavy Armor pieces whether or not you get hit.
  
  
Heavy armor rating is slightly lower due to a nerf to Matching Heavy Set, but there are several other damage mitigating perks that reduce incoming weapon perks, incoming stagger, or incapacitate opponents that hit you.
  
  

  
* **0 - Heavy Armor Mastery:** Armor rating of Heavy Armor pieces increased by **1**% per level of Heavy Armor.[/\*]
**20 - Cushioned (2):** You take half/no damage from falling if wearing all Heavy Armor.[/\*]
  
* **30 - Battle Fatigue:** Take up to **20**% less attack damage from opponents with low Stamina if wearing all Heavy Armor.[/\*]
**30 - Heavy Armor Fit:** Armor rating of Heavy Armor pieces increased by **15**% if wearing all Heavy Armor.[/\*]
  
* **40 - Face of Death:** Other Heavy Armor perks no longer require a helmet. Armor rating of Heavy Armor pieces increased by **20**% if not wearing a helmet.[/\*]
**40 - Immovable Object:** Taking an incoming hit in all Heavy Armor has **10**% chance to stagger the attacker.[/\*]
  
* **50 - Heavy Armor Training:** Heavy Armor weighs nothing and doesn't slow you down when worn.[/\*]
**60 - Reap the Whirlwind:** Taking an incoming hit in all Heavy Armor grants **20**% extra attack damage and critical damage against the attacker for **5** seconds.[/\*]

**70 - Matching Heavy Set:** Armor rating of Heavy Armor pieces increased by **15**% if wearing a matched set of **3** or more Heavy Armor pieces.[/\*]
  
* **80 - Elemental Defense:** Take **15**% less elemental damage if wearing all Heavy Armor.[/\*]

In total, the tree has been expanded from 8 perks (12 perk points) to 13 perks (14 perk points).
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Illusion[/font]
  
  
**Scaling:** Levels in Illusion increase the duration of Illusion spells and effects by up to **40**%. and reduce their cost by up to **40**%.
  
**Experience:** Gain Illusion experience by using Illusion spells effectively.
  
  
Illusion in vanilla Skyrim consists mainly of level cap buffs. These are merged into Animage, creating space for other special effects that are necessary to make an Illusion specialist viable, such as the ability to actually kill the last remaining opponent after Fury without resorting to direct damage. Master of the Mind is available significantly sooner to ensure Illusion mages are not shut out of Dwemer dungeons for most of their lifespan.
  
  

  
* **0 - Illusion Mastery:** Cast Illusion spells for **0.5**% less Magicka per level of Illusion.[/\*]
**20 - Illusion Dual Casting:** Dual casting an Illusion spell overcharges its effects, increasing power and casting cost.[/\*]
  
* **20 - Animage (3):** Mind affecting spells and effects work on creatures and people up to **10/20/40** levels higher, and other targets up to **5/10/20** levels higher.[/\*]
**30 - Neverworld:** Calm spells have **50**% chance to persist for **15** seconds when broken.[/\*]
  
* **40 - Terror:** Fear spells cause opponents to drop their weapon.[/\*]
**50 - Iron Maiden:** Fury spells inflict **20** damage whenever the target attacks.[/\*]
  
* **50 - Quiet Casting:** All spells and shouts from any school of magic are silent to others.[/\*]
**60 - Lamb to the Slaughter:** Calm spells reduce armor by **100** points and magic resistance by **25**%.[/\*]
  
* **60 - Splendor:** Rally spells improve the target's attributes by an additional **50** points.[/\*]
**70 - Master of the Mind (2):** Mind affecting spells work on undead, daedra and automatons at half/full duration.[/\*]
  
* **70 - Paralyzing Fear:** Fear spells have **25**% chance to compel their targets to remain motionless.[/\*]
**80 - Enrage:** Fury spells cause targets to deal **50**% more attack damage, except when they are attacking the caster.[/\*]
  
* **90 - Spirit of War:** Rally spells manifest spectral images of allied targets in combat. The illusions have **40**% Health and fight for you until the spell wears off.[/\*]
**90 - Blur:** Move **15**% faster while invisible.[/\*]
  
* **100 - Mind Thrall:** Can activate a person under a mind affecting spell or effect to take control, forcing them to follow you and fight for you until released.[/\*]

  
In total, the tree has been expanded from 13 perks (13 perk points) to 15 perks (18 perk points).
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Light Armor[/font]
  
  
**Scaling:** Levels in Light Armor increase the armor rating of Light Armor pieces by up to **40**%.
  
**Experience:** Gain Light Armor experience by taking damage while wearing Light Armor pieces, by being in combat while wearing at least 2 Light Armor pieces whether or not you get hit, or by hitting opponents with fists.
  
  
Light armor rating is slightly lower due to a nerf to Matching Light Set, but mobility as well as damage are increased in Light Armor, differentiating Light Armor much more from Heavy Armor. It is now clearly a suboptimal choice for face tank builds, but a superior choice for agile fighters and ranged attackers. Monk characters will also find several powerful unarmed combat perks in this tree, such as damage scaling, cost reduction and crowd control. These perks do not require Light Armor to be worn and unarmed attacks grant Light Armor experience regardless of what armor is worn.
  
  

  
* **0 - Light Armor Mastery:** Armor rating of Light Armor pieces increased by **1**% per level of Light Armor.[/\*]
**20 - Agility:** Regenerate an additional **2**% of your maximum Stamina per second if wearing all Light Armor.[/\*]
  
* **20 - Iron Fist (3):** Deal extra unarmed damage equal to **5/15/30**% of current Stamina if both hands are empty, gaining Light Armor experience.[/\*]
**30 - Light Armor Fit:** Armor rating of Light Armor pieces increased by **15**% if wearing all Light Armor.[/\*]
  
* **40 - Keen Senses:** Other Light Armor perks no longer require a helmet. Armor rating of Light Armor pieces increased by **20**% if not wearing a helmet.[/\*]
**40 - Windrunner:** Move **10**% faster if wearing all Light Armor.[/\*]
  
* **50 - Light Armor Training:** Light Armor weighs nothing and doesn't slow you down when worn.[/\*]
**60 - Flurry of Blows (2):** Power attacks with two empty hands cost **25/50**% less Stamina and have a **50**% chance to stagger opponents, potentially disarming them.[/\*]
  
* **60 - Wardancer:** Your attacks deal **20**% more damage and critical damage in all Light Armor. Taking an unblocked hit disables this effect for **10** seconds.[/\*]
**70 - Matching Light Set:** Armor rating of Light Armor pieces increased by **15**% if wearing a matched set of **3** or more Light Armor pieces.[/\*]
  
* **80 - Evasive Sprint:** While sprinting in all Light Armor, take **50**% less attack damage and weight does not affect Stamina drain.[/\*]
**80 - Tough Hide:** Wearing all Light Armor grants **40**% Poison Resist and Disease Resist.[/\*]
  
* **90 - Ki Strike:** Power attacks with two empty hands deal **60** points of random elemental damage.[/\*]
**100 - Untouchable:** Move an additional **15**% faster in combat in all Light Armor. Taking an unblocked hit disables this effect for **10** seconds.[/\*]
  

  
In total, the tree has been expanded from 6 perks (10 perk points) to 14 perks (17 perk points).
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Lockpicking[/font]
  
  
**Scaling:** Levels in Lockpicking increase the size of the opening position by up to **100**%.
  
**Experience:** Gain Lockpicking experience by opening locks, by breaking lockpicks (or failing with the Skeleton Key), or by shutting down automatons.
  
  
Lockpicking still features the familiar vanilla perks, other than the Unbreakable perk which makes all other perks redundant. In addition, there is a new focus on looting, with perks such as Archaeologist that grants a very large boost to dungeon loot to reward investment into this tree. Lockpicking perks can also disable automatons and even control an automaton as a permanent minion.
  
  

  
* **0 - Lockpicking Mastery:** Locks are **1**% easier to pick per level of Lockpicking.[/\*]
**20 - Looter:** In most dungeons, chests contain up to **100** more gold and many other containers contain up to **10** more gold.[/\*]

**Experience:** Gain One-Handed experience by inflicting damage with one-handed weapons.
  
  
One-handed damage output is on par with vanilla, but the power attack perk now scales with Stamina, encouraging Stamina investment and enabling a new high damage, high Stamina, low Health build. The weapon specific perks are much more effective than in vanilla (where two out of three only ever added a few measly points of damage per hit). Several new defensive perks and a dagger branch are added.

Pickpocket perks are merged to reduce waste and filler perks. The Pickpocket tree also gains a focus on general crime, with perks such as Lawless Times to get out of nonviolent crime bounties (the bane of a thief) and the ability to steal people's gold without any risk of detection. Reverse pickpocketing is more viable thanks to a cursed coin you can slip in an opponent's pocket to bring doom upon them.

[font=bebas\_neuebook]Smithing[/font]
  
  
**Scaling:** Levels in Smithing allows you to improve items up to **100**% more.
  
**Experience:** Gain Smithing experience by creating expensive items, or by mining ore veins.
  
  
Smithing now includes padding perks that allow characters to wear robes like the Vigilants of Stendarr, clothing or go full berserker while still benefiting from full armor perks as long as their other slots are armored. Most crafting perks are left unchanged for compatibility with crafting overhauls.
  
  

  
* **0 - Steel Smithing:** Can create Steel armor and weapons at forges, and improve them twice as much.[/\*]

**Scaling:** Levels in Sneak make you less likely to be detected, especially at a distance.
  
**Experience:** Gain Sneak experience by sneaking around characters without being detected.
  
  
Sneak effectiveness is on par with vanilla, except the Blind Spot perk is added to help melee sneak characters. Silent rolls are more useful, and there is a combo where you can attack out of sneak rolls with a dagger for a guaranted critical strike.
  
  

  
* **0 - Sneak Mastery:** You are **0.5**% harder to detect when sneaking per level of Sneak.[/\*]

**Experience:** Gain Speech experience by trading items, or by shouting (based on the cooldown of the shout).
  
  
Speech is no longer just about social perks with limited usefulness. The new capstone perk Private Stock allows you to just buy a variety of items from otherwise mundane vendors as a reward for investing into them. Gain Speech experience when shouting, which unlocks several shout related perks. The tree also offers a permanent animal companion.

**Scaling:** Levels in Two=Handed improve your damage with two-handed weapons by up to **40**%.
  
**Experience:** Gain Two-Handed experience by inflicting damage with two-handed weapons.
  
  
Two-handed damage output is on par with vanilla, but the power attack damage perk now scales with Stamina to differentiate high Stamina and high Health builds. The weapon specific perks are much more effective than the vanilla ones (where neither the bleed perk nor the critical strike perk has any meaningful impact) and offer strong but situational incapacitating effects. Unlike the One-Handed tree, most other new perks are offensive in nature, cementing Two-Handed weapons as the "damage" option.
  
  

  
* **0 - Two-Handed Mastery:** Two-handed weapons do **1**% more damage and **5**% more critical damage per level of Two-Handed.[/\*]

[font=bebas\_neuebook]Recommended mods[/font]

[font=bebas\_neuebook]Do NPCs use these perks?[/font]
  
  
For reasons of compatibility with enemy overhauls, NPCs only get the corresponding Vokrii perks to their vanilla perks, and do not get the new Vokrii perks. There is a separate mod: [Vokrii Perks for NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47055).
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Installation[/font]
  
  
**Installation procedure:** If your character is level 2 or higher, installing the mod will start a perk refund process. This can take up to several minutes and a message is displayed when the process is complete. If you are switching from another perk mod, follow the instructions in its mod description to refund your perk points before uninstalling.
  
  
**Uninstallation procedure:** Refund your perk points (see below) before uninstalling.
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]FAQ[/font]
  
  

  
* **How do I refund my perk points (respec):** Make the skill legendary or use the perk refund feature in Apocrypha. *Cheat:* Bring exactly 1337 gold (no more, no less) to a cooking pot and craft a Scroll of Legends, which can be consumed to instantly refund all perk points.[/\*]
**I meet all of the requirements for a perk but still can't put a point into it:** You have another mod loaded below Vokrii that modifies those perks. Load it above Vokrii.[/\*]
  
* **Some perks or skill trees are still vanilla:** You have another mod loaded below Vokrii that modifies those perks or skill trees. Load it above Vokrii.[/\*]
**Are critical strikes overpowered:** Critical damage in Skyrim does not work the way it does in other games. It is not a multiplier to your total damage, but a value that is roughly equal to half of your weapon's unmodified base damage. For instance, a daedric greatsword deals 12 extra damage on a critical strike regardless of skill, smithing or enchantments. The large critical damage bonuses in Vokrii ensure that critical hits are actually useful.[/\*]
  
* **Why do the mastery perks give a scaling bonus instead of a flat bonus like Ordinator and Adamant:** One goal of Vokrii is to stay close to vanilla balancing. Reducing the number of perks while maintaining their overall bonus leads to "stair step" syndrome for weapon perks, where your power level swings massively from one level to the next. A scaling bonus prevents this.[/\*]
**Why do my novice and apprentice level spells cost less than in vanilla:** There is a hidden cost reduction for these spells. The reason is that vanilla spell mastery perks give a 50% casting cost reduction to basically all spells you are using at that point, so any perk that does not allow you to cast early game spells for 50% less in the early game would be a major nerf. Because the mastery perks in Vokrii scale with skill level, base casting costs on novice and apprentice spells were reduced so that the math checks out and the spells have casting costs comparable to vanilla at the point in time where you are using them. Note that this is not a "hack" or unique to Vokrii: perk overhaul Adamant encountered the same issue and has a similar hidden cost reduction perk to solve it.[/\*]
  
* **Does this mod change the cost or effectiveness of dual casting:** No, but I have several combat overhauls such as [Wildcat](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1368), [Smilodon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2824) and [Valravn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53869) that include this feature.[/\*]
**Most of the one-handed/two-handed perks don't do anything:** You have another mod that adds a hidden Combat Hit Spell perk with maximum priority, which will override all of Vokrii's Combat Hit Spell perks, disabling them regardless of load order. This is a design flaw on the part of the other mod. This will affect all perk overhauls, not just Vokrii. Unfortunately, this includes the Bloodlust sword from the Dawnfang/Duskfang Creation Club DLC.[/\*]
  
* **I'm having huge script lag:** This mod is very lightweight and does not cause significant script lag. It features no persistent scripts and very few scripted effects in general. However, certain combat overhauls are inefficently designed and will run a heavy script whenever any actor is struck by anything, including harmless or friendly effects, potentially leading to script overload. This is a design flaw on the part of the combat overhaul and you should replace it. If you can't or don't want to do this, avoid perks that affect other actors, such as Inspire and Elemental Conflux.[/\*]
**The perks Ranger, Quick Shot and Block Runner have no effect:** These are vanilla Skyrim perks with a peculiar bug where the effect stays after the perk is removed from your character, so taking it again makes no difference. Additionally, Ranger has another bug where it has no effect if you take the perk while sneaking. Note that these are vanilla perks and exhibit the same flaws in the vanilla game. See [the UESP page](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Archery) for more information[/\*]
  
* **Fistfights (brawls) immediately end or turn into a real fight:** The "**Brawl Bug**" is a common issue with many gameplay mods and hard to avoid due to the way Skyrim brawls are implemented. Vokrii comes with a copy of the Modern Brawl Bug Fix included to solve this issue. If it does not, you may have the outdated Brawl Bugs Patch loaded after Vokrii (as a standalone mod or included with another mod such as Enhanced Blood Textures). Remove it or add the [Modern Brawl Bug Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1473) to the end of your load order.[/\*]
