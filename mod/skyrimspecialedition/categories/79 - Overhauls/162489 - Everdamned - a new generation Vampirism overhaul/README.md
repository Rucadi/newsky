DISCLAIMER - This mod is inspired by the general vibe of **Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines** and draws on features from MissLeeches' **Vampiric Thirst** and Enai's **Sacrosanct**.
  
Both of these mods are all time favorites of mine. The first and only mod I'd created before Everdamned was a compatibility patch so I can play them together. With time, I began tweaking things here and there, keeping the plugin in a dedicated folder called **Sacrosanct tweaks**. At some point it became clear that my ambitions outgrew a mere compatibility patch, and this project commenced.
  
  
All features that got carried over from **Vampiric Thirst** and **Sacrosanct** are expanded, reworked and lie at the foundation of mod's design (as opposed to mindlessly attached). From Vampiric Thirst, Everdamned inherits **Disciplines** and **Seduction** mechanic. From Sacrosanct, Everdamned build on **Hemomancy** and borrows **Blue Blood**, as well as several mortal and Vampire Lord spells and abilities. Most things that were ported over were left with their original names for clarity and transparency, but usually have different visuals and/or different effects.

* Blood as resource - **Vitae**, with own resource bar
Soft, but powerful incentives to act like a Vampire, enabled by the presence of Vitae.
  
* Multiple systems of organic progression - **Vampiric Rank** (Age), **Vampirism** skill tree, and more.
**Combat Draining** with brand new animations to complement the gameplay
  
* **Charm** - feeding through seduction for role playing opportunities that also mesh well with gameplay goals
Heavily reworked **Vampire Lord** perk tree
  
* Ways to unleash and gain control over the **inner Beast**
Core mechanics implemented without Papyrus, so no drops in performance or added save bloat
  
* **Hotkeys** to reduce keybind bloat in a natural manner
configurable through **MCM** (to some extent)
  

*...and more.

[/i]A ton of cool spells and powers, stretched over a lengthy (adjustable in MCM) period of progression. Pressures of being a vampire are increased, but come with tools to deal with them. Hunting for blood is more engaging and plays a much bigger role than in vanilla, but baseline minimal effort is pretty much same. Some mechanics mesh with underused vanilla systems (like "relationship rank") and different skills, giving overall gameplay more depth.

As the name suggests, Everdamned imagines vampiric condition as an eternal curse. You are now faster, stronger and tougher than ever before, can bend mortals to your will, ageing only grows your powers and you also get to live forever. How is this a curse, you ask?
  
  
The Daedric nature of the curse dampens connection to the Divines, rendering you void of their grace. Your skin is susceptible to sunlight, and you cannot be healed by **Restoration** effects.
  
The Beast takes root inside you. Its urges make you into a creature driven by bloodlust that can never be sated, only curtailed briefly. Controlling it will inform your decisions for the rest of your - very long - existence.
  
Moreover, the benefits come gradually, while the negatives are front loaded. A newborn vampire has little edge over its former kin, and needs to grapple with new existential challenges straight away.
  
  
Everdamned tries to flesh out these challenges and make them engaging, rather than tedious and constricting. For that, it relies on a new resource, called **Vitae**  - essentially, a blood reserve for fueling vampiric powers. It is leveraged to transform the matter of your vampiric nutrition from a chore to a proper hunt for blood with long-term benefits and role play opportunities. Be a ravenous beast, a dapper charmer/temptress, an unseen shadow or all of that combined to quench your thirst and keep a healthy diet.
  
As you grow more powerful, sunlight becomes less oppressive, but always remains an obstacle to consider. In absence of Restoration healing, you need to rely on the stolen blood through **Vigor Mortis**, lifesteal effects and Alchemy to regenerate Health, or work your way up to making it effective again.
  
  
﻿﻿﻿**[b][color=#8e7cc3][size=4][b][color=#8e7cc3][size=4]♰**[/size][/color][/b] Basics **[b][color=#8e7cc3][size=4]♰**[/size][/color][/b][/size][/color][/b]
  
There is a number of baseline characteristics and powers that all vampires share:
  
   ﻿
  

  
* **Poison and Disease resistance**: Vampiric blood gives you **100% Resistance** to poisons and disease.
**Moonlit Waters**: A vampire can swim underwater without drowning. At night, when moons are shining bright, vampire can sheathe its weapons and thread the water surface.
  
* **Resist Frost**: Your undead body possesses a **20% Frost** resistance, when you are **Sated**. As it grows more desiccated and lifeless, this effect increases up to **50%** when **Bloodstarved.**
**Weakness to Fire**: At the same time, it begins to catch fire more easily. You are **20%** weaker to **Fire** when **Sated**. This effect increases up to **50%** when **Bloodstarved.**
  
* **Weakness to Sunlight**: In sunny weather, Health, Magicka and Stamina are lowered by 25**[b] (Sated) - 100 (Bloodstarved)** [/b]points. In direct sunlight, their regeneration is halted, and **[b]Vitae**[/b]  dwindles by **[b]2-10** points per second. [/b]When it dries up, sunlight becomes **[b]scorching**[/b].\*
**[b]Forsaken**: [/b]Void of divine grace**, [b]Restoration** healing effects [/b]have no effect on you. Skilled practitioners of a certain perfectly valid school of magic can learn to negate this effect.
  
* **No regeneration**: Vampire's **Health** does not regenerate naturally. Any effects boosting **Health** **regeneration** have no effect, unless **Vigor Mortis** is active. \*\*

  

  
* **Vampiric Drain**: absorb **6 (Sated) - 16 (Bloodstarved) Health** and **10 - 20 Vitae** from target. Effectiveness grows up to **100%** with **Vampirism** skill level.
**Vampire's Seduction**: Once a day, silently bewitches a person, calming them and allowing you to feed. Works on targets whose level does
  
 not exceed your **Vampirism** skill. Target must be facing and detecting you.* **Vampire's Sight**: Improved night vision, that adapts to light level of the environment. \*\*\*

  
**Vampiric Drain** is envisioned as a core part of toolkit. It has interactions with other spells and restores **Vitae**  alongside **Health**, making it even harder to balance properly. For this reason, it cannot be cast from both hands at the same time outside of dual casting. This can be toggled off in the MCM.
  
  
*\* Direct sunlight represents actual in-game light level. Depending on your ENB/CS, [i]lightning mods etc.*, shadows you see ingame may not correspond to what the game engine thinks is shadowed. If that is the case for you and you feel it breaks your immersion, visit Everdamned MCM menu to make sun weakness not depend on light level. But I think its still fun regardless, so its on by default. Also, you can disable scorching sunlight entirely.[/i]
  
  
*\*\* Restoration Healing penalty is disabled when player gets a certain perk(see spoiler). Also, it can be disabled in MCM for compatibility reasons, like your perk overhaul omits this vanilla perk records/gives them a different name so you can't find them.*
  
Spoiler
  
Necromage
  
  
*\*\*\* Again, due to inconsistencies with light level based effects, you can disable night vision adaptivity in the MCM and pick a fixed preferred level there.*
  
  
﻿﻿﻿**[b][color=#8e7cc3][size=4][b][color=#8e7cc3][size=4]♰**[/size][/color][/b] [/size][/color]Vampire and the Sun**[color=#8e7cc3][size=4][b][color=#8e7cc3][size=4] ♰**[/size][/color][/b][/size][/color][/b]
  
In sunny weather, Health, Magicka and Stamina are lowered by **25 (Sated) - 100 (Blood-starved)** points. In **direct sunlight**, their regeneration is halted, and **[b]Vitae**[/b] dwindles by **2-10** points per second. When it dries up, sunlight becomes **scorching**, which is a nice way of saying that you catch fire like a matchstick. 
  
  
As long as Auri-El peers upon Mundus through that dastardly hole in the sky, vampires will have to endure its unyielding presence. Much to Harkon's eternal disappointment, there is no way to become a true daywalker, immune to its effects. Every day, from 6 AM up until 7 PM direct sunshine is intense enough to harm a vampire.
  
However, it may become obstructed by present weather conditions. Who needs to blot out the sun with an ancient prophecy, when Skyrim natural climate can make you forget what daylight is supposed to look like?
  
All in all, a well-fed vampire that has some **[b]Vitae**[/b]to spare can brave the sun with little actual consequence and run errands or even travel normally during the day. However, the pressure to seek shelter will still always be present.
  
  
**KEEP IN MIND** - if you initiate fast travel while in direct sunlight and arrive at your destination while in the **direct sunlight**, game will treat it as if you where fast traveling under direct sunlight for the whole duration of the travel - in practice, that means you will arrive with **0 Vitae**.
  
This is not a problem per se, as it makes perfect sense as in "travel a long distance under sunlight and get burned", but, unfortunately, I am unable to provide an MCM option to make regular fast travel completely safe at all times. Thankfully, i found a way to exclude carriage/ferry (and other forms of sitting fast) travel from this behavior (let's say that paid travel services come with a parasol).
  
  
**[b][color=#8e7cc3][size=4][b][color=#8e7cc3][size=4]♰**[/size][/color][/b] Vampiric Rank (Age) **[b][color=#8e7cc3][size=4]♰**[/size][/color][/b][/size][/color][/b]
  
  
A dexterous hunter of the night, vampire moves **5% (Fledgling) - 25% (Nightmaster)** faster, and effective Sneak skill is **10 - 40** points higher. Some powers and abilities improve with age, usually their description will reflect that.  
  
  

  
* **Fledgling:** the beginning of an eternal journey.
**Blooded** (5 days total): Vampire can sense presence of the living nearby with **Blood Sense**. When feeding on fresh blood, it may be able to hear **Psychic Echoes** of victim's mind.
  
* **Mistwalker** (20 days total): Vampire gains **Darkwing Dash**, a bizarre but notorious power to dissipate into a cloud of bats.
**Nightstalker** (50 days total): Growing resilience helps stave off effects of the sun for longer, granting a **Twilight Lurker** ability.
  
* **Nightlord** (100 days total): With age, vampire achieves greater control over its urges. **Hunger** progression is now slowed.
**Nightmaster** (175 days total): This is the last **Rank** a vampire can realistically ascend to within mortal (gamesave) lifespan. Most of the vampiric powers and abilities are tremendously enhanced.
  

  

  
* **Blood Sense**: Sense the presence of living within **120** feet. Within **30** feet, you can discern the quality of nourishment offered by person's blood. Costs 5 **Vitae**  to maintain, unless **Blood-starved**.
**Psychic Echoes**: Fresh blood brims with echoes of life's journey. If there is a skill in which the victim is significantly more proficient, your own skill may improve based on the difference. Only works once per person.
  
* **Darkwing Dash**: Dissipate into a cloud of bats to become invulnerable and receive a movement speed boost for **3** seconds.
**Twilight Lurker**: Nighttime lingers for **1** more hour after sunrise, and starts **1** hour earlier before nightfall.
  

  
Ageing happens naturally as time passes. Each time you **Drain** a mortal's life, the counter advances for **1** day. **Diablerie** (draining a vampire) advances your age, based on level difference.
  
When you accumulate enough age experience, you will get a popup about it. After that, you will need to sleep in bed to ascend to the new rank. Ageing rate can be adjusted in MCM.
  
  
**[b][color=#8e7cc3][size=4][b][color=#8e7cc3][size=4]♰**[/size][/color][/b] [/size][/color][/b]**Vampirism Skill****[b][color=#8e7cc3][size=4][b][color=#8e7cc3][size=4]♰**[/size][/color][/b][/size][/color][/b]
  
**Vampirism** skill offers three loose branches to develop your undead prowess in. **Vampirism** perk points are separate from regular vanilla perk **AND** from Vampire Lord tree. Freshly turned vampires begin with **2 Vampirism** perk points ready to be invested. You get a new perk point every **5 Vampirism** skill levels, and **2** more each time you advance in **Rank**, for a total of **30** points. That means, the entirety of the **Vampirism** tree is unlockable in one playthrough, but that would require the
  
player to reach both maximum skill level and ascend to highest **Rank**, making the order in which you unlock perks a little more meaningful. A lot of perks come with abilities that let you read a more detailed description of their current effect on your character. Navigate to the Magic Effects menu to see them.
  
  
**Vampirism**experience comes from the use of vampiric spells and powers. As a general rule, more **Vitae** you spend, more experience the action will yield. **Draining** also brings a chunk of **Vampirism**XP. By default, this skill does not contribute to player **level** progression. That can be adjusted in MCM. If you set the multiplier to **1**, that would make **Vampirism** skill contribute the same **level XP** any regular skills. This multiplier is **not** retroactive.

**﻿[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]♰ Vitae ♰[/font]**Most vampiric powers run on stolen blood, in the form of [color=#cc4125]**Vitae**[/color]. It **does not regenerate** naturally, and can only be replenished by feeding on a living mortal or directly absorbing lifeforce through other means. If **Vitae**  drops below **0**, all effects that require it to be maintained end immediately and have to be recast, when **Vitae**  becomes available again (except **Vigor Mortis**, because it is more like a toggleable passive ability). A Fledgling starts with a very limited capacity to hold [color=#cc4125]**Vitae**[/color] in their system, which grows as they advance in **Rank**.
  
However, this is not the only way to expand it.
  
  
 **♰ Vitae Bonus ♰**
  
Feeding on fresh blood temporarily boosts [color=#cc4125]**Vitae**  [/color]capacity by a certain percentage of victim's health. This **temporary** bonus deteriorates over time, but a small percentage of it get absorbed by the Vampire over time and becomes a **permanent** increase in [color=#cc4125]**Vitae**[/color] capacity. The percentage is determined by the method of feeding, more info can be found below.**IMPORTANT** - the **temporary** bonus does **NOT** stack or compound. If you feed again and the *new* potential bonus is **smaller** than your current active bonus, the current bonus remains unchanged. 
  
  
**♰ Vitae Bar ♰**
  
Current **Vitae**  levels can be seen on the **Vitae bar** (new UI element, similar to vanilla health bar). Color of the right portion of the bar ranges from **violet** to **bright orange**, meaning to represent how much **Vitae bonus** you currently have relative the base **Vitae**  (permanently absorbed bonus is included as base). See the **Vitae**  magic effect in magic effects menu to know exact numbers.
  
Bar's position on screen, as well as scale and some other characteristics can be adjusted in the MCM. 
  
  
  
**LESS IMPORTANT, BUT NEVERTHELESS** - When you try to cast certain **Vitae costing** spells and do not have enough [color=#cc4125]**Vitae**[/color], you would get a "**Not enough Magicka**" notification and you **Magicka bar** would flash, as if you do not have enough mana to cast it. This is a temporary tradeoff for a scriptless cost system implementation, that I am hoping to change and make more immersive in a future update.**﻿[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]♰ Feeding ♰[/font]**Consequently, blood drinking is more than a daily chore. Seek out and feed on potent blood to grow stronger over time, or sip on those Volkihar stable capri-suns and miss out on your potential.
  
  
**♰ Hunger ♰**
  
Vampires are ravenously hungry creatures. With each passing day without feeding, **Hunger** will advance for one **Stage**, on average. Starving vampires become less able to use their powers in general, as **Vitae**  capacity shrinks. However, growing bloodlust makes them more voracious, increasing power of **Vampiric Drain** and making it easier to perform a **Combat Drain**.
  
In this sense, Everdamned achieves to strike a balance between vanilla and reverse spell progression. Personally, i dont think vanilla progression (become stronger with Hunger) makes for good gameplay. Vampire becomes generally weaker with Hunger, but to stay lore-friendly and highlight increased bloodlust Vampiric Drain and Combat Drain become more powerful instead.
  
  
**Hunger** has 4 distinct **Stages**:
  
  

  
* **Sated**: **100%** **Vitae**  capacity; **Combat Drain** threshold is **25% Health**.
**Thirsty**: **70%** **Vitae**  capacity; **Combat Drain** threshold is **30% Health**; **Vampiric Drain** base damage increased by **3**.
  
* **Parched**: **50%** **Vitae**  capacity; **Combat Drain** threshold is **40% Health**; **Vampiric Drain** base damage increased by **6**; Cannot **Feed** without **Draining**;
**Bloodstarved**: **40%** **Vitae**  capacity; **Combat Drain** threshold is **50% Health**; **Vampiric Drain** base damage increased by **10**; Cannot **Feed** without **Draining**; **Bloodsense** is free of cost.
  

  
When **Bloodstarved**, your vampiric nature becomes apparent, and you are **hated** and attacked on sight by the common folk. All forms of feeding reset hunger back to **Stage 1**.
  
  
**♰ Avoid detection ♰**
  
As a general rule, feeding in presence other non-vampires will not go unnoticed. If you are caught in the act, it would be considered physical assault and raise an alarm. To spot you, bystanders must be **conscious**, **detect** and have a **line of sight** on you, while being within a certain distance. This distance depends mainly on the **light level** at the time of the act. In general, you should avoid biting people in public in broad daylight. However, **Charm** offers opportunities to feed discreetly in circumstances that otherwise would be too revealing.
  
  
Lethal **drains** would earn you a murder charge, and would be detected as any regular murder would.
  
  
**♰ Quench the thirst ♰**
  
  

  
* **Vampire's Seduction**: Silently bewitches a person, calming them and allowing you to feed. Temporarily boosts **Vitae**  by **20%** of victim's **Health**.
**Thralls**: Volkihar castle maintains a stable of thralls. Feeding on them temporarily boosts **Vitae**  by **20%** of victim's **Health**.
  
* **Sleeping**: Sneak into someone's domicile to feed on them in their sleep. Temporarily boosts **Vitae**  by **30%** of victim's **Health**.
**Charm (Eyes of the Moon perk)**: With a little touch of vampiric charm, seduce your way to victim's throat through conversation. A large number of factors determines the likelihood of a success. Temporarily boosts **Vitae**  by **30%** (first success) to **50%** (Blood Doll) of victim's **Health**, depending on how many times they were successfully seduced.
  
* **Drain**: If your bite was lethal, temporarily boosts **Vitae**  by **50%** of victim's **Health**. An act of draining another **Vampire** is called **Diablerie**, and is only possible through combat at first.

  
Victims need time to replenish the vital liquid. Recuperation period depends on how large was the **%** of **Health** used for **Vitae**  boost. **Draining** is still possible regardless.
  
  
**Combat Drain**
  
Special circumstances allow your to finish off an enemy with a lethal drain. **Combat Drain** becomes available, if your victim is below a certain **Health** threshold, or bleeding out. A visual effect above the target will play to indicate that. To perform a **Combat Drain**, activate the target, while standing still. The threshold depends on your **Hunger Stage**.
  
**KEEP IN MIND** - unlike regular killmoves, **Combat Drain** does **not** make you invulnerable for its duration.
  
  
In some cases (mostly due to Bethesda jank) the animation cannot be played and your grasp will slip, prompting a notification. In general, you must be standing on roughly the same height level as the target, and there should not be any other objects obstructing the space between you. Some strategies to circumvent Skyrim engine jank were implemented, but they can only do so much before making the game unstable.

A vampire does not always have to resort to violence or stealth to sate its thirst. Charming your prey with witty banter and a little touch of hypnosis will earn you an opportunity to take their blood peacefully, leaving them with a vague pleasant memories and blissfully unaware of any biting or feeding taking place.
  
When vampire feeds on a willing target this way, it is much easier to conceal as mere harmless flirtations. For example, an **inn/tavern** is a place where such behavior is natural and excepted, and noone would be suspicious unless you decide to feed literally in front of them. On the contrary, doing that out in the open street would be much harder to conceal, so its best to find a safe spot away from accidental bystanders.
  
  
The quality of nourishment offered by their blood becomes significantly higher as well. Each time you successfully Charm a person, their blood becomes more attuned to you, eventually leading them to become your **Blood Doll**. **Blood Doll's** blood is highly nutritious.
  
  
Success in seduction depends on how eloquent you are (your **Speechcraft** level), weighted against your **relationship** with the person you are trying to seduce. The closer is your relationship, the greater are your chances. Charming a complete stranger is a tall order - something only a true master of speech could pull off, so consider putting in the legwork to befriend them first.
  
  
However, there are **many more** influencing factors - including what you’re wearing, where you are, you and your prey's social standing, its mood, allegiances, and much more. Best way to become better at this IS **doing it**, and paying attention to the cues in form of the dialogue during and after the act. Also, perk comes with a power to **Ruminate** (castable power, available in magic menu) on your past experiences, during which you will also get valuable feedback and advice on how to best develop you allure.
  
  
I tried to design this "minigame" to be understandable through in-game means. However, I do not expect it to work perfectly from Day 1. If this approach did not work quite so well and you feel stuck, please consider the following options:
  
  
1) Drop me a comment so we can make it better 
  
2) Read the .psc script source responsible for Charm score calculation (and spoil all the fun). If you do so, i ask you refrain from posting about its contents so its not spoiled for other, or at least keep it in a spoiler tag

**[color=#8e7cc3][size=4][b] ♰** Blue Blood **♰**[/size][/color][/b]
  
Mechanically it is same as Sacrosanct namesake feature, but with different rewards in mind.
  
Feeding for the first time would start a quest, tasking you to taste the blood of Skyrim's greatest. Doing that is worthwhile, because with their blood you will absorb echoes of extraordinarily lived lives (a number of skill points unique for each Blue Blood flagged NPC). Apart from that, after a second "blue blood" feeding, a new mechanic will be introduced - check spoiler to spoil it.
  
Spoiler
  
[\*] At **2** "blue blood" feedings, you will aquire a **Chained Beast** ability. It is a "second chance" mechanic similar to **Fortitude** from **Sacrosanct**, but with a twist.
  
  
**Chained Beast**
  
It is only active at **Hunger Stage 1**.When you are felled, instead of simply dying like a chump you drop to **Blood-starved** and get up at full Health after a brief delay. But this comes at a price - your Beast awakens. Unless you **exit combat** or **feed** promptly, you will be forcefully transformed into a **Vampire Fleder Beast**. To revert the transformation, you will have to quench the Beast's thirst by feeding - either through **Combat Drain**, which is still available in this transformation, or on a corpse.
  
**IMPORTANT** - **Chained Beast**only works **once per sleep**.
  
  
**Fleder**
  
I've always really enjoyed werewolf form, melee feels uniquely fun, far superior to that of a Vampire Lord. HOWEVER, i like vampires too much :) So it felt like I'm missing out. This is an attempt to fix that by giving access to a**werewolf based** transformation, while making it a part of a larger picture of being a vampire. Transformation retains access to all vampiric powers and abilities, but  not spells, for self-explanatory reasons. Killing mortal NPCs with left hand killmove (werewolf/Fleder devouring the victim) counts as feeding, **Combat Drain** through activation uses this animation as well.
  
 
  
[\*] At **8** "blue blood" feedings, you will be able to attain greater control over your urges and rein in the Beast, transforming **Chained Beast** into **Embrace the Beast**. With it, there will be no more forced transformations, but it will still drop you to **Bloodstarved**. Additionally, you will gain an ability to transform to and from **Fleder** at will, making it an essentially second vampiric transformation.
  
 
  
[\*] At **10** "blue blood" feedings, you will recieve **3** perk points to spend in regular skill trees. If you experience compatibility issues with the second chance mechanic (like you have another mod with a similar feature of just don't like it), it can be turned off in the MCM. Forced transformation is also toggleable.

**Central branch** focuses on archetypal vampiric traits of supernatural **strength**, **speed** and **resilience**. Batter enemies with more force than ever before! Run faster and jump higher than a mere mortal ever could! Shrug off heaviest blows like it's nothing, leave foes biting dust or omae wa mou shindeiru them with blinding speed and razor-sharp reflexes, while keeping things balanced by managing **Vitae**  levels.
  
  

  
* **Fortitude - Vigor Mortis**: Use blood that you have taken to bring vitality back to your flesh and repair damaged tissue - Health regenerates at rate of **1.5%** + **0.2%** for each **Vampiric Rank** per second. Other sources of boosting Health **regeneration** become effective again. Halts when on fire or in direct sunlight. (Cost to maintain: **4 Vitae** when actively regenerating)
**Reflexes - Extended Perception**: Your awareness sharpens and reflexes becomes uncannily precise. Hold Hotkey A to toggle this power on or off. (Cost to maintain: **8 Vitae**)
  
* **Potence - Deadly Strength**: Vampiric strength is as feared as it is supernatural. You passively deal more damage, carry more weight, take less fall damage and can charge a jump by holding **Hotkey B**. Effects grow with age. Activate this power to increase your overall physical damage by an additional **40%** (Costing to maintain: **10 Vitae**)
**Fortitude - Necrotic Flesh**: Your dead flesh hardens, becoming akin to a gargoyle's hide. You take less damage from each physical attack, Fire and Shock resistance is **40%** higher. However, you are encumbered, slowing you by **60%** and making it impossible to sprint and jump high. Effects grow with age. (Cost to maintain: **20 Vitae**)
  
* **Reflexes - Celerity**: For **4** seconds you move with speed so great that to those around you appear as nothing but a blur. Effect grows with age. Tap **Hotkey A** to activate, hold to dispel prematurely. (Cost: **400 Vitae**)
**Potence - Ferocious Surge**: Through channeling your inner Beast you can push your body beyond all physical limits. For **4** seconds you become almost completely tireless, attack **20% faster** and your melee attacks hit all targets in front of you. Lasts longer with age, up to **13** seconds. (Cost: **600 Vitae**)
  
* **Potence - Impetus**: When in **Celerity** and **Deadly Strength** are active, power attacks from behind take an enemy by surprise and carry such momentum they become critical and launch target forward.
**Reflexes - Wicked Wind**: Ultimate expression of vampiric swiftness - in a blink of an eye, appear at target location within 15 feet. Castable only during Celerity. Tapping **Hotkey A** during **Celerity** casts this instead of **Celerity**.
  

  
**Leftmost branch** focuses primarily on **stealth** related mechanics and vampiric **charms**. The power to influence mortal minds and bend their will lies here.
  
  

  
* **Eyes of the Moon**: In conversation, your hypnotic gaze may help you seduce victims and feed on them discreetly. Feeding this way produces a bigger bonus to **Vitae**  than through **Vampire's Seduction**. Bystanders might see through the act, raising alarm. Use **Ruminate** to reflect on how to best develop your allure.
**Vampire's Will**: Directs attention of a living creature away from you for **60** seconds. They are less likely to detect you sneaking, and are oblivious to you feeding on others. Master practitioners of School of Illusion can learn to affect Daedra and Undead. Only works on **1** target at a time.
  
* **Presence**: Your vampiric influence makes Illusion spells up to **40%** stronger and longer, depending on **Vampirism** skill progress. **Vampire's Seduction** works on targets **20** levels higher, if they are affected by a **Calm** spell. Makes intimidation attempts twice as likely to succeed.
**Mesmerize**: Increases duration of **Vampire's Seduction** by **30** seconds and up to **3** minutes total, depending on **Vampirism** skill progress. You now can apply it when seducing through conversation instead of feeding, free of cooldown. Affected, if asked, will follow you, unless you move too far away from them.
  
* **Confusion**: **Vampire's Will** can now put a humanoid target in a state of **Confusion**, creating a distraction that would attract attention of nearby people. Only **1** target can be **Confused** at the same time, and targets become immune to it for a while afterwards. Player must be sneaking and undetected to apply this effect.
**Instinctive Charm**: Upon receiving an unblocked hit, there is a small chance you will retaliate with a **Calming** charm. Effect lasts **15** seconds and has **30** seconds cooldown per person. Only works if attacking group in no smaller than **2** members. Effect can be toggled off.
  
* **Dream Visitor**: Feeding on a sleeping person makes them imprint on you in their dream. Your relationship rank with them increases by **1**. Only works once per person.
**Obfuscate**: Blend into your surroundings, gaining unbreakable invisibility for **60** seconds while sneaking. **Nightstalker** vampires and older do not have to sneak. Ends immediately when hit. (Cost: **300** **Vitae** )
  
* **Masquerade**: Constant low-level charm hides your vampiric features even when they are most apparent. You are no longer hated when **Blood-starved**. It becomes easier to feed without arousing suspicion, as detection radius becomes three times lower.
**Dominate**: Bend mortals to your will. When **Dominate** is active, you may command any mortal to **Stay**, **Follow**, **Flee** or be **Mesmerized**, which places them under the effect of **Vampire's Seduction**. Applied this way, it works on targets up to 50 levels higher. Lasts **60** seconds. (Cost: **400** **Vitae**)
  

**Rightmost branch** is themed around various applications of **Blood Magic** and you delve lets into its secrets through the art of **Hemomancy**. 
  
  
Hemomancy offers ways to deal magic damage over time, enhance your survivability and **Vitae**  management, and even some opportunities for crowd control. All Hemomancy spells require **Vitae**  instead of **Magicka** to be cast. Higher tiers of Hemomancy let you annihilate enemies in spectacular fashion, but those spells cost a lot of **Vitae**. Overall, it is designed to supplement general gameplay and offer powerful non spammable spells.
  
  
Moreover, this branch offers a novel way to **feed** through **Exsanguination**, making it possible to get most effects of a feeding out of non-humanoid creatures.
  
  

  
* **Hemomancy**: Drain a life to unlock this perk and the secret art of Hemomancy, starting with the **Blood Seed** spell. Hemomancy grows up to **50%** stronger with Vampirism skill progression. Most Hemomancy spells have no effect on dwarven automata, ghosts or skeletons.
**Bloodletting**: When you apply **Vampiric Drain**, all targets affected by **Blood Seed** within 20 feet are also drained for **5** Health and **Vitae**  per second.
  
* **Adept Hemomancy**: Using Hemomancy in combat leads to discovery of new spells when you drain a life. Practice the art of Hemomancy to uncover secrets of **Blood Bloom**, **Blood Garden** spells and **Maw** ability.
**Exsanguinate**: **Vampiric Drain** can now be dual cast. Maintaining an unbroken channel on a target that has less than **25%** Health left for **6** seconds will **exsanguinate** it, killing it and counting as a feeding. **Vitae**  capacity cannot be extended this way. Target of the channel cannot die until it is complete or the channel is broken.
  
* **Transfusion**: When cast at an ally, instead of regular effects **Blood Bloom**heals them for **150** health over **2** seconds. If you are sneaking, applies regular **Blood Bloom**effects.
**Expert Hemomancy**: Your understanding of secrets of the blood grows further still. New spells of **Blood Scourge** and **Blood Ankh**, as well as **Blood Tendril** ability can now be learned through continued practice.
  
* **Kindred**: **Transfusion** now also makes its target immune to all other effects of Hemomancy for **8** seconds.
**Vicissitude**: Hemomancy spells do **25%** more damage in form of Health absorption to targets, affected by **Blood Seed**.
  
* **Blood Resonance**: Melee hits on targets affected by a Hemomancy spell regenerate **30** **Vitae**  over **2** seconds. During that time, **Vampiric Drain** is **50%** more effective.
**Master Hemomancy**: Learn how truly devastating mastery over blood can be by discovering **Blood Vortex**, **Blood Boil** and **Borrowed Time** spells.
  

  
Hemomancy spells list is expanded compared to Sacrosanct. **Blood Brand**is reworked into **Blood Bloom**, and **Blood Ankh** is intergrated with **Blood Scourge**. **Profaned Sun** always felt too OP, so now a hemomancer needs ritual sacrifices to conjure it.
  
Hemomancy spells are not learned automatically upon unlocking the perk. Instead, you need to practice Hemomancy spells in combat. After enough practice, your next **Drain** (lethal feeding) will unlock a new spell. Spell order is fixed, and you need the respective perk to unlock a certain spell. Current status of your Hemomancy studies can be seen in Magic Effects menu.
  
  
Complete list of Hemomancy spells and abilities:
  

  
* **Blood Seed**: Jagged bone shards grow in a living or undead target, dealing **4** magic damage for 10 seconds. (Cost: **20** **Vitae**)
**Blood Bloom**: Blossoms **Blood Seed** on a target, inflicting **12** magic damage over **12** seconds. After **6** seconds, a power attack or dropping below **25%** Health triggers a detonation that does magic damage and applies **Blood Seed** in **15** feet area. Cast on a corpse, creates a large pyre that lasts **45** seconds and burns enemies for **15** magic damage. Modified by **Transfusion**, **Kindred** and **Blood Tendril**. (Cost: **50** **Vitae**)
  
* **Blood Garden**: Casts **Blood Seed** on all targets, inflicting **8** magic damage for **10** seconds. (Cost: **80** **Vitae**)
**Maw**: **Vampiric Drain** is **25%** more effective, or **50%** more effective if you have less than **50%** **Vitae**, on targets affected by **Blood Seed**.
  
* **Blood Scourge**: Living or undead target takes **15** magic damage for **15** seconds. On death, spreads to all nearby targets. (Cost: **200** **Vitae**)
**Blood Ankh**: **Blood Scourge** can now be aimed at a corpse or friendly controlled undead. Cast this way, it places a hex, after a brief delay causing target to explode for **200** magic damage.
  
* **Blood Tendril**: A **Blood Tendril** lashes out periodically from the pyre, created by **Blood Bloom**. Those hit are dealt **100** magic damage and knocked prone.
**Blood Vortex**: Perform a profane ritual to conjure a bloodstorm in a **25** feet area for **60** seconds. Victims suffer **5** magic damage. Storm claims those who perish, lasting **20** more seconds. After **3** deaths it collapses into **Profaned Sun** that burns for **25** magic damage per second for **30** seconds, hounding the closest **Blood Seed** victim. (Cost: **300** **Vitae**)
  
* **Blood Boil**: A living target burns for **5** magic damage for **12** seconds. At half Health, blood boils in their veins, leading to an unpreventable violent explosion that knocks everyone down and deals **500** magic damage in a large area. Only **1** victim can burn at a time. (Cost: **600** **Vitae**)
**Borrowed Time**: Deals **5** magic damage for **20** seconds to a living or undead target. When time runs out, deals damage equal to all **Health** lost by the target during this time. (Cost: **400 Vitae**)
  

Other perks:
  

  
* **Preservation**: Learn to create **Blood Potions** by drawing them from thralls or with cooking station recipes. Skilled alchemists will be able to refine the formula to produce a much more potent **Blood Wine**. Requires **Vigor Mortis** and **Hemomancy** perks to be unlocked. \*
**Auspex**: In mortal form, your supernatural senses warn you of the presence of enemies within 70 feet, briefly illuminating them through walls. Enemies can only be illuminated once and enemies that are too close are not detected. Requires **Extended Perception** and **Presence** to be unlocked.
  

  
**Hotkeys**
  
Everdamned comes with two hotkeys, referenced as **Hotkey A** and **Hotkey B**. By default, they are bound to the **X** and **V** buttons, but can be remapped in MCM.
  
Effects of these hotkeys, however, cannot be altered. They are mostly meant to streamline access to toggleable abilities (it is a great hassle to manage them otherwise), and access the Charged Jump mechanic.
  
  
Effects of these Hotkeys are as follows:
  

  
* **Hotkey A**: Hold to toggle **Extended Perception**. Tap to cast **Celerity**. Tap when in **Celerity** to cast **Wicked Wind**. **LSHIFT** + Tap to cast **Darkwing Dash**.
**Hotkey B**: Tap to toggle **Deadly Strength**. **LSHIFT** + Tap to toggle **Necrotic Flesh**. Hold to **Charge Jump**.
  

  
Any effects listed will only be applied if player has them unlocked already. For example, you cannot cast **Celerity**, if you have not yet unlocked the respective perk.
  
  
\* *There is a secret third effect of **Preservation** perk. Check spoiler to see:*
  
Spoiler
  
If you have progressed Skyrim's main quest enough and Septimus gave you the **Essence Extractor**, you can use it on **Blood Dolls** to extract a more potent version of **Blood Potion**. You do not need to have the item in your inventory to do that. Option to bypass main quest requirement exists in the MCM.

First and foremost, you are a member of **Volkihar** bloodline, and Vampire Lord form is an ultimate expression of that. Lore suggests that vampires of this lineage are uniquely gifted in the arts of Necromancy, can hide under a sheet of ice and grab prey from under it and also their breath is icy? Regardless, it is not reflected much in vanilla design.
  
In Everdamned, Vampire Lords have access to more necromancy options. Additionally, since the bloodline is a direct gift from Molag Bal itself, some of the powers are inspired by that connection to Coldharbour and give access to a summoner-like archetype. Let minions do the dirty work, as any true Lord would!
  
  
Overall, playing as Vampire Lord should feel powerful and worthy of the title. It is not a solution for every situation and cannot be used in every scenario, but when the time is right, it should feel fun and different from regular gameplay. To make magic form less spammy, **Vampiric Drain** was slightly nerfed to make way for other spells and abilities. Melee-focused powers from **Vampirism** tree, as well as from Vampire Lord's own tree, will provide more incentives to descend.
  
  
Vampire Lords start with these spells:
  

  
* **Vampiric Drain**: Explosion of vampiric energy that absorbs **10 (level 0) - 16 (level 50) Health** and **Vitae**  and deals **25** - **40** magic damage.
**Lord's Servant**: Reanimate a corpse up to level **13** for **10** minutes.
  
* **Bats**: Dash in your direction of movement. Has **2** charges.

When in Vampire Lord form, you are hated, and direct sunlight is immediately **scorching** irrespective of current **Vitae**  level.
  
  
Feel the power of the ancient blood coursing through your veins with a selection of **23** perks, available for purchase in the Vampire Lord form. Perk points here are separate from **Vampirism** perk tree, and can be obtained through traditional method of absorbing victim **Lifeblood** by biting them or killing with form's version of **Vampiric Drain**. Biting produces **3** times more Lifeblood than killing with a drain spell. **2** Vampire Lord perk points are awarded when you advance in **Rank** (if you become Vampire Lord when already a vampire, those perk points are retroactive).
  
   ﻿
  

  
* **Royal Bloodline**: All attributes (Health, Magicka, Stamina) are increased by **50** points as Vampire Lord. Choose an attribute to further increase by **100** points.
**Unearthly Will**: Your vampiric spells and powers, except for **Vigor Mortis**, cost **50%** less in when in a vampiric transformation. **Vampiric Drain** costs **50%** less Magicka in mortal form. **Lord's Servant** can now raise corpses of level equal to your **Vampirism** skill. Grants access to a lesser version of **Lord's Servant** in mortal form.
  
* **Fountain of Life**: Killing a person in melee with a bite attack in all forms form fully restores all your attributes. Draining a victim in mortal form counts towards Vampire Lord perk progression.
**Wings of the Strix**: In magic mode, sprinting allows you to glide, greatly reducing fall speed.
  
* **Night Cloak**: In combat, you are surrounded by a cloud of bats that feed on living enemies within melee range, absorbing **5** points of Health per second from each. Weakened foes suffer reduced damage, but may get staggered instead.
**Raze**: Cast a wave of blood that cuts through targets in a line, absorbing **15** - **25** Health and dealing **35** - **60** additional magic damage, based on your level. Permanently replaces standard Vampire Lord right hand spell.
  
* **Tremble**: If standing still and claws are drawn, ground landing emits a **shockwave** that throws all within **2** feet into the air. Cooldown: **30** seconds.
**Royal Guardian**: Upon entering combat, first time when an enemy enters an area within **30** feet of you, from the depths of Coldharbour a fierce guard dog emerges to protect you. It will be banished from this world when combat ends.
  
* **Amaranth**: Henceforth, don the Royal armor. **Vampire's Seduction** works on vampires, and draining humanoid vampires will absorb their power. Your reward for this depraved act is now a **30%** bonus to combat and social skills while weaker vampires flee from you, for **5** minutes.
**Subjugate Undead**: **Lord's Servant** spell now allows you to dominate a weaker hostile undead, placing it under your command. You can only control **1** target this way. Does not count against summon limit. **Vampire's Will** now works on undead. (Cost: **200 Vitae**)
  
* **Marching Flesh**: Channel necrotic energy to empower commanded undead for **30** Health per second and **30%** movement speed. Exposure for **6** seconds grants them **Unholy Strength**. It increases Health and Stamina by **50**, attack speed for **20%** for **15** seconds, and resets reanimation duration. (Cost: **30 Magicka**, **30 Vitae**)
**Undying Loyalty**: Charge **Lord's Servant** for **3** seconds to increase its magnitude **twofold**, and make reanimated thrall last indefinitely and not disintegrate on death. Upon reverting to mortal form, the thrall will be displaced to the realm of Coldharbour and wait there for you to put on a mantle of Vampire Lord once again. (Cost: **300 Vitae**)
  
* **Shambling Hordes**: Curse the ground around target area, bringing all of the dead lying upon it to animation for **40** seconds. Raised this way do not count against summon limit. Corpses disintegrate when the effect ends. (Cost: **300 Magicka, 800 Vitae**)
**Conjure Gargoyle**: Conjure a gargoyle to fight for you for **60** seconds. Available in mortal form as well. (Cost: **50 Magicka**, **100 Vitae**)
  
* **Sacrificial Pyre**: Channel for **20** Frost damage, engulfing target in cold-flames to be sent to Coldharbour upon death as tribute. A minion will be summoned for **30** seconds shortly after, that will not be counted towards your summon limit. Works on corpses, does not work on dragons. (Cost: **20 Magicka**, **20 Vitae**)
**Icy Winds**: Volkihar's breath is said to freeze victim's blood in the veins. Concentrate to freeze the ground beneath you, making it hazardous. After **4** seconds of channel, release the spell to launch forward an **icy storm**, dealing **100** Frost damage and staggering or knocking victims down. (Cost: **35 Magicka**, **40 Vitae** per second of channel)
  
* **Echolocation**: Sends out a quick pulse that detects any creature. (Cost: **15 Magicka**)
**Leeching Poison**: Attacks in melee form deliver an unnatural toxin, dealing **25** points of poison damage and absorbing **50** points of **Magicka** and **Vitae**  over **5** seconds.
  
* **Mist Form**: Disperse into a dark mist for **15** seconds, becoming undetectable and invulnerable but unable to fight while regenerating **25** points of Health, Magicka and Stamina per second. Has **30** seconds cooldown.
**Chokehold**: Concentrate to pull a creature to you from a distance, absorbing **20** points of Health and Stamina per second when it is close. Can **Exsanguinate** victims, if you have the perk. Does not cost **Vitae**  during **Exsanguination**. (Cost: **50 Magicka**, **20 Vitae**)
  
* **Gutwrench**: Concentrate to absorb **5** points of Health per second from nearby living foes. Uninterrupted exposure builds up **25** points of agony per second on each foe, tearing them apart when it exceeds their remaining Health. (Cost: **25 Magicka**, **10 Vitae**)
**Parting Gift**: **Chokeholding** a corpse or a reanimated undead minion places a hex on them. In **4** seconds they explode violently, damaging all targets in **15** feet for **200** magic damage. Release **Chokehold** to hurl them forward.
  
* **Maelstorm**: Create an imploding vortex that pulls all within **50** feet into the center, stunning them and reducing magic resistance by **50%** for **3** seconds. (Cost: **150 Magicka**, **400 Vitae**)

**[color=#8e7cc3][size=4][b]♰** General guidance**♰**[/size][/color][/b]
  
**Hard incompatibility**: other vampirism overhauls, like Sacrosanct, Vampiric Thirst ports, Better Vampires etc. They are meant to modify same gameplay elements and would break each other.
  
**Hard incompatibility**: any other mods, that overwrite vanilla vampire scripts like **playervampirequestscript.pex**and others. For example, if you have Vampire Feed Proxy with Better Vampires compatibility installed, it would break Everdamned. In most cases, it can be avoided by placing Everdamned at the bottom of the load order (let it overwrite any other mods)
  
  
**Compatible**: mods that change vampire appearance, like DVA, Vampire Lord Overhaul etc. Everdamned does not edit any vanilla race or NPC records to keep it as compatible with such mods as possible.
  
**Compatible**: mods that change NPC vampires. Everdamned does not aim to change NPC vampires in any meaningful way, maybe at some point in the future. Personally i'd recommend using [Better Vampire NPCs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9510) by Brehanin. Just make sure Everdamned overwrites it or other potentially conflicting mods
  
**Possibly Incompatible**: mods, related to feeding, l like Vampire Feeding Tweaks. Everdamned already covers feeding mechanics extensively, and in vanilla feeding the game does not have info about the victim, so it is not possible to calculate Vitae bonus and etc. Compatibility patches will have to be made, feel free to request some/ask about compatibility in the posts tab.
  
  
**[color=#8e7cc3][size=4][b]♰** Known (in)compatibilities**♰**[/size][/color][/b]
  
**Compatible** (if mod is not here, does **not** mean it is not compatible):

  
* Dynamic Vampire Appearance - native support
Vampire Feed Proxy - patch available in the FOMOD
  
* Vampire Animations - works with Vampire Feed Proxy patch AND Vampire Feed Decals installed
Ordinator, Adamant, Path of Sorcery - patches available
  
* Survival Mode - patches available
Race Compatibility with fixed for SSE - patch available. MAKE SURE Everdamned overwrites RC
  
* Race Compatibility SKSE (RCS) - patch available. MAKE SURE Everdamned overwrites RCS
Vampire Feeding Tweaks - patch available,adds only Sneak feed and Corpse feed
  
* Sun Affects NPCs Vampires - carefully read instructions in Everdamned FOMOD

  
**Not Recommended**: These mods will not irreparably break the game if installed with Everdamned, but some bad
  
interactions are known to happen, so hence this list: 
  
  
[Wheeler](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97345): it has a bug that breaks the game timescale, if you open Wheeler menu during a Slow Time effect. It is a bug of a wheeler and cannot be fixed on Everdamned side, and Everdamned features time slow effects, so that might become an issue. But, the problem fixes itself once the Time Slow effect ends, so Wheeler still can be used, albeit with caution.
  
  
**UPD:**a [fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/166848) by [Shenawy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/67625701) is now available! I havent tested it myself yet, but it should resolve this issue
  
 
  
**ENB presets**: most ENB presets are known to cause problems with color modifying part of Imagespace Modifiers. Everdamned features Imagespace Modifiers for spells and powers VFX, so you might not get the intended look. Same goes for most other gameplay mods, so unless you are a screen archer and/or need a specific ENB, consider investigating this matter and switching to a preset that does not break Imods, like True Vision. Or, better yet, use Community Shaders.
  
  
[Predator Vision](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2777): Everdamned implements similar features in a more performance friendly way, and has them integrated with gameplay mechanics. Also, it seems long abandoned and has several bugs : (
  
  
[Conjuration Limit Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/117155): currently, if Everdamned detects its presence, summon/reanimate spells that are listed as not counting towards summon limit DO count towards summon limit (because Everdamned conflicts with this mod and disables feature in its presence). Integration is planned in a future update.
  
  
[Spell Hotbar](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/110763)﻿: when cast through Hotbar, spells that should cost **Vitae** will not actually deduct Vitae. It is a limitation of the approach, Everdamned custom Vitae cost system cannot detect casts through Papyrus, which the Hotbar uses
  
  
Installation
  
  
WARNING - this game was developed and tested on (currently latest) **Anniversary Edition** **v. 1.6.1179.0**. It ***s******hould*** ***probably*** work for Skyrim SE (1.5.X) and most likely works for all other AE versions, and I encourage you to try it out and report any issues
  
**VERY IMPORTANT**- Everdamned cannot be installed properly on an existing save, where player character is **already a vampire**. Some things are bound to break and there is little I can do to help you troubleshoot, because everybody has different modlists. If you encounter a problem on a mid-playthrough install, please try to replicate it on a fresh gamesave.

In latter case, they can be found in a dedicated **\*\_imported** folder in **/meshes/Everdamned** or **/textures/Everdamned**. Important to note, 90% of them are not copied as is, but modified by me to some degree, sometimes they are not recognizable anymore, but I decided to leave them where they are for convenience.

[NoahBoddie](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/NoahBoddie/mods) for all his work, and especially the [Actor Value Generator](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/84743?tab=description)﻿. A powerhouse of a mod, Everdamned would have been much more scripted and worse without it, if possible at all
  
  
Wonderful [series of tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/@SkyrimScripting) on SKSE plugins by [mrowrpurr](https://www.nexusmods.com/profile/mrowrpurr)﻿- would have probably not braved the jump without 
  
  
[MaybeAsrak](https://www.nexusmods.com/profile/MaybeAsrak/mods)'s [Conjuration Limit Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/117155) source, because I forked it to start my own plugin :)

No gen AI was used in creation of this mod, other than unsuccessful (and unused) attempts to make it write dialogue for me (i am not a native speaker and need all the help i can get)

**Q: No sneak feeding?**
  
A: Yes, Everdamned does not feature an option to sneak feed. Honestly, I just don't understand the idea of "sneakily feeding on a conscious person". I will try to find a place for it in coming updates, suggestions are welcome.
  
  
**Q: I want to report a bug/crash.**
  
A: Please describe the circumstances of the problem in as much detail as possible. Make sure to include crash logs in case of a crash and/or Papyrus logs. If you do not have crash logs or do not know where to get them, see [this mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59818). For Papyrus logs, see [this article](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/articles/368).
  
  
**Q: I want to suggest a compatibility patch.**
  
A: Suggestions are welcome, try to describe what mod you want to make Everdamned compatible with is about and which features must be made compatible, so I can prioritize.
  
  
**Q: Seduction feeding animation / combat drain animation did not play, why?**
  
A: I wish I knew why. Sometimes, for god knows what reasons, Skyrim engine decides that you cannot play idles (sometimes even solo idles) in a particular spot. Try a different spot.
