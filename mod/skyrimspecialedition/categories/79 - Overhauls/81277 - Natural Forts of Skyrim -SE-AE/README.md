**[font=Courier New]" Behold, your new fort upgrade. [/font]**[font=Courier New]Hello Skyrim and her people, Retrophyx here today revealing a mod I have been hording on for some time now. Ok. Check this out, alright. So you know those boring and flat Forts all across Skyrim? I thought they could use some 21st century zip and pip to match the 2023 quality of life landscape[/font][/font]*[font=Comic Sans MS][font=Courier New]. So here it is. Skyrim finally gets some decent aesthetics to their Forts. [/font][/font]*"
  
  
  
(amazing coverage from you guys)[/size]

[size=6]   WHAT MOD INCLUDES
  
  
**\* new standalone models to all the major Forts in the game -Towers and exterior walls.

[size=5]WHAT THIS MOD AVOIDS
  
  
**This mod is 100% Navmesh safe, it does not touch any Navmesh, instead it is built around the base game.
  
Thanks to [ItzIvy](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/ItzIvy/mods?gameId=1704)﻿ advice, Navcuts are now included.
  
Which makes it possible for npcs to detect the new walls.
  
  
This mod does not cause any problems to performance or crashes. Safe to install anytime.
  
Results may vary depending on your own mod lists (i.e. fort overhauls).
  
0 doors or interiors to keep this add-on more simple.**

[size=6] COMPATIBLE
  
  
**This mod ONLY adds new standalone models to your game.
  
There shouldn't be any problems with other mod conflicts, CTDs, navmesh, or scripts.
  
Cleaned with xedit and made with compatibility in mind.****+compatible with any Fort retexture
  
+compatible with fort replacers
  
like Imperial Castles of Skyrim****Obviously Not compatible with mods that alter fort layouts.**+option available for Ryns Broken Tower Redoubt.
