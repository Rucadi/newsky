**What is Magicka Flow?****Magicka Flow** is a mod, which allows you to take control of your **Magicka Regeneration**. In the vanilla game, when you enter combat, your Magicka regeneration gets immediately reduced by **67%**. This means, even **potions** and **other sources**, that increase **Magicka Regeneration** get **reduced**. For me, this is not immersive and also does nothing for gameplay. It's not interactive and you have no control.
  
  
This mod allows you to take control of that. You can manage your **Magicka Regeneration** in a very easy and immersive way.
  
  
This mod was supposed to be a feature of [SkyValor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106240) but in the end, I decided to release it as a standalone mod.
  
  
**How does it work?**This mod has two modes for Magicka regeneration, primarily functioning through the act of sheathing your spells. Modes can be switched at any time with MCM.
  
  
  
**Mode 0**
  
This mode is similar to Vanilla Skyrim, except that you can now also tweak it with MCM!
  
**(Make sure to sheathe/draw your spells again, after making changes in MCM)**
  
**Combat Regen with spells ready** - Default 0.33 - Your Magicka Regeneration is reduced by 67%
  
**Combat Regen while spells are sheathed** - Default 1.00 - Your Magicka Regeneration is no longer reduced.
  
  
You can also tweak it to increase Magicka Regeneration while in combat, when your spells are sheathed. Setting **Combat Regen while spells are sheathed** to will increase your Magicka Regeneration by 5 times.
  
  
  
**Mode 1 (Independent from Combat State)
  
[b]This is independent from your combat state, which means, it doesnt matter if you are in combat or not.**[/b]
  
Wielding a spell with this mode will reduce the **Magicka Regeneration** by a flat amount per spell wielded(Not sheathed). Depending on the version used, this can vary. But the basic version is **50%**. In addition to that, **good positioning** and **standing still**, rewards you and provides a **+30%** **Magicka Regeneration Bonus**.
  
  
  
  
**Comparison and more detailed explanation between Vanilla and the new Modes**
  
As an example, you wear a Mage Robe, which gives you **50%** **Magicka Regeneration**. The basic **Magicka Regeneration** amount is **100%**. So you have a total of **150%** **Magicka Regeneration**. We will use the 150% as an example for Vanila Skyrim and the different modes.
  
**Vanilla Skyrim**
  
In Vanilla Skyrim, you would end up with **150%****\*****0.33** = **49.5%** as soon as you enter combat and you also can't influence that.
  
  
  
**Mode 0****Combat Regen with spells ready** - 0.0
  
**Combat Regen while spells are sheathed**-  5.0
  
  
While in combat, with your spells ready, you will have **150%****\*****0.0** = **No Magicka Regeneration**
  
While in combat, with your spells sheathed, you will have **150%****\*****5.00** = **750****%** **Magicka Regeneration**

**Combat Regen with spells ready** - 0.33
  
**Combat Regen while spells are sheathed**-  1.0
  
  
While in combat, with your spells ready, you will have **150%****\*****0.33** = **49.5% Magicka Regeneration**
  
While in combat, with your spells sheathed, you will have **150%****\*****1.00** =**150****%** **Magicka Regeneration**
  
  
This means, you regenerate less Magicka, while wielding your spells, but sheating your spells will allow you to regenerate Magicka like, if you were not im combat.
  
  
With this mode, you can create a new gameplay for your Mage Character!
  
  
  
**Mode 1 [b][size=4](Independent from Combat State)**[/b][/size]
  
**This is independent from your combat state, which means, it doesnt matter if you are in combat or not.**
  
Wielding one spell readied in your hand will reduce the Magicka Regeneration by a **flat 50%** per spell.
  
With this mode you end up with **150%**- **50% \* Spells readied** = **100%** or **50%** when wielding two spells at the same time. You can **sheathe** the spell(s) you are wielding and the **Magicka Regeneration** will be again at **150%**.
  
  
There are optional patches available which require SkyPatcher, which will tweak the amount of Magicka Regeneration reduction. **The base version is 50%**.
  
  

**Example with 150% Magicka Regeneration -100% while wielding two spells. Notice, how Magicka regenerates faster after sheating.**

**Example with 100% Magicka Regeneration -100% while wielding two spells. Magicka starts regenerating only after sheating spells.**

**Install**
  
Install the latest version of this mod.
  
Install the latest version of [SkyPatcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106659) if you are using an option, which modifies the amount for Mode 1.
  
**If you apply a Patch for Mode 1, make sure to change the modes, to re-apply the spells, so that they have the correct values.**
  
**Example**
  
You already installed this mod and you switched to Mode 1 with MCM. You notice, you want a bigger penalty and download a SkyPatcher Patch for this mod. Download the patch, activate it. Now go ingame, open the Magicka Flow MCM. Switch to Mode 0 and then go back to Mode 1. The mod will remove all the spells and re-apply them with the new correct values.
  
  
  
**Uninstall**
  
You can uninstall the mod at any point, but as always, it's advised to revert to a save, where the mod was not installed.
