**NOT an enemy AI overhaul**
  
  
Do you live in a populated city and notice that the NPCs are a bit dull and robotic like? 
  
Well, well you've stumbled upon a mod that tends to fix many of these issues and further increase immersion and realism to the game. 
  
  
Getting tired of NPCs doing the exact same thing everyday like robots? 
  
-Why is it they Say they do things but really don't .\_. 
  
-Why do some people say pointless things to you at random? 
  
-Why does everyone engage in combat if one vampire enters the city? 
  
-And Isn't it strange for people to wander the streets after 12 midnight? Or Stay up at 3 a.m when theres NOTHING for them to be doing.(for most people)

-Highly noticeable tweaks & rewrites many of the vanilla NPCs AI 
  
-More Idle areas
  
-Realistic behaviors 
  
-Fixed bedtimes 
  
-Minds of their own. For the god’s sake no more robots! 
  
-Optional use of scripts.
  
  
**Install/Uninstall:**
  
AIO uses a FOMOD for use with mod managers. VR users should use Lite version.
  
Manual install 1 .esp file only to Data folder.
  
Not recommended to uninstall midplay regardless of version.
  
  
**AI Tweaks & Behaviors:**
  
*Note: -not every NPC has tweaked AI due to certain quests and playing purposes.*
  
"Branches and Procedures can all have Conditions, you can create very complex switches to route AI behavior through."
  
  
Every day in Skyrim is really a unique day for (almost) everyone now. 
  
  
- When NPCs have free time they can be doing whatever. And no not sandbox one area they really could be doing anything. They may be at different parts of the city, Shopping or at home. 
  
  
- Not every NPC will randomly greet you. I mean not everyone I walk by in my life stops to greet me. 
  
  
- NPCs interact more with the environment around them. They may read a letter or book, search containers, drink, eat, observe, etc.
  
  
-If a family member dies, the surviving family member(s) will visit their grave.
  
  
-Spousal freedom in walled cities. Can be found around town and in shops. They may go out every night & will always return home by 9pm
  
  
- Fixed bedtimes. beggars now sleep on the street, or in a tavern basement. Most people will be in their homes by 10PM-12AM 
  
  
- Most NPCs will not engage in combat. They will run away from danger. (any danger, even you!)
  
  
-Weather behavior for all individuals
  
  
**Please see Documentation for more details.**
  
  
**Troubleshooting:**
  
If you experience issues with movement and lip syncing be aware that in some cases (especially with population mods) too many NPCs will go over
  
the limit of AI working correctly in a cell. Examples: NPC’s Standing still,
  
NPCs floating, NPCs face frozen. By default this number is 20, I changed that
  
to 30.
  
Recommend mod if you exceed that limit: [Increase Actors in a cell](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6270/.popup-topic?tab=posts) or [Actor Limit Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32349)﻿
  
  
NPCs do nothing after they were in a scene. –Reset AI or "RecycleActor then Resurrect” them using the console command to refresh them.
  
  
Most common problem this mod has are conflicts with other mods that usually have edited NPCs or AI, and most of the time this mod will often get mixed up with third party conflicts, so again make sure all your mods work in harmony (for the most part).
  
  
This should not affect your FPS heavily.
