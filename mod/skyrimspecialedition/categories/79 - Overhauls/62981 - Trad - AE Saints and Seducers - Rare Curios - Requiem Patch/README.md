Compatibility
  
This mod changes the smithing skill tree. Any other mod that changes this will require a compatibility patch.
  
 I have created a compatibility patch for ‘Requiem - Dragonborn Patch’.
  
I have created a compatibility patch for 'Skyrim Extended Cut - Saints and Seducers' it must be loaded after Fozar's Dragonborn patch if installed, more details below.
  
  
  
Notable changes
  
The Daedra Golden Saints are overhauled. They have enchanted shock weapons, a shock aura, armor penetration 50%, resist magic 50%, resist shock 60%. They also drop daedra hearts on death.
  
The Daedra Dark Seducers are overhauled. They have enchanted absorb health weapons, a drain aura that will absorb health and stamina (requiem drain counters apply), armour penetration 50%, resist magic 50%. They also drop daedra hearts on death.
  
The summon spells are balanced for requiem. Saint and Seducer warriors are master level spells. Saint and Seducer archers are expert level spells.
  
The scrolls of summon saint/seducer are unchanged and very powerful.
  
Saints and Seducers bandits will be superior to standard bandits with strength and skill more comparable to professional soldiers and better equipment.
  
Saints and Seducers bandit bosses will be slightly stronger but are only human and so do have not have exceptionally high health or stats. 
  
Elytra are equivalent of tiny frosbite spiders. Their poison has a similar strength duration and has the Requiem visual effects. They have 20% magic weakness as in oblivion.
  
The corrupted spriggans are now equivalent to requiems spriggan matrons.
  
The Final Boss Thoron has more health and magicka (should be around 1600 health). He also has two of the new daedra as bodyguards. As a result of his quest script he has a poor detection range.
  
 
  
The new dungeon has a single re spawning saint and seducer added into it in addition to Thorons bodyguards. In my testing I beat the dungeon around level 30 with Serana as a companion and appropriate potions. It is meant to be challenging as a gateway to the powerful rewards.
  
 
  
The Sword of Jyggalag is the equivalent of a daedric greatsword. It is now a daedric artifact that is enchanted to battle daedra. The logic is that as a powerful being of order Jyggalag was feared by and fought against the other daedra so his weapon is suited for this purpose:
  
Banish effect lvl 35 for 3 sec.
  
 ‘Unresistable’ damage 120 daedra.
  
 2 damage over 6 sec against daedra and if Fozar’s dragonborn patch and the compatibility patch are installed this will reduce lurker and seeker health regeneration.
  
 
  
Madness and Amber gear now requires its own perk ‘Shivering Isles Smithing’ which requires level 100 smithing and Evethra’s Journal to have been read.
  
Amber gear: Weapons are daedric in damage but lighter, bow is light and equivalent to Auriels bow in damage. Armor has the same rating as dragonscale. Bonus ratings: ranged 3.
  
Madness gear: Weapons are just above daedric in damage and heavier. Armor has the same rating as daedric. Bonus ratings: Ranged 5.
  
My logic for the strength of the gear is based on its rating in oblivion and that it is essentially a type of daedric gear, being forged from pieces of oblivion.
  
 
  
Seducer armor is equal to scaled but heavier. Bonus Rating: Ranged 2.
  
Saint armor is equivalent to steel plate. Bonus Rating: Ranged 5.
  
The armor still requires the standard daedric perk to craft and its value is more aesthetic than useful.
  
Seducer one handed weapons deal damage equal to glass, two handed weapons (bow included) equal to dwarven. These weapons count as daedric and so will do bonus damage to daedra and can hurt ghosts. The high damage, rarity, daedra hearts required to craft and daedric nature of the weapons is the reason for their high value.
  
Golden two handed weapons deal damage equal to glass, one handed weapons equal to dwarven. These weapons count as daedric and so will do bonus damage to daedra and can hurt ghosts. The high damage, rarity, daedra hearts required to craft and daedric nature of the weapons is the reason for their high value.
  
 
  
Nerveshatter is equivalent to a madness war hammer. This is based off its power in oblivion. Taking Nerveshatter will now cause three golden saints to spawn and attack.
  
  
Rare Curios
  
Ingredients and the power of their effects were adjusted with the following logic:
  
Ingredients from Tamerial - standard strength.
  
Ingredients from powerful monsters in Tamerial -  slightly stronger.
  
Ingredients from the oblivion realms - slightly stronger.
  
Ingredients from daedra - extremely strong and more expensive than daedra hearts. This is because daedra hearts would be one of the more common ingredients from creatures of oblivion.
  
 
  
The spell absorption alch effect is probably the most overpowered in the rare curios. I have adjusted it to 20% spell absorption. Base duration is now between 10 and 15, except for daedra venin which is 60. Only daedra venin has 30% spell absorption.
  
  
Skyrim Extended Cut - Saints and Seducers Spoiler
  
I have released an optional patch for the Skyrim Extended Cut - Saints and Seducers. This is aimed to be high difficulty, high reward expereience. If you are looking for an less extreme experience you may want to check out IxionXVII's Requiem Patch for the extended cut https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78991.
  
  
 Fozars Dragonborn if installed must be loaded before the patch as Fozars patch can break the Scene with Thoron and Dylora otherwise. Fozar's patch alters Miraak's torture spell which is used in a scene in the extended cut and will cause it to break if not fixed; because of which this patch must load after Fozar's.
  
My experience in testing the Extended Cut is that any time their is a scene involving Thoron it may start to bug in some way. I advise saving before any encounter or entering a cell with Thoron and reloading or rebooting the game if issues persist. It is defiantly possible to finish the quest properly but the quest is rather prone to glitching as of this time and is not due to my patch.
  
  
There is a compatibility patch for the artifacts "Ruins Edge, Shadowrend and Staff of Sheogorath" on the Trad - AE - CC - Collection - Requiem Patch mod page as optional files.
  
  
The Sword of Jyggalag can now be retrieved after Thoron's 'death'.
  
A manual for crafting Golden and Dark gear can be bought from Theodor Gorlash titled 'Aureal and Mazken Craftsmanship'.
  
Sees-the-Moon sells food and drink if needed.
  
  
All except 2 of the dead Saints and Seducers have already been looted of their hearts and most armor.
  
  
Flesh Atronach: Powerful daedra that cast fire spells and mage armor. They regenerate health quickly except when taking shock damage or their magicka falls below 25%. They are daedra not undead, they are resistant to blunt and ranged like undead but their weakness is daedric/golden/dark weapons instead of silver. They are fairly vulnerable to stagger if you can close the distance. A master pickpocket can remove their void essence to instantly kill them. They are resistant to fire and frost but weak to shock.
  
  
Grummites: Unarmored brutes. They use strong but crude weapons that they often enchant. Grummite weapons have the damage of orcish but weight of daedric.
  
  
Hunger: These daedra have an armored carapace and an aura that can absorb stamina very fast. Unlike seducers hungers only absorb stamina but they do so faster. Fighting in melee ranged is not advisable. Stronger hungers can absorb stamina even faster. Count as daedra and weak to daedric weapons and resistant to magic. The claws of a hunger are poisonous and can paralyze their prey, blocking can prevent the paralysis but it is hard to block when your stamina is being drained.
  
  
Scalons: Large scaled creatures, with high health but low armor. They can turn invisible to ambush their prey.
  
  
Gnarls: They regenerate health quickly like spriggans. If they take fire, frost or shock damage for the next 5 seconds they will become stronger, their health regen will pause and they will become immune to that element and weak to the other two.
  
  
Elytra: slightly stronger than frostbite spiders and their poison drains magicka instead of stamina.
  
  
Amber Atronach: A strong brute with tough natural armor and surprisingly fast. It is resistant to magic. It relies purely on physical strength in battle.

Issues
  
If installed into an existing game, npc health and magicka changes may not change accordingly. This is most noticeable with Thoron who due to his short range detection script (from the quest) can easily be one shot before he can react  if he does not have increased health. If you find Thoron spawned with below 1500 health you can add ‘Trad\_AbThoron’ to his actor effects in SSEEdit if you wish to make him closer to his intended strength.
