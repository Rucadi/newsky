**Scion - A Vampire O****v[b]erhaul**[/b]

Scion is a complete overhaul of Skyrim’s Vampire system designed to balance existing Vampire mechanics and add powerful new vampiric abilities to the game. Vanilla Vampirism is neither deep nor engaging. Its passives and Greater Powers are weighted towards Stage 4, meaning the quickest way to "level up" is to simply ignore Vampirism entirely. By contrast, Scion is designed to make both Stage 1 and Stage 4 desirable for different builds. It also overhauls the Vampire Lord’s perk tree and its level-based scaling to ensure that the Vampire Lord stays powerful and fun to use throughout the whole game.
  
  
**Vampire Stages**
  
  
All Vampires benefit from a number of passive abilities based on the stage of their Vampirism. In general, both buffs and debuffs grow stronger as the Vampire progresses towards Stage 4. 
  
  
**Spoiler***Stage 1 Vampires have the following abilities:* 
  
  

  
* [color=#dd7e6b]**Supernatural Resistance -** Your Frost Resistance is increased by 50%, and your Poison and Disease Resistance are increased by 100%.
  
**Weakness to Fire -** Your Fire Resistance is reduced by 50%.
  
- **Weakness to Sunlight -** While exposed to sunlight, your Health, Magicka, and Stamina Regeneration are reduced by 100%.
  
*Stage 2 Vampires have the following abilities:*
  
  

  
* **Undeath -** You resist 10% of incoming weapon damage, but healing spells are 50% less effective.
**Supernatural Resistance -** Your Frost Resistance is increased by 50%, and your Poison and Disease Resistance are increased by 100%.
  
* **Weakness to Fire -** Your Fire Resistance is reduced by 50%.
**Weakness to Sunlight -** While exposed to sunlight, your Magicka and Stamina are reduced by 25, and your Health, Magicka, and Stamina Regeneration are reduced by 100%.
  

  
*Stage 3 Vampires have the following abilities:*
  
  

  
* **Undeath -** You resist 25% of incoming weapon damage, but healing spells have no effect.
**Supernatural Resistance -** Your Frost Resistance is increased by 100%, and your Poison and Disease Resistance are increased by 100%.
  
* **Weakness to Fire -** Your Fire Resistance is reduced by 100%.
**Weakness to Sunlight -** While exposed to sunlight, your Health, Magicka, and Stamina are reduced by 25, and your Health, Magicka, and Stamina Regeneration are reduced by 100%.
  

  
*Stage 4 Vampires have the following abilities:*
  
  

  
* **Undeath -** You resist 50% of incoming weapon damage, but healing spells deal damage to you.
**Supernatural Resistance -** Your Frost Resistance is increased by 100%, and your Poison and Disease Resistance are increased by 100%.
  
* **Weakness to Fire -** Your Fire Resistance is reduced by 100%.
**Weakness to Sunlight -** While exposed to sunlight, your Health, Magicka, and Stamina are reduced by 50, and your Health, Magicka, and Stamina Regeneration are reduced by 100%.
  

[/color]**Vampire Bloodlines**
  
Each of the game’s ten races reacts to Vampirism in a unique manner. These passives are designed with Aetherius in mind, but Aetherius is not required.
  
  
**SpoilerArgonian -** Your Poison spells cost 25% less Magicka, and you reduce the Poison Resistance of all nearby enemies by 25%.
  
  
**Breton -** Your Shock Resistance is increased by 50%, and your spells and enchantments cost 10% less.
  
  
**Dark Elf -** Your Vampiric spells cost 25% less, and you deal 25% extra damage with sneak attacks and spells.
  
  
**High Elf -** Your Magicka is increased by 50, and your Magicka Regeneration is increased by 50%.*\**
  
  
**Imperial -** Your Illusion spells last twice as long. 
  
  
**Khajiit -** Your Unarmed Damage is increased by 10, and your Movement Speed is increased by 10%.
  
  
**Nord -** Your Frost spells cost 25% less Magicka, and you reduce the Frost Resistance of all nearby enemies by 25%.
  
  
**Orc -** Your Health is increased by 50, and your Health Regeneration is increased by 50%.*\**
  
  
**Redguard -** Your Stamina is increased by 50, and your Stamina Regeneration is increased by 50%.*\**
  
  
**Wood Elf -** Your potions last 50% longer, and your poisons last for 50% more hits.
  
  
*\*When combined with Aetherius, this means that High Elves, Orcs, and Redguards can each regenerate one resource in the sunlight without any other bonuses.*
  
**Vampire Powers**
  
Vampires have access to a number of spells and powers. Generally speaking, Greater Powers are weighted towards Stage 1, so you must feed to maintain access to them. By contrast, Vampiric Drain grows stronger as you progress to Stage 4, allowing Stage 4 Vampires to heal without relying on potions or Restoration spells.
  
  
**Spoiler***All Vampires have the following abilities:*
  
  

  
* [color=#dd7e6b]**Vampiric Drain -** Absorb 5/10/15/20 Health per second from the target.
  
**Hunter’s Sight -** For 60 seconds, you have improved night vision and you can detect nearby creatures.
  
- **Vampire’s Seduction -** Surround yourself in a seductive aura for 60 seconds. Activating a target places them under your command for 1800 seconds.
  
*Stage 1 Vampires have the following ability:*
  
  

  
* **Champion of the Night -** Surround yourself with a cloud of vampire bats, draining 12 points of Health per second for 120 seconds.

  
*Stage 1 and 2 Vampires have the following ability:*
  
  

  
* **Embrace of Shadows -** Cloak yourself in shadows for 60 seconds. Attacking or activating an object will not break this effect.

  
*Stage 1, 2, and 3 Vampires have the following ability:*
  
  

  
* **Reign of Terror -** Manifest your vampiric presence, causing the living to flee for 60 seconds.

[/color]**Vampire Lord** 
  
  
In the Vanilla game, Vampire Lords gain extra Health, Magicka, Stamina, Armor Rating, and Unarmed Damage based on your PC's level. I have increased the scaling for each of these stats to ensure that Vampire Lords are competitive in the late game. In addition, I have added up to 25% Magic Resist to the level-based scaling mechanic. I have also increased the magnitude of the reanimation spell, significantly buffed the Drain Life spell, and removed a bizarre feature where the spell would be significantly weakened whenever Serana followed you into battle. Vampire Lords also have 100% Poison & Disease Resistance, 100% Frost Resistance, and 100% Weakness to Fire. 
  
  
**Spoiler***Scaling Breakpoints:*
  
  

  
* [color=#dd7e6b]**Level 10:** [cricket noises]
  
**Level 15:** +25 Health, Magicka, and Stamina, +50 Armor Rating, +10% Magic Resistance, +5 Unarmed Damage 
  
- **Level 20:** +50 Health, Magicka, and Stamina, +100 Armor Rating, +15% Magic Resistance, +10 Unarmed Damage

- **Level 50:** +200 Health, Magicka, and Stamina, +300 Armor Rating, +25% Magic Resistance, +40 Unarmed Damage
  
[/color]**Vampire Perks**
  
  
In addition to these general changes, I have also overhauled the Vampire Lord perk tree. Perks such as Nightwalker, Unearthly Will, and Devouring Claws focus on enhancing the combat potential of the Vampire Lord. Perks such as Underworld Lineage, Blood Sacrilege, and Night Power grant your Vampire Lord new spells and powers. Perks such as Ancient Thirst and Dread Harvest increase the power of your Absorb Health spells, whether you cast them as a Vampire Lord or not. Absorb Health spells added by Mysticism will benefit from these perks without a patch.
  
  
**SpoilerNightwalker (2/2):** You deal 25/50% extra damage as a Vampire Lord.
  
  
**Ancient Thirst (2/2):**Spells that absorb Health are 25/50% stronger.
  
**Dread Harvest (2/2):**Spells that absorb Health are 50/100% stronger against targets who fall below half Health.
  
**False Life (2/2):**Spells that absorb Health work on the undead/on the undead, Daedra, and automatons. 
  
  
**Potent Blood:** As a Vampire Lord, your Magicka Regeneration is increased by 100%.\*
  
**Power of the Grave:** As a Vampire Lord, your spells cost 25% less Magicka.
  
  
**Unearthly Will:** As a Vampire Lord, your Health and Magicka are increased by 100.
  
**Unnatural Strength:** As a Vampire Lord, your Armor Rating is increased by 100 and your Magic Resistance is increased by 25%.
  
**Devouring Claws:** As a Vampire Lord, claw attacks absorb Health. 
  
**Blood Scion:** When you enter combat as a Vampire Lord, you are surrounded with a cloud of bats that absorb Health from your enemies.
  
  
**Night Power:** As a Vampire Lord, you gain the Mist Form power. 
  
**Twilight’s Embrace:** As a Vampire Lord, you gain the Supernatural Reflexes power.
  
  
**Underworld Lineage (2/2):** As a Vampire Lord, you can cast the spells Frozen Wind and Lightning Flood /  Poison Bloom and Blood Price.
  
**Blood Sacrilege (2/2):** As a Vampire Lord, you can cast the spells Corpse Curse and Conjure Death Hound / Vampiric Grip and Conjure Gargoyle.
  
**Lamae’s Gift (2/2):** As a Vampire Lord, you can maintain one/two extra minions. 
  
  
*\* This perk allows you to regenerate Magicka in the sunlight as a Vampire Lord.*
  
**Vampire Artifacts**
  
Scion also covers four Vampire-themed artifacts, the Rings of Blood Magic and the Amulets of Night power. These artifacts work in both your "mortal" and your Vampire Lord form, and provide bonuses for specific Vampire spells and playstyles.
  
  
**SpoilerAmulet of Bats:** Your Vampiric spells cost 25% less. Vampire Lords also benefit from this effect.
  
  
**Amulet of the Gargoyle:** Your Gargoyle summons have 100 extra Armor Rating and 25% extra Magic Resistance. Vampire Lords also benefit from this effect.
  
  
**Ring of the Beast:** When you fall below half Health, you resist 25% of all incoming damage. Vampire Lords also benefit from this effect.
  
  
**Ring of the Erudite:** When you fall below half Magicka, you regenerate Magicka twice as fast. Vampire Lords also benefit from this effect.
  
**Installation**
  
  
Scion requires a new game, or a save where you have never become a Vampire. I will not offer **any**support for users who attempt to install this mod on a game where they already have Vampirism.
  
  
**Compatibility**
  
Scion is a streamlined Vampire overhaul that only touches records relevant to Vampires and Vampire Lords. Scion will be incompatible with any mod that that changes Vampires. However, it will not cause compatibility issues with any other mods. Furthermore, Scion does not touch any "race" records and will not cause any black face bugs.
