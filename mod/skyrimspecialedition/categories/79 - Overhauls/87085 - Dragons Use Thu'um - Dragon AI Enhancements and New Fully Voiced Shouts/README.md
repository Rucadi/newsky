**MOD ORIGINS**
  
Inspired by the amazing LE mod https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/12053
  
 Blacksupernova's amazing mod has been in my LE load order ever since I discovered it, and when I finally moved to SE It was not ported, and the mods that were somewhat similar to this were not quite my taste. So I decided to make my own from scratch, drawing inspiration from Blacksupernova's mod.
  
  
**WHAT DOES THIS MOD DO?**
  
  
"Now we will see whose Thu'um is the stronger!"

**MOD FEATURES**
  
  
With this mod every vanilla dragon, including DLC and Special ones like Alduin, Odahviing, Paarthurnax and Durnehviir will have their breath attacks overhauled. For instance instead of roaring when using fire breath, dragons will use the words of power YOL TOOR SHUL! Ironically these voice lines are inside the game sound files but Bethesda never properly utilized them. In addition to Fire and Frost Breath, Dragons will use Unrelenting Force, Disarm, Ice Form, Dismay, Phantom Form, Become Ethereal... and etc (ALL ARE FULLY VOICED) I have personally edited all the vanilla wav. files with Audacity, and turned them into FUZ, so that it remained very similar to the original mod, while still being different. With the latest 6.5 update, a single shout will have multiple shout sounds that will play randomly for more diversity! Also 6.5 gave Durnehviir his own unique shout sounds so he sounds a bit different to regular dragons now! Dragons will now use standing breath animations for some of their shouts! Big thanks to Dragon Animation Replacer Mod! Make sure to use Open Animation Replacer if you want those new animations! Furthermore, their AI and combat styles has been tweaked to have them use their shouts much more cleverly now! With the latest 8.0 Update dragons now have cooldowns on their shouts so they won't be spamming them over and over anymore!

**REGARDING THE MCM**The MCM gives you multiple menu options to pick and choose any shout you want for any dragon. The Maintenance Section is important to load your changes whenever you reload a save. Make sure to keep bLoadSettingsonReload=1 to achieve this. I divided every shout for every dragon via MCM so now you can individually pick which shouts which dragon will have. Do you want Alduin to only have 4 shouts while Paarthurnax have 6? You can do that. HOWEVER NEVER CHANGE THE MCM OPTION WHILE YOU ARE FIGHTING DRAGONS! ALSO DO NOT DISABLE ALDUIN'S STORMCALL, UNRELENTING FORCE, ICE FORM, AND DISMAY SHOUTS DURING THE OPENING SCENE AND DURING ALDUIN'S BANE QUEST, (where you read the Elder Scroll!) THOSE SHOUTS ARE ATTACHED TO CERTAIN PACKAGES SO THEY NEED TO BE ON OTHERWISE YOUR GAME MAY CRASH! YOU CAN TURN THEM OFF AFTERWARDS!!
  
  
**ANIMATION NOTES!**If you want to have special breath animations for Alduin (him standing on 2 legs), [GET THEM HERE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2163) then simply put ground\_exhalefirebreath.hkx and ground\_inhale.hkx files into the "Dragons Use Thu'um 8.0\Meshes\Actors\Dragon\Animations\OpenAnimationReplacer\DUT\DragonBase" folder to get animations for shouts.
  
  
**Compatibility:**
  
ALWAYS RUN MY MOD AFTER ANY DRAGON RELATED MOD UNLESS STATED OTHERWISE! This mod should be compatible with mods that do not edit the shouts dragons use. If they do edit them, the added shouts wont be voiced. Mods that edit dragon stats are fine, just let me know and I will make a patch for it.
  
**PS PLEASE READ:** While I am very happy to provide any patch requests please understand it is very very hard to handle more than 40+ patches and ensure proper consistency. My mod is ideally made for Deadly Dragons and I haven't thoroughly tested every single mod I am making the patches for. So they may not work as well and the more dragon mods you use the more things may get.
