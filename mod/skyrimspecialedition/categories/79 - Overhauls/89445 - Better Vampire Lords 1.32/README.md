This mod links with and requires Better Vampires 8.8 onward![](https://i.imgur.com/8CRe5Ju.png)

  
  
Better Vampire Lords includes 35 perks and its spells, skills, and abilities scale with you as you level up.
  
**Every original perk/spell/ability is enhanced and there are many new ones.**
  
With its MCM you can change settings and enable hotkeys.
  
As you grow in power, you will be able to invoke eclipses, fly, break open locks, and show your might as a Vampire Lord!

As a Vampire Lord, you can use a MCM setting to get access to some of the abilities you had as a regular vampire (as long as you could use them while in regular form). Vampire Lords will also be able to use: Sanguinem Reddere, Vampiric Mind Blast, Deflect Light and Shadows, Blink Attack, Frost Cloud, Blood Ward, Ice Flesh, Invoke Fog, Call Creature, Hemalurgic Spike, Flames of Coldharbour, Vampire's Seduction, and Domination.
  
  
While in Vampire Lord form, you will be able to loot, activate, and feed on thralls, sleeping victims, those you use Seduction on, bleeding out victims, and on dead bodies (if you have it enabled). Animations for feeding only exist in this form for seduction feeding and force feeding.  I have also decreased the height of the wireframe model slightly so the Vampire Lord can move through doorways easily.  I have an option to allow your Vampire Lord to fast travel as well; look in my MCM.
  
  
Unarmed damage and damage resistance are increased at lower levels and now scale up to level 100 (90-220 unarmed damage and 300-600 damage resistance).
  
  
  
**Drain Life – Spell**
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/aPNHLGg.jpg)
  
Damage a group of enemies (50-200 based upon your level), drain their health, and sap their stamina and magicka if Blood of the Ancients is active.  Those killed can add to perk points.
  
  
**Raise Dead – Spell**
  
![](https://i.imgur.com/UCzT4Bn.jpg)
  
Reanimate a more powerful dead body to fight for you for 30-150 seconds.

This lesser power has a toggled Night Eye effect. Regular night vision can be turned on/off while in Vampire Lord magic mode (levitating). However, if used in Vampire Lord melee mode, you can toggle on/off Vampiric Night Vision which is tinted red and highlights feeding victims.
  
  
**Bats – Lesser Power**
