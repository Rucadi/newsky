**Artificer -  An Artifact Overhaul**

  
Artificer is a complete overhaul of Skyrim's artifacts, designed to distribute Thaumaturgy and Mysticism enchantments throughout the game while ensuring that non-crafting characters can find powerful weapons and armor through questing. The mod is balanced around allowing top level artifacts to rival the power of even the best crafted items, allowing players to create competitive, high-level characters without investing in a crafting skill. In addition, Artificer also adds a modest number of artifacts to the game. Some of these new artifacts are items that existed in the Vanilla game (but were not treated as artifacts), while others are entirely new items. In addition, Artificer also adds several new enchantments to the game, which the player can only learn by disenchanting unique items.
  
  
 Artificer unlevels all artifacts and edits their stats to be more appropriate to their status. It also makes some edits to tempering recipes, and adds missing tempering recipes. These individual changes aren't generally listed due to the large amount of documentation bloat that would create.
  
  
Artificer also comes with an addon by Xavbio to provide unique textures to several artifacts, including some of its new and unique artifacts.
  
  
**Requirements**
  
  
Artificer requires [Thaumaturgy - An Enchanting Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57138) and [Mysticism - A Magic Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839?tab=description&BH=2), because it distributes weapon, armor, and staff enchantments from these mods to various artifacts in the game.
  
  
Scrambled Bugs is highly recommended, since it fixes a serious bug with complex weapon enchantments and allows certain shield enchantments to function alongside shield perks.

**Compatibility**
  
[/color]Artificer requires both Mysticism and Thaumaturgy, and thus inherits the compatibility profile of both mods. Artificer will require Scrambled Bugs for a couple of its shield enchantments to work with perks (and for some of its weapon enchantments to work well when enchanted by the player). In a few places, we have made edits to a quest, a cell, or an NPC in order to distribute new artifacts. We've attempted to keep these edits as un-invasive as possible. 
  
  
Artificer is not compatible with other Artifact mods, and is likely not compatible with some enchanting mods due to requiring Thaumaturgy. [color=#8e7cc3]
