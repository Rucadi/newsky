[font=bebas\_neuebook]Life as a Vampire[/font]
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]The curse of Molag Bal[/font]
  
  
**Vampirism is not a blessing.** Ancient vampires may be powerful and feared among the populace, but they start their unlife in a weakened state and must overcome hardships to attain the power they seek.
  
  
Molag Bal's presence gnawing at the sanity of every vampire is known as "the Beast", a primal force that possesses weakened vampires and drives them to ruin. It is important to stay well fed and healthy to avoid its temptations, lest you find yourself unable to heal or getting attacked by a mob of townsfolk.
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Vampiric thirst and feeding[/font]
  
  
As a vampire, you must feed. Each day that goes by without feeding makes you thirstier and weaker. There are four stages of thirst and you progress to the next stage after at least 24 hours without feeding, though occasionally you may be able to delay the onset of thirst by a few hours. The **Vampire** ability in your magic effects menu tells you how thirsty you are.
  
  

* **Sated**[/\*]
**Thirsty**[/\*]
  
* **Parched**[/\*]
**Blood Starved** (At this point, your vampirism is so obvious that onlookers will attack you on sight.)[/\*]
  

  
Feeding immediately returns you to Sated status no matter how thirsty you were before. To feed, activate a sleeping person or a person affected by the **Vampire's Seduction** power and choose "Feed". You may also choose to "Drain" a sleeping person, killing them instantly as you feed. Perks and abilities offer additional ways to feed, including sneak feeding, combat feeding, etc.
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Abilities[/font]
  
  
Vampires receive the following beneficial and detrimental abilities:
  
  

  
* **Dominate:** Illusion spells cast by a vampire are **10**% more powerful and last **15**% longer on creatures and people.[/\*]
**Moonlit Waters:** A vampire can swim underwater without drowning.[/\*]
  
* **Resist Disease:** Your Vampiric blood gives you **100**% resistance to disease.[/\*]
**Resist Frost:** Your Vampiric blood gives you **50 (Sated) to 20 (Blood Starved)**% resistance to Frost.[/\*]
  
* **Resist Poison:** Your Vampiric blood gives you **100**% resistance to poison.[/\*]
**Still Heart:** A vampire is **10**% harder to detect by creatures and people while sneaking.[/\*]
  
* **Trespassing Curse:** When trespassing in someone else's home, lose **10** points of Magicka and Stamina per second.[/\*]
**Weakness to Fire:** Your Vampiric blood gives you **20 (Sated) to 50 (Blood Starved)**% weakness to Fire.[/\*]
  
* **Weakness to Sunlight:** Health, Magicka, and Stamina do not recover while in Sunlight and are reduced by **25 (Sated) to 100 (Blood Starved)** points.[/\*]

  
Vampires also receive the following abilities depending on thirst. As you become thirstier, you lose beneficial abilities and gain detrimental abilities instead, representing Molag Bal's growing influence over you.
  
  

  
* **Fortitude:** Vampiric blood makes you hard to kill. Upon taking fatal damage, you come back to life, becoming thirstier.[/\*]
    
  *...when Thirsty, turns into...*
**Wassail:** The Beast awakens below **25**% Health in combat, draining Health, Magicka and Stamina during combat and reducing them by **10** points until you feed.[/\*]
  

  

  
* **Kiss of Death:** Draining a victim (killing them by feeding) permanently increases Health, Magicka and Stamina by **1**.[/\*]
    
  *...when Parched, turns into...*
**The Beast:** Unable to Feed and can only Drain mortal victims, which kills them. (Immortal targets can't be drained.)[/\*]
  

  

  
* **Presence:** Your Vampiric charm makes intimidation attempts twice as likely to succeed, and buying items is **5**% cheaper.[/\*]
    
  *...when Blood Starved, turns into...*
**Mockery of Life:** Healing spells and effects no longer heal you. Potions of Blood have no effect. You don't regenerate Health.[/\*]
  

  
Each race has one additional racial vampire ability.
  
  

  
* **Altmer - Wine and Revelry:** Feeding increases Magicka by **50** points for **60** seconds (**600** seconds if the victim is sleeping).[/\*]
**Argonian - Jeweled Scales:** Protected against Sunlight while swimming and for **180** seconds after leaving the water.[/\*]
  
* **Bosmer - Bitter Sap:** **100**% weakness to poison. Consumed alchemy ingredients are reversed and **10** times stronger.[/\*]
**Breton - Dolmen Haunt:** Can feed by activating a Standing Stone.[/\*]
  
* **Dunmer - Tainted Blood:** Feeding on people grants you their racial vampire ability. You can only have one at a time.[/\*]
**Imperial - Cult of Shadows:** Shrine blessings also increase Magicka and Stamina by **25** points, but their effects are reversed.[/\*]
  
* **Khajiit - Misfortune:** You bring bad luck. In combat, your enemies within **50** feet have **5**% chance per second to trip and fall.[/\*]
**Nord - From Ancient Soil:** Once per battle, you may activate a corpse to reanimate it. The corpse crumbles to dust when combat ends.[/\*]
  
* **Orc - Lavish Brutality:** Feeding increases Stamina by **50** points for **60** seconds (**600** seconds if the victim is sleeping).[/\*]
**Redguard - Ruler of Locusts:** Once per battle, activate an enemy humanoid to send insects that deal **5** poison damage for **60** seconds.[/\*]

Vampires receive the following spells and powers.

All spells and powers belong to their respective spell school (Illusion for Vampire's Command, Restoration for Blood Cauldron, Conjuration for Nightwalk, etc.) and are affected by relevant perks.
  
  
Vampires deal **20**% more damage with frost spells and effects and **20**% less damage with fire spells and effects. This can be disabled in the MCM.
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Vampire ranks[/font]
  
  
A fledgling vampire is a pathetic sight, while an elder nightmaster vampire is feared and respected. Progress to the next rank is based on time spent as a vampire, but you can also feed on a victim to age by one hour or drain a victim to age by one day. The **Vampire** ability in your magic effects menu displays your progress.
  
  
An MCM option is available to change the rate at which you progress to the next rank.
  
  

* **Fledgling:** This is how you start your vampiric existence.[/\*]
**Blooded:** 5 days.[/\*]
  
* **Mistwalker:** 15 days.[/\*]
**Nightstalker:** 30 days.[/\*]
  
* **Nightlord:** 50 days.[/\*]
**Nightmaster:** 75 days.[/\*]
  
* Etc...[/\*]

  
Upon advancing to the next rank, you may choose an additional ability or power from a list of 13, including a variety of roleplaying and powergamer options.
  
  

* **Blood Bond:** Feeding on a sleeping victim makes them a lover, potential follower and marriage partner.[/\*]

**Harvest Moon:** Draining a victim also generates a Potion of Blood.[/\*]

[font=bebas\_neuebook]Feeding on powerful individuals ("Blue Blood")[/font]
  
  
Where is the fun in preying on the weak? Feeding on some of the strongest individuals in Skyrim (Ulfric, Elenwen, etc.) grants up to 7 additional abilities. After your first feeding, you receive the Blue Blood quest, marking all targets with strong blood on the map. Abilities are unlocked in a fixed order as follows.
  
  

  
* **Potence:** Vampiric strength grants **15**% more attack damage, increased to **30**% when **Sated**.[/\*]
**Sense Vitae:** Activate a living target while sneaking to learn its attributes and resistances.[/\*]

**Tooth and Claw:** Your attacks deal **25**% more damage to targets affected by a Hemomancy spell such as **Blood Seed**.[/\*]
  
* **Mytherceria:** Protected by the cloak of night one hour earlier in the evening and one hour later in the morning.[/\*]
**Masquerade:** You are no longer hated and feared when **Blood Starved**.[/\*]
  
* **Daywalker:** You are immune to non-lethal Sunlight.[/\*]

  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Hemomancy[/font]
  
  
Draining a sleeping victim may teach you arcane secrets of the blood, in the form of 7 Hemomancy spells. The first spell requires 1 draining, increasing by 1 for each consecutive secret. Hemomancy spells are classified as Destruction and deal magic damage to living and undead targets.

[font=bebas\_neuebook]Conflict[/font]
  
  
The 6.x update will add more vampire hunter factions.
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Life as a Vampire Lord[/font]
  
  
Vampire Lord gameplay has been significantly upgraded in both melee and magic form. To promote interactivity, Vampire Lords do not regenerate Magicka in magic form or Stamina in melee form, encouraging them to switch often, and new perks increase the power level and variety of both forms. In general, the Vampire Lord excels at dealing with large numbers of enemies, starting out with an area effect spell and having access to several perks to further improve their ability to dispatch crowds, including spells to pull them together and stun them while dealing cleave damage.
  
  
Additionally, Vampire Lords can now loot bodies, use objects and gain Destruction experience. However, everyone who is not a Volkihar vampire will attack you as an enemy.
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Abilities[/font]
  
  
Vampire Lords receive the following abilities:
  
  

  
* **Royal Bloodline:** Vampire Lords gain **25 (level 5) to 250 (level 50)** points of Health, Magicka and Stamina, **0 (level 5) to 45 (level 50)** points of attack damage and **75 (level 5) to 300 (level 50)** points of armor.[/\*]
**Fall From Grace:** Vampire Lords are immune to fall damage.[/\*]
  
* **Stagger Attack:** Attacks in melee form stagger most targets.[/\*]
**Weakness to Sunlight:** Health, Magicka, and Stamina do not recover while in Sunlight and are reduced by **100** points.[/\*]
  

  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Spells and powers[/font]
  
  
Vampire Lords receive the following spells and powers.
  
  

  
* **Raze:** *Spell -* Cast a wave of blood that cuts through targets in a line, absorbing **15 (level 5) to 25 (level 50)** Health and dealing **50 (level 5) to 150 (level 50)** additional magic damage.[/\*]
**Lord's Servant:** *Spell -* Reanimate a level **25 (level 5) to 50 (level 50)** corpse for **60** seconds.[/\*]
  
* **Bats:** *At will -* Dash in your direction of movement. (**2** charges)[/\*]

  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Perks[/font]
  
  
The Vampire Lord perk tree is expanded from 11 to 31 perks, but new ways of gaining Vampire Lord perk points exist. Many perks affect your mortal form as well, allowing you to scale even when not in Vampire Lord form. Perks are easier to attain: each perk point you gain only increases the required number of kills to the next perk point by 1 instead of 2. (This is not retroactive if you are already a Vampire Lord upon installing Sacrosanct. Sorry.)
  
  

  
* **Power is Power:** All attributes (Health, Magicka, Stamina) are increased by **50** points as Vampire Lord. Choose an attribute to further increase by **100** points.[/\*]
**Wings of the Strix:** In magic mode, sprinting allows you to glide, greatly reducing fall speed.[/\*]
  
* **Astral Poison:** Attacks in melee form deliver an unnatural toxin, dealing **25** points of poison damage and absorbing **50** points of Magicka over **5** seconds.[/\*]
**Night Cloak:** In combat, you are surrounded by a cloud of bats that feed on living enemies within melee range, absorbing **5** points of Health per second from each.[/\*]

**Mist Form:** Night Power: Morph into a dark mist for **15** seconds, becoming undetectable and invulnerable but unable to fight while regenerating **25** points of Health, Magicka and Stamina per second. (Magicka cost: **50**, cooldown: **30** seconds)[/\*]
  
* **The Reaping:** Night Power: Unleash your inner Beast, slowing time while gaining **40**% movement speed and **60**% attack speed and launching enemies with your power attacks. Lasts for **10** seconds. (Magicka cost: **75**, cooldown: **40** seconds)[/\*]

* **Fountain of Youth:** Killing a person with a power attack bite in melee form restores all your Health and **150** Magicka.[/\*]

My "full size" overhauls can be used interchangeably with my "V++" overhauls, which are more vanilla-plus and stay closer to vanilla Skyrim balancing, at the cost of some of the more crazy features. See [my profile page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3959191) for a full list.
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Compatibility[/font]
  
  
See [here](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/articles/54/?) for a list of (in)compatible mods.
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]Installation[/font]
  
  
**Installation procedure:** Add the mod to your load order and activate it. Note that existing abilities that are active on your character cannot be modified, which may result in some abilities being incorrect or "stuck on your character". Ideally, you want to install the mod before you contract vampirism to avoid this issue, but this is not strictly necessary and the mod will be functional even if you don't.
  
  
If you encounter this issue, open the console and type *player.setrace [Your]Race* (for instance *HighElfRace*). Then leave the console for a few seconds and type *player.setrace [Your]RaceVampire*. This will fix most issues.
  
  
**Uninstallation procedure:** Just remove the mod, ideally when you are not a vampire.
  
  
**To upgrade from versions before 5.00 to 5.00 or later:** Ideally, you should not be a vampire. If you must, make sure you are Sated, then feed after upgrading.
  
  
[font=bebas\_neuebook]FAQ
  
[/font]
  

  
* **I receive an error message stating that some scripts have been modified by another mod:** You have either a mod loaded below Sacrosanct that modifies PlayerVampireQuestScript and/or DLC1PlayerVampireChangeScript; a local copy of those scripts in your data\scripts folder (possibly left behind by a mod); or an outdated compatibility patch. **Better Vampires:** If you are using Better Vampires and its Sacrosanct compatibility patch, this message is expected because Better Vampires removes most mortal form features from Sacrosanct and replaces them with its own, so the error is correctly telling you that Sacrosanct content has been replaced. It can be ignored, unless you want those features, of course.[/\*]
**Unable to Feed on specific named actors:** When Parched or Blood Starved, you have the detrimental ability The Beast, which replaces the Feed option with the (lethal) Drain option, forcing you to kill the victim of your feeding. However, you can't Drain essential actors (= unkillable for quest purposes). Find some nobody who won't be missed and Drain them instead. (Version 3.00 and later allow you to feed on moth priest Dexion in particular regardless of your thirst stage. Version 5.00 and later allow you to Drain regardless and give a descriptive failure message to reduce confusion.)[/\*]
  
* **I don't have the Blue Blood quest or various other mortal form features:** If you are using Better Vampires and its Sacrosanct compatibility patch, it replaces Sacrosanct's mortal form progression with its own and just gives you all the spells and powers at once, resulting in the loss of many abilities, the Blue Blood questline, and breaking several perks.[/\*]
**I just died for no reason!** Weakness to Sunlight reduces Health by up to 100 points when Blood Starved, killing you if you never put any points into Health. Alternatively, Wassail applies a stacking 10 point penalty to all attributes, potentially reducing Health to zero. Alternatively, due to a quirk with the Vampire Lord, its Weakness to Sunlight will activate before the Health bonus from Royal Bloodline upon transforming, killing players with 100 or less Health.[/\*]
  
* **When I gain The Beast, the Drain option is missing:** You can't Drain essential actors (= unkillable for quest purposes). In versions before 5.00, the Drain option was removed for those actors, causing some confusion. 5.00 allows you to Drain regardless but displays a message indicating that the target is invalid. Alternatively, if you are using version 4.00, there was a bug in this version that has been fixed in 4.01 and later. Alternatively, you can't Drain actors that are essential (= unkillable for quest purposes) and the option to Drain is absent in versions before 5.00. Alternatively, if you are using Better Vampires and its Sacrosanct compatibility patch, it replaces Sacrosanct feeding with Better Vampires feeding, which does not have a Drain option.[/\*]
**Perk descriptions are truncated on 4:3 aspect ratio monitors:** This is a limitation of Skyrim. Use the [Extended UI](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/57873/?) mod.[/\*]
  
* **My abilities, perks or powers are wrong or not as advertised:** You have another mod loaded below Sacrosanct that modifies this content. Load it above Sacrosanct. Alternatively, this can be caused by applying this mod to an existing savegame: see above under "Installation". Alternatively, some mods will add their own vampire related features, overriding Sacrosanct. See the "Compatibility notes".[/\*]
