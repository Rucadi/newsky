# Relationship Dialogue Overhaul Lite

A cut, and slimmed down version of RDO that removes some of the feature creep/bloat.
  
  
  
-Use this mod on a new game, do not replace your RDO full on your current saved game.
  
  
-The cutting room and USSEP patch are no longer needed and should not be used with this; just load CRF after RDO!
  
  
-The AI Overhaul patch is still required and works fine.
  
  
  
  
*Here's what was removed, as detailed as possible:*
  
  
**ARMOR** -  Three single records, one of which was for an added follower.
  
  
**BOOK** -  One spell tome (Fade Other), and the RDO Bard Edda Verse.
  
  
**CELL** -  Placed NPCs/objects, holding cells.
  
  
**CLASS**-  For the added followers.
  
  
**COBS** -  RDO Scaled Armor (removed up top in ARMOR)
  
  
**CONTAINER**-  RDO holding cell container (removed in CELL)
  
  
**COMBAT STYLE** -  For the added followers.
  
  
**DIALOGUE TOPIC** -  This is trickier to go through in briefness; most of what was removed were single records that pertained to the added followers, and an added bandit NPC.
  
  
**DIALOGUE BRANCH** -  Same thing here; most of what was removed had to do with those added followers/NPCs/objects.
  
  
**OBJ EFFECT**-  This was two records for the added armor.
  
  
**FORM ID LIST** -  I removed the 'aaa\_RDOPreventedActorsList' in version 1.1; not sure what this is, but it's very empty, no list of formids underneath it.  Previously removed: \_RDOEncOrcHuntersFemale, \_RDOMPxExcludedActors, \_RDOWEAdventurerBrawlerSubChar, a\_CustomSpellList (this one looked fishy to me), \_RDOEncHunters
  
  
**LEVELED NPC** -  One record:  \_RDOWERoadNobleSubChar
  
  
**MAGIC EFFECT** -  This was a big one.  Reported crashes were stemming from magic battles with RDO installed; there were some very odd, single records that affected VANILLA magic effects in here, so shouldn't that all be green looking?  I would say so; when I tweak magic effects in Skyrim, I do a copy as override.  Why on Earth would we need more than one magic effect that affects the same spells?  Jury's out on that one, but CTD was being reported; now those effects are gone.  Oh, and the invisibility eye mesh fix, which is now redundant with the eye fixing mods that we all have access to in 2019.
  
  
**MISC ITEM** -  One record:  a\_RDOFFGrelkaSatchel
  
  
**NPC** -  EVERYTHING, for obvious reasons.
  
  
**OUTFIT**-  Two follower outfits.
  
  
**PACKAGE** -  Another lengthy one; only single records regarding RDO's added followers and NPCs, including Terik, were removed.  Vanilla records were left intact.
  
  
**PERK** -  One perk:  a\_RDODualFlurry, whoever that was for.
  
  
**QUEST** -  Same thing as Package, lots regarding added followers/NPCs, including Terik, and its quests (the Grelka thing/Bard Edda?). Vanilla left intact.
  
  
**RELATIONSHIP** -  Again, added followers.
  
  
**SCENE** -  Two records:  One for Kaie, another for Terik.
  
  
**STORY QST NODE** -  One record:  a\_RDOKaieConfrontQuestNode
  
  
**SPELL** -  See MAGIC EFFECT.
  
  
**WEAPON** -  Kaie's Sword of Leeching/Harvesting (obviously explains the dual flurry perk.)
  
  
All scripts that looked vanilla affecting and important for functionality are included, but scripts pertaining to added magic effects, quests, followers, etc were removed.
