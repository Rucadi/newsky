Change dragon priests to humanoid so that they can fight at their full potential now. 
  
Vanilla dragon priests tend to have AI and behavior problems, like stuck there and do nothing or get hit for half of health before they actually start to fight. While humanoid dragon priests no longer have these problems. Enjoy a true epic battle with them.
  
Humanoid means they use human skeleton and behave like human enemies like mages. Cult made 116 unique animations for them to distinguish them from regular mages.
