**Requiem - Knockdown tweak**
  
  
Enhance the Knockdown system in Requiem. In vanilla Requiem, enemies' Knockdown abilities cannot be effectively resisted and are highly inconsistent. Random roadside Sabrecats can lock down your character with Knockdown abilities, against which you have no defense. Giant Dwemer centurions, on the other hand, fail to tip your balance even slightly.
  
With Requiem - Knockdown installed, enemies' Knockdown abilities can be blocked, allowing for a more balanced gameplay experience. Additionally, most giant enemies will possess Knockdown abilities, making them more consistent.
  
  
-The creatures have the knockdown ability : Dragon, Giant, Dwemer centurion, Frost atronach, Bear, Sabrecat, Troll, Giant spider, Lurker. 
  
-With the level 100 perk in block, you can hold your ground against the unrelenting force shout by blocking.
  
-Astrid's paralyzing attack can be defended by blocking, warding, or the enchantment stamina II.
  
-The paralyzing attack from the perk "stunning precision" can be defended by blocking with a shield, warding, or the stamina II enchantment.

**Requiem - general NPC tweaks** 
  
  
(The previous Requiem - NPC Statefix)
  
  
Some npc in requiem didn't have proper perks and equipment. This mod aim to make some specific NPCs be more consistent with their story. For example, The Vaermina's acolytes said they were overwhelmed by the orcish invaders, but what you see in requiem is that the acolytes slaughter all the invaders; Redeagle is capable of killing a thousand imperial soldiers in the skyrim lore, while he is only a normal draugr boss who can barely kill ten soldiers.
  
It isn't a pure fix mod, but it adds some feature I want. A few custom enchanted stuffs for example .
  
  
**Highly recommend [this](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51608) mod to fix dragonpriests behaviour**

**Requiem - VampireCollection**
  
  
The mid-end game in Requiem always lacks proper enemies to fight. While vampires are ideal threat as mid-end game content, they are not well tweaked by Requiem as Bandits. This mod aims to create more NPC vampire variations, makes them more balanced, and overhaul the vampires relates to Dawnguard quest line. With this mod, you'll find them like high level adventurer like you. It is an NPC vampire mod, so you can use this mod with other player vampire mods.
  
  
**Significant changes**:
  
1. Add a lot of NPC vampire variations. More vampire races (ie: Khajit vampire), More vampire classes (ie: vampire with sword and shield).
  
2. To solve the problem that the dawnguard quest line being boring, its difficulty becomes more smooth. It will start easier, but end harder. Also there will no longer has ebony vampire shows up in the first quest of Dawnguard, so player can start the dawnguard first before being a demi-god. (For those who never played Requiem, ebony vampires are one of the hardest enemy in the game.)
  
3. The chance of spawning an ebony vampire is reduced to 10% (from 25% in Requiem)
  
4. Enchantment "Fortify health II" reduces vampire/gargoyle drain by 75% (from 100% in Requiem)
  
5. Special vampire bosses (ie: Harkon) are way harder than before. They have proper power now.

**Requiem - Alduin redone**The design of Alduin is kind of strange in Requiem. Even as king of dragons, his strength isn't stronger than other dragons in Requiem, but Requiem gives him very powerful summoning ability instead. The summoning ability doesn't make sense, nor creates fun fight for some builds, and that is the reason why I want to make this mod. This mod aims to make Alduin like a true king of dragons, and also make the battle less tedious but still keep the difficulty.
  
  
**Significant changes**:
  
-Alduin will not summon the undeads from soul cairn anymore. Instead, he will summon his ally and cultists.
  
-The summoning ability is given a proper CD time, which makes defensive builds have chance against him. Eliminating his minions is viable for most build.
  
-Alduin's shouts are more powerful than other dragons, and his shouts are unique to the others.

**Requiem - Better Forgotten Vale**
  
If you've finished the Dawnguard questline once in Requiem, you may find that the forgotten vale content is really underwhelm. Especially this location is placed after soulcairn, so all you get in this map are good views and boredoms. This mod will provide you better adventure feeling in forgotten vale, and some epic battles will happen there. Even so, to keep it lore-friendly, forgotten vale is still not a hyper end game area like soulcairn. No super daedra like slighted. No powerful undead like mistmen.
  
  
Highly recommend playing this mod with NPC\_statefix and VampireCollection in the same page for full experience. The two mods provide some enemy NPC records which can be used in this mod.
  
  
Note 1: Because I put a lot of NPCs in a certain area, you will have performance drop. It's about 10~20 fps in my test.
  
Note 2: This mod is designed to make forgotten vale harder. I add a lot of enemies there, so you only install this mod if you want some spicy stuff at the end of dawnguard questline.
