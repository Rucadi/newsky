# Bottled Lanterns LP
- Author: Bottle
- Game: skyrimspecialedition
- Mod Page: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/139376


This is just an all in one of my old exterior lantern mods. Bulbs have been removed and all plugins packed into a fomod for modularity. This is intended for use with Light placer.
  
  
Compatibility:
  

  
* Lux Orbis, Partly but the Street lights plugin in this mod will likely conflict
Lanterns of Skyrim II, not compatible
  
* Town overhauls, most will be fine again its most likely the Streetlights plugin that will conflict.
Placed Light, if you use this mod do not select the exterior addon from Placed Light. This is a modular version of that exterior addon in Placed Light.
  

  
Suggestions:
  
You will need a set of Light Placer configs for the objects to cast light
  

  
* [CS Light](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/138443)﻿
[LPO](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/136870)﻿
  
Use one of these. Please read the linked mod pages for more info if needed.
