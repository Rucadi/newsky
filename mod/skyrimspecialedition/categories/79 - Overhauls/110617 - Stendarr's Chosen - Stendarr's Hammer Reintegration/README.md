**Stendarr's Chosen**
  
**Stendarr's Hammer Reintegrated**

  
  
Of all of the Creation Club content, the placement of Stendarr's Hammer has always been the most bothersome for me. Placing it in a museum for dwarven artifacts seems particularly odd for an Aedric artifact. This mod seeks to reimplement the creation in a more immersive way by having it require divine intervention of some sort to acquire it.
  
  
**What does this mod do?**
  
  

  
* The original spawn point in Calcelmo's museum has been disabled.
The original quest is already disabled following the Anniversary Edition update, so no changes were necessary, but just in case the wording within the quest has been adjusted to suit this mod's version of finding the hammer.
  
* Requires being **level 15** or higher to allow the mod to do its startup, which will then occur the **next time you enter a settlement, town or city**.
Once started, the mod chooses **one impact site** from the list (which can be expanded via addons).
  
* When the player first approaches the chosen impact site after setup, Stendarr's Hammer will fall to the ground and create an impact crater (see video below for an example)
Stendarr's Hammer can now be interacted with, but keep in mind that you will need to find a way to be deemed worthy by Stendarr to pick it up.

**Patches**This mod contains patchless compatibility for relevant items and effects from a few mods that might aid in lifting the hammer.
  
  
**Bruma Addon** - Adds two new possible fall locations located within County Bruma.
  
  
**Wyrmstooth Addon** - Adds two new possible fall locations on Wyrmstooth.
  
  
**No Skyrim Spawns** - removes all sites from the possible site list located within the Skyrim worldspace. I often find myself feeling that Skyrim is oversaturated with artifacts and see this as a way to nudge some elsewhere.**Compatibility**
  
  
Does not need a new game. Stendarr's Hammer in Calcelmo's Museum gets disabled as expected even if already loaded. This mod assumes you have not picked the Hammer up before it is installed and will likely let you get a second copy if you have.
  
  
Has some patchless integration for things that might help you pick up the hammer.
  
  
A lot of the places that were chosen are far away from a lot of things, however, there is always a possibility of conflict with things that modify the world. I haven't needed any patches for my load order, but people are welcome to release patches if they find any such problems, either by moving the location or removing it from the formlist.
  
  
This mod does not touch the weapon itself, so any rebalancing mods will function alongside this mod.
