Dragon Priests are some of my favorite enemies to fight in Skyrim, but unfortunately, they become laughably easy encounters at higher levels. Even the mighty masked priests fall with little effort against a high-level character...
  
  
*No more!*I've taken it upon myself to improve Dragon Priests in a manner that expands upon the vanilla system and makes it more interesting and engaging. This mod is balanced around Simonrim, the series of gameplay overhaul mods that I personally use. I'm sure that my level of balancing will still be easily dispatched with the insane power you can get with Enairim, given I can't really balance around the crazy stuff you can do with that setup.
  
  
Generally, you'll want to have some decent resistances and good damage output in order to deal with Dragon Priests. More powerful priests typically have quests associated with them, and will be formidable foes to take down. These aren't encounters designed for you to take on at super low levels (unless you're a masochist or just very, very good at the game in general), but will provide a fair and engaging challenge as long as you're prepared, even into the late-game.
  
  
  
With that out of the way, let's get onto the stats!

Spoiler**I personally recommend these mods to enhance the experience:****[Dragon Priest Fix - Behavior Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51608) - Unlocks dual-casting, allows for casting two different spells in each hand at the same time
  
  
[The Dragon Cult - A Draugr Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/81422) - Overhauls Draugr in a Simonrim fashion. Plays well with King-Priest!

Spoiler**"When casting spells at Dragon Priests, sometimes a message pops up saying that they resisted it!"
  
This seems to be how enemies having spell absorption works, since the damage is negated. As far as I can tell, there isn't really a way to fix this, but it's a nice indicator that your spell was absorbed.**
