**Adamant - A Perk Overhaul**
  
Adamant is a complete overhaul of Skyrim’s perk trees designed to balance existing skills and add powerful new perks to the game. It thoroughly overhauls the game’s skill trees in order to provide the player with compelling choices and smooth progression from start to finish. While Adamant does increase the total number of perks in the game by a small amount, it avoids bloat, sprawl, and power creep by balancing its selection of perks around Vanilla perk gains. Like many modern perk overhauls, it provides support for popular gameplay styles that are underutilized in the Vanilla game, such as shouts, staves, and unarmed combat.
  
  
In order to build off my previous work, Adamant requires [Mysticism - A Magic Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839?tab=description&BH=2) to be installed. This allows me to introduce new perks to support spells such as Viperbolt, Reflective Light, and Silence in the most straightforward way possible.
  
  
Adamant can be expanded with the optional [Hand to Hand - An Adamant Addon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59790) that merges Lockpicking and Pickpocket into a single tree, Security, and then adds a standalone Hand to Hand tree. This addon requires **[Address Library for SKSE Plugins](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444)**and is compatible with pre-AE and post-AE versions of Skyrim.﻿

* *Leveling Restoration decreases the cost of Restoration spells by up to 50%.*
*Repose affects spells such as Regeneration, Healing Light, Attunement, Turn Undead, Poison Cloak, and Stendarr’s Aura. It does not affect the duration of spells like Poison Cloud and Viperbolt.*
  
* *Ward perks allow wards to protect against both physical and magical damage. Wards are competitive with shields on dedicated builds.*
*Plague reduces the Poison Resistance of all nearby enemies by 25/50%. If the enemy has very high Poison Resistance, Plague automatically doubles in strength. This allows poison mages to remain competitive without overtaking Destruction mages.*
  
* *For the purposes of Plague, Weakness to Poison counts as a poison spell. Additionally, having an active Poison Cloak also triggers the perk.*
*Pilgrim adds a religion mechanic to Adamant, and gives Restoration mages access to a wide array of interesting buffs.*
  
**Smithing**
  
  
*Smithing is the art of forging weapons and armor from raw materials.*

***Notes***
  
  

  
* *Sneak attacks are stronger in power than in Vanilla, but require more perk investments.*
*Silent Casting is now a Sneak perk, to support characters who wish to use Shadow Casting without investing in Illusion.*
  
* *Daggers have increased sneak attack damage from the beginning of the game (to fix the Vanilla problem where Maces are the best stealth weapon until the player takes several perks).*

***Notes***
  
  

  
* *Supply and Demand and Investor now significantly increase the gold reserves of merchants, to encourage players to engage with Speech perks instead of simply waiting for the merchants to reset their inventories.*
*You will fail almost all Speech checks without the Persuasion perk. With the Persuasion perk, you will succeed at almost all Speech checks.*
  
* *Due to the way the game handles Shout cooldown, it is relatively easy to reach 0% cooldown when using mods from multiple different authors. I recommend that players exercise discretion when combining Stormcrown with other bonuses. I have balanced Shout perks around a maximum cooldown reduction of 75%. In addition, I have provided a plugin that alters the bonus of the Talos Shrine in order to mitigate this concern.*
*Shouting in combat gives Speech experience.*
  
**Two-handed** 
  
  
*The Two-handed skill governs the use of larger weapons such as greatswords, battleaxes, and warhammers.*

***Notes***

**Adamant - Bard Perks Addon**
  
  
Adamant comes with an optional Bard Perks Addon that introduces a small music mechanic and replaces the Shout perks in the Speech tree with a set of Bard-themed perks. This addon requires SKSE and SPID.
  
**﻿Bard Perks** 
  
  
The Adamant - Bard Perks Addon makes several changes to the Speech tree. All Shout perks have been removed; Shouting no longer grants Speech XP; the second rank of Supply and Demand is now a level 70 perk; and Investor is now a level 90 perk. In addition, five new perks have been added to the Speech tree.
  
  
Spoiler**Bard (30/60):** Your bard songs are twice as strong / and grant an additional bonus to you and your allies.
  
**Troubadour (40):** Your bard songs last three times as long and affect your summoned or reanimated minions.
  
**Skald (80):**Your bard songs are twice as strong on your allies.
  
**Bard Songs**
  
  
With the Adamant - Bard Perks Addon installed, whenever you have an instrument in your inventory, you will receive a power that will allow you to play the ﻿instrument for a small buff. You can only have one buff at a time; however, if you have multiple instruments in your inventory, you will be able to switch between buffs situationally. Playing an instrument will also grant Speech XP based on the number of nearby allies or NPCs. All of these buffs affect both you and all nearby allies.
  
  
Spoiler**Play Drum:** Your Health is increased by 25/50 for 10 minutes. / You resist 10% of all incoming damage.
  
**Play Flute:** Your Magicka is increased by 25/50 for 10 minutes / Your spells cost 10% less Magicka.
  
**Play Lute:** Your Stamina is increased by 25/50 for 10 minutes. / Your Movement is increased 10%.
  
**﻿Pilgrim Integration**
  
  
﻿The Adamant - Bard Perks Addon also comes with an optional Pilgrim patch that turns Jephre into a Bard god who gives different bonuses based on your ﻿bard song. These bonuses only apply to the player, not to the player’s allies. 
  
  
Spoiler**Play Drum:** You resist 25% of all incoming damage when you fall below half Health.
  
**Play Flute:** You move 20% faster while casting a spell
  
**Play Lute:** You spend 20% less Stamina while power attacking or drawing a bow.
  
**﻿Other Changes**
  
  
﻿The Adamant - Bard Perks Addon also normalizes the weight of instruments, increases their value, and adds instruments to the vendor inventories of the General Store merchants in Solitude, Markarth, Whiterun, Windhelm, and Riften. You may need to run a bashed patch or otherwise patch these five ﻿merchant chests. In addition, completing the instrument quests in the Bard’s College will double the duration of your bard songs for the corresponding ﻿instrument.
  
  
﻿As a final note, there are several (Vanilla) locations where you can acquire an instrument in the early game, without stealing. Those locations are: 
  
  
Spoiler**Valtheim Towers -** Drum
  
**Halted Stream Camp -** Flute
  
**White River Watch -** Lute
  
**Adamant - Smithing Addon**
  
  
The Vanilla tempering system frontloads the tempering system's power, causing the player to deal too much damage with too little investment into Smithing. Unfortunately, due to a combination of engine limitations and the constraints of my project, Adamant makes this issue a little worse than Vanilla. To address this, I've added an optional plugin that uses [Improvement Names Customized AE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59435)﻿ (or [Improvement Names Customized SSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27776)) to split the Vanilla tempering system from six﻿ tiers into ten. These tiers use traditional RPG-style upgrade named (+1, +2, +3, etc). The base damage of a +10 weapon is increased by 10 points (equal to Vanilla Legendary). The base Armor Rating of a +10 non-chest piece of armor is increased by 15 points (50% higher than Vanilla Legendary). The base Armor Rating of a chest piece is increased by 30 points (50% higher than Vanilla Legendary).
  
  
You can temper an item to +1 from the beginning of the game. You gain the ability to temper up to one additional tier at 40, 60, 80, and 100 Smithing, for a total of +5. Then, Adamant's five tempering perks each provide one additional tier, allowing you to reach +10. Tempering items also gives significantly more XP. 
  
  
Although it is not possible to advance beyond +10 with Apothecary and Thaumaturgy installed (since they close the crafting loop), Adamant - Plus Ten Smithing does support tiers up to +20 for users who keep the crafting loop in their game. Supporting further tiers requires a simple edit to a .json.
  
  
**Simonrim Attack Speed Fix**
  
  
The Simonrim Attack Speed Fix is an ESL-flagged plugin with a simple and clean attack speed fix implemented through [SPID](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869) and an injected record. This file does not require any individual Simonrim mod, so that it can be used as a "soft requirement" for mods like Thaumaturgy or Apothecary, without forcing users to use Adamant. The mod uses an injected global for patchless compatibility. Feel free use this fix in your own mods (check out the Flourish perk if you need an example of how to use it). 
  
  
It shouldn't have to be said, but please don't install this mod along with other attack speed fixes.
  
  
**Hand to Hand - An Adamant Addon**
  
In Adamant, I have done my best support unarmed combat within the Heavy Armor tree, and to give Lockpicking and Pickpocketing useful perks without adding unrelated mechanics to the tree. However, my preferred solution for unarmed combat is [Hand to Hand - An Adamant Addon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59790). This mod merges Lockpicking and Pickpocket into a single tree, Security, and then adds a standalone Hand to Hand tree. It also makes several changes to Light and Heavy Armor, and comes with several optional addons that make further improvements to those trees. This addon requires **[Address Library for SKSE Plugins](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32444)**and is compatible with pre-AE and post-AE versions of Skyrim. I strongly recommend this mod to everyone who uses Adamant! 
  
  
**General Changes**
  
  
Adamant makes a few changes to general game mechanics in order to support its changes to perks. I have altered several game settings relating to bartering, pickpocket, and magic, including dual casting. In Vanilla, dual casting a spell increases its magnitude or duration by 2.2x, and increases its cost by 2.8x. In Adamant, dual casting a spell increases its magnitude or duration by 2.5x, and increases its cost by 3.0x. 
  
  
In addition, I have removed several Vanilla perks and given them to the player automatically. This means that the player starts with access to a few more mechanics than they would in Vanilla. A comprehensive list of these perks is included below.  
  
  
SpoilerAlteration Dual Casting
  
Conjuration Dual Casting
  
Destruction Dual Casting 
  
Illusion Dual Casting
  
Restoration Dual Casting
  
Arcane Blacksmith

Power Bash 
  
Eagle Eye 
  
Rune Master 
  
Summoner
  
Physician 
  
Intimidation 
  
Bribery
  
Purity
  
  
*If you see any of these perks in your game, you have a conflict in your load order.*
  
**Compatibility**
  
  
Adamant prioritizes compatibility wherever it can. In a few places, however, conflicts are unavoidable. Notably, some combat overhauls might make changes to the same game settings that Adamant does. In addition, crafting and smithing mods almost inevitably must conflict with Adamant, since many of the most popular mods (including WACCF and CCOR) make direct changes to the perk trees. For my part, I have only touched crafting recipes when I felt it was absolutely necessary to create a coherent progression in the perk tree. 
  
  
In addition, Adamant requires Mysticism and thus inherits its compatibility profile. This is largely a non-issue, since magic mods typically require patches for perk mods anyway. I have taken steps to make those compatibility patches as painless as possible: in most cases, they will simply require a keyword to be added to relevant spells.
