[font=Georgia]This is a lightweight AI and aesthetic overhaul aiming to give more life to the Windhelm Bridge.
  
All the bridge guards will no longer do the same patrol back and forth along the bridge, nor will those at the entrance to the city stand still 24 hours a day, instead  they will have specific guard duties among which they will be able to eat, sleep, have a breakfast, wandering here and there and even go to the Candlehearth Hall to have a drink and relax for a few hours.
  
Two named guards have been added to help those patrolling,
  
Bakke is a handyman who takes care of cooking, keeping the deck and living quarters clean, the second NPC is a somewhat anxious guy, especially when he is forced to take a guard duty alone at night! 
  
The guards' quarters are inside the bridge and are equipped with everything that may be useful to the contingent, including beds, cooking station, grindstone etc..
  
Very importantly, this mod is civil war aware.
