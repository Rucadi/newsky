*The essential mod bundle for anyone wanting to roleplay as a reclusive Toxin Doctor, master of the occult knowledge of plagues and poisons, featuring a new themed outfit, weapons, poison magic, a new pet and a large player home.*
  
  
  
  
**Technical info:** This release brings together my Toxin Doctor Laboratory ([LE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/105237)﻿**/**[SE-AE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41752)﻿) and Toxin Doctor Outfit ([LE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/101741)﻿**/**[SE-AE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34408)﻿) mods, in addition to adding two new weapons with themed magical effects and a new frostbite spider pet. In technical terms, this mod works as an update for Toxin Doctor Laboratory, replacing it when installed. It does not replace however the Toxin Doctor Outfit mod, and the mentioned mod can be used together with this mod. However, this new mod adds the armor directly into the player home, dispensing with the use of the specific standalone mod of the outfit.

***Toxin Doctor Outfit-** 
  
  
If you're the kind of alchemist who specializes in venoms and poison-making, you must have this
  
special protective garb to keep yourself safe from being poisoned by your own experiments—or else!
  
And if your clients are just a little bit intimidated by your creepy attire, all the better. 
  
  
As long as you are using this reinforced leather set, you will be completely immune to all forms
  
of poison and to all diseases. In addition, the set offers good protection within the Light Armor
  
category, and can be improved using leather. Naturally being designed as a barrier against infectious
  
agents, it works as a single, complete piece, not divided into parts, or the protection would be broken.
  
Despite this, you can still wear amulets and rings while wearing the outfit. Also, for obvious
  
protection reasons, the tail is protected by the outfit if you are a beast race, and not exposed.
  
  
The set is unisex, and can be used by both genders. Its defense level is much higher than that
  
of leather armor, and slightly higher than that of Thieves Guild leather armor. Of course being
  
a full set, it has the weight of several pieces of armor combined, as well as their defense level.
  
  
A set can be found in the bedroom above the wardrobe in the new house.

Toxin Doctor Weaponry-**
  
  
Two weapons can be found inside the experimentation area. The Vorpal Blade of Pestilence is an ornate iron
  
dagger, with a powerful enchantment that inoculates a strong paralyzing venom into the victim. The Viperhead
  
Cane is an artifact that projects poisonous runes toward opponents, causing explosive toxic damage.

**Toxin Doctor Laboratory-****﻿Located in the catacombs of a small abandoned fort in the mountains of Eastmarch, this laboratory is the ideal player home for toxin doctors, dark alchemists and all kinds of mad scientists, a place where ethics and morals give room for curiosity and experimentation without limits.
  
  
Toxin Doctors are known for their study of the use of toxins, the creation of poisons, the development of cures for diseases, or the use of them in a defensive manner, the application and removal of curses, and everything that creeps through the realms of pestilence. Formerly acclaimed, though seen with fear, in times of great plagues they were often the ones who took the front line healing the sick or at least giving palliative care to the disillusioned, while protecting themselves in their peculiar leather clothes designed to give them protection against all sorts of diseases and poisons. Today, however, in times less afflicted by disease, they are more rare and viewed with suspicion due to their bizarre appearance and their reclusive life inside their laboratories, day and night involved in deep research about the strangest topics possible.**In particular, the owner of this laboratory was very interested in the curse inflicted by Peryite on the group of Bretons who would come to be known as the Afflicted, having housed and studied a couple of them. The house is to the right of the Mzulft dwemer ruin, and this proximity also aroused the doctor's curiosity about the functioning of the dwemer artifacts, which led him to several forays into this ruin, and to collect some of these machinery.
  
  
His studies on both of the aforementioned subjects led him to write journals about them, and later to travel to Bthardamz, on the Reach, probably especially attracted by the combination of Dwemer ruin with a large Afflicted's community living there. By finding and reading the journals inside the lab, you will understand more about the research of the specific owner of the house, and it is worth mentioning that this specific Toxin Doctor who traveled to Bthardamz is the one that appears in my Toxin Doctor Outfit mod. 
  
  
As he always did when he went on long research trips, he left the laboratory in the care of the Afflicted he housed. It is up to you to force your entry, killing, stealing or mentally controlling the guard, to acquire the key, which will allow you to invade and take control of the location. The underground house is spacious, and should be seen as a thematic house, that is, it is not made for all types of character. While it has a vast library, ideal for scholars to store books, a complete alchemy laboratory, with numerous cultivated ingredients, and a section specifically designed for magical arts of enchantment, its area of ​​mannequins or weapon racks is small, as it is not the focus of this type of residence. It is also planned for a couple at most, as the Toxin Doctors, and mad scientists in general, don't exactly have the reputation of family fathers or mothers. In fact, it is believed that they only adopt children if they intend to use them as guinea pigs in some experiment.
  
  
In addition to the large laboratory hall, consisting mainly of two large areas, one for alchemy and the other for magic enchantments, a large library and an autopsy area, the house also has a corridor with an internal garden for cultivating flora and fungi, with running water, located between the mentioned research hall and the living area.
  
  
The connection between the external ruins and the catacombs is made by a spiral staircase that leads to a small warehouse, where it is possible to shelter a pet or a slave, or server. It leads to a large main hall or living room, connected to 4 smaller spaces: a fully functional kitchen, a bathroom, a spacious bedroom and a storage room. The warehouse, as mentioned, not only serves as a possible place for a servant, slave or pet, but also to store various items such as dragon bones or ingots.
  
  
The kitchen, on the other hand, is intended not only for cooking, in its ground fire connected to a chimney, but also has numerous shelves and containers for storing drinks, food and kitchen items. The bathroom is simple, and mostly decorative, while the storage room has at your disposal several chests, barrels, display cases, and other containers, where you can safely store your most precious items. It is worth mentioning, however, that the player home is not a generic house destined for all characters, or particularly interesting to builds such as warriors, as its focus is not on the armor or weapons storage and/or display. 
  
  
The bedroom is spacious, with a double bed, offers machinery to improve armor, tanning rack and two mannequins, in addition to a few more containers, such as wardrobes. Finally, the main hall has several rest areas, in addition to shelves and a large safe box. The ruined building also has a roof, which can be accessed by an internal staircase, which serves as a growing area for some ingredients, and has a cistern that stores rainwater.**A small frostbite spider named Bitsy inhabits the interior of the lab. She is docile and poses no danger.*![](https://i.imgur.com/C4xQPy7.png)﻿
  
The mod is fully compatible with Arthmoor's Keld-Nar mod: both locations are close, but not directly interconnected.
  
So far no incompatibilities have been found between this mod and other mods.
  
(OBS- If by chance when installing several of Mihail's mods at the same time you are asked about files overwriting those of other Mihail mods or other authors mods, don't worry because they are just the same files shared between mods. I recommend that on these occasions always give preference to the files contained in my mods, and among mine always give preference to the mod you are installing last.)

The Unique Player Homes series aims to launch unique themed houses, which distinguish them from generic houses, both vanilla and made by mod, to contribute to the roleplay of specific characters, and provide them with everything they need during their journeys, in addition to contributing greatly to the ambiance of the players' experience.
