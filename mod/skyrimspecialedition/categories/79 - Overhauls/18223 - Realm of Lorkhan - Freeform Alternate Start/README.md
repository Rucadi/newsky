**[font=Georgia]REALM OF LORKHAN[/font]**
  
[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]SpoilerYou are transported to the "Realm of Lorkhan" as soon as you press NEW GAME. Within, you'll purchase your equipment, a standing stone, pray to a god, and finally choose a location to begin the game from.
  
  
[font=Lucida Sans Unicode][size=3]The mod's goal is to enable you full choice over your starting experience.[/font]
  
  
[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]Want to start as a common farmer? An apprentice at the mages' college? Perhaps a common smith? A
  
mercenary? Herbalist? Hunter? Something in between? It's all up to you.[/font]
  
  
You can choose one or more Classes, and take Curses as well. You get one free Class, but for a second or third class you must take on Curses for balance.
  
  
Buy equipment for your adventures from the merchants in Lorkhan, who sell clothing, armors, weapons, spells, potions, scrolls, and other starter goods. You begin with only 500 gold. Maybe you'll squander it, to start out penniless. Or maybe you'll scrounge up as much as you can to start rich. There is a wide selection of starter goods, plus materials available to craft your own starting armor.
  
  
When you are ready to begin the game, touch one of several gems, each taking you to a vastly different area of the game world. You may also return to the Realm of Lorkhan by returning to the gem where you began (although you cannot fast-travel back there).
  
  
**Where should you begin?** The mages' College of Winterhold? A farmer's home? The border to Cyrodiil?
  
The dungeons of Blackreach? The fall forests of Riften? An orc stronghold? A daedric shrine?
  
  
Perhaps you'll go for a survivalist run, starting poorly equipped as a shipwreck survivor off Dawnstar. Or as a brave adventurer, coming upon a dungeon. Even a humble smith playthrough is possible. It's all up to you, and your choices.
  
  
**Play Skyrim exactly how you want, from the very beginning.** Create your own character, with limitless possibilities.[/size][/font]
  
[font=Lucida Sans Unicode][/font]
  
  
[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]**[font=Georgia][size=4]MAIN QUEST / CIVIL WAR**[/font]
  
SpoilerYou'll begin with nothing in your quest log, but can start the main quest by visiting Whiterun and speaking to the Jarl.
  
  
I've edited dialogue to remove references to Helgen on Jarl Balgruuf, Irileth, Ulfric, and General Tullius.
  
  
You'll still be on track to become the Dragonborn**,** whichhappens at the death of Mirmulnir at the Western Watchtower.[font=Lucida Sans Unicode][/font]
  
  
**[font=Georgia]STARTING LOCATIONS[/font]**[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]Spoiler[/font]To exit the Realm of Lorkhan and begin the game proper, you can select from the gems floating around the perimeter of the area.
  
  
You can also use the command 'coc whiterunbanneredmare' or another cell to exit the Realm and spawn anywhere you like!

[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]**[font=Georgia][size=4][b]STANDING STONES**[/font]
  
[/b]All the standing stones can be found within the Realm, same as throughout Skyrim. They will pick up any mods to Standing Stone buffs. They can be found mostly on the ring surrounding the Realm, though some are on the central island. Keep an eye out, and wander around, and you will soon find the one you want most.
  
**[font=Georgia]VAMPIRISM[/font]**Around the side of the main structure, there is a bloody grate which leads to 'Gloomshade', a dark alternate dimension of Lorkhan. Explore within, and you will come upon a vampire from whom you can contract Sanguinaire Vampiris. From there, you may want to sleep or wait a few days to allow it to progress before beginning your game as a vampire!

Spoiler
  
I consider this mod "Mostly Complete" but will be sure to return every once in a while to slightly tweak it.
  
  
I'm also playing around with the idea of a "minimalist" form of Realm of Lorkhan, that is just 1 room and spits you out near to Riverwood. My version of a simple Vanilla+ start.
