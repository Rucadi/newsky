This is an all-in-one package which self configures depending on your preference. Full version will include all items listed above as free to grab items no matter where they are found and the game will notify you when one such item has been picked up. Lore friendly will do the same but removes the non-lore friendly items such as ninja dolls, collector plates, etc. Immersive version will provide the lore friendly items but removes all noticed when they are found and sets all items found inside homes and businesses as owned buy the owning NPC, thus your thief will need to nimble up their fingers.
  
  
**This choice,** ~~pops up at the start of your game and can be re-assigned any time by consoling SETSTAGE aaaSUTItemFinderHandler 10 to bring the menu up again~~. **as of v4.3, is configurable in the MCM menu.**  This merely resets ownership, resets notifications and enables or disables placed items depending on lore choice, but will not hide or add items already found.

A rare and powerful item indeed. Using this item in your inventory will give you a boon for a short time or bestow great riches, knowledge or sustenance upon you every three days when you use it. But beware, the price of power may claim you in the end.

There are 20 unique, weathered metallic chests hidden throughout Skyrim, many of which are buried and awaiting your discovery! Better bring a shovel or a pick. These chests contain a wide assortment of magical leveled gear, great wealth and often unique items!
