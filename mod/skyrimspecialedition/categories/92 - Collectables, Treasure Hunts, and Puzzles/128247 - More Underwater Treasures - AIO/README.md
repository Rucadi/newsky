Adds 56 discoverable underwater treasures all around Skyrim
  
Adds 35 discoverable underwater treasures all around Solstheim
  
  

  
* [i]Cleaned and fixed the single mods released separately and merged together. Maps included*
  
*Removed landscape edits*
  
- *Replaced the  custom Treasures with vanilla TreasDwarvenChestBoss and TreasBanditChestBoss and vanilla leveledlist.*
*I've made a separated file called More Underwater Treasures - AIO - Custom Treasures for those who want to use the custom ones. If you use this you ll have a custom chest with an edited levelled list in order to have more chances to get better loot overall*

[i]if you have installed my previous versions of the mod included the map markers. Remove them and use only this one*
