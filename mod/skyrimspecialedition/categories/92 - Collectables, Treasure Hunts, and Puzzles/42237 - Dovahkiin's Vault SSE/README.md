:: Dovahkiin's Vault ::[/size][/b]
  
  
A storage vault hidden away in The Throat of the World. Only accessible with Clear Skies shout.
  
  
**:: REQUIREMENTS ::**- Skyrim Special Edition up to date
  
  
The vault key can be found on a skeleton near Paarthunaax's perching place (see gallery). 
  
Clicking the key in your inventory will lock the door to the vault. 
  
  
**:: WHAT'S NEW FOR SSE ::**
  
• Added two display cases, one for a bunch of unique daggers and table for some of the skulls in the game
  
• Changed the Thieves Guild display so you have to manyally place all the "Delvin Items"
  
• Changed one of the Elder Scrolls to an Unfurled one for awesomer looks
  
• Improved functionality of some displays (Nightingale weapon display I'm looking at you ಠ\_ಠ )
  
• Fixed the armour gender swapping feature, now some of the armours will display differently based on your character's body type!
  
• Added the survival "Free Shrine Use" so when you use the shrine in Survival Mode, you won't have to pay the gold tribute
  
• Fixed the door locking script (it was missing from the Oldrim version and NO I AM NOT UPDATING THE OLDRIM VERSION DO NOT ASK :D)

It's surrounded by those freezing winds you need Clear Skies for, so not easy to get to! 
  
  
Inside you will find 8 mannequins and 8 basic weapon plaques, 6 weapon racks and 3 shield racks and some cupboards and chests, all these for generic loot.

**:: KNOWN ISSUES ::**
  
*If you have mesh or texture replacers, the displays for weapons and shield may look off.
  
  
Some mods edit the the Mythic Dawn robes and break my displays. If you can't make it accept the robes you have, enable the display via a console command:
  
Check the mod's index and type **prid XX0F40C8** (XX being the mod's load order index) and then type **enable** into the console.
  
  
The activators for the dagger display are WEIRD: Try aiming for them from either side of the display (see gallery) 
  
  
If you use [CL's Weapon Replacers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2916?)﻿, like I do, you may run into Blade of Woe being stuck inside the display case on activate. Use the included patch esp to make the two mods work together.
  
  
[i]Disclaimer: Female mannequins not included. They are from my own modded game.*[/i] 
  
  
I left some empty space and shelves around so you can add your own trophies. I recommend using **[Jaxonz Positioner](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/52583/?)**
  
  
The Thieves Guild display works a bit differently. It's linked to the items in the Cistern, and they will be activated as you progress in the Thieves Guild. The items YOU NEED TO put in yourself are the Nightingale Weapons, armour, the Litany of Larceny items you sell to Delvin (and then steal back :D) and Gallus' Journal. The TG display includes all the small job trophies and the crown of Barenziah which will appear automatically. 
  
  
There are some items in the game that I made display for, but which you cannot actually take with you due to them being quest items you give away: Horn of Jurgen Windcaller, the Golden Claw (if you're not a thief), Potema's Skull, Arvak's Skull and the Dragonstone. I added those into a strongbox inside the vault so you can complete your collection! 
  
  
The last feature of the mod is the shrine to Akatosh. You can pray at it and it plays a prayer idle animation.
  
It's just a basic Akatosh shrine though, part from the added idle feature.

*The background story behind the vault:*
  
SpoilerMade by a request from a donor of mine, with this philosophy:
  
  
*"I have a Dragonborn who has a very particular sense of duty, and not only being in possession of so many dodgy artifacts 
  
(The Elder Scrolls, the various Daedric relics, the Black Books, Auriel's Bow, Staff of Magnus, the Dragon Priest masks, etc...),
  
but also storing them near ordinary people and loved ones goes against their moral code to an incredible degree. 
  
What I've been looking for is a storage vault. Not something sprawling and lavish (and stilted towards the Scrooge McDuck aesthetic, 
  
as many of the existing vault mods are.) I'm looking for something small, protected. A hidden cave or concealed ruin maybe. 
  
No living quarters necessary. Just a place a Dragonborn could lock away all the more compromising pieces of their life away, 
  
to keep them out of the hands of the people they protect on the daily.
  
 
  
Something wholly for an RP aspect, clearly, but it would stop the severe disconnect I experience watching their 
  
spouse sweep the floor in front of the Masque of Clavicus Vile."*
