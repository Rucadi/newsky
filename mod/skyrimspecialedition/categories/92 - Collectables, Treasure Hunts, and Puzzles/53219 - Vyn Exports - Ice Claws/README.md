[font=Lucida Sans Unicode]*Carefully hand placed over 300 Ice Claws all over Skyrim in secret/hidden locations.*
  
  
*Consuming an Ice Claw increases carry capacity by a small amount. There are 4 different versions to choose from: 0.25/0.5/1/2 carry capacity per Ice Claw consumed.
  
  
Over 300 Ice Claws may seem like a lot but they are all across the map and they are placed in well hidden places.
  
Chances are that you find only a fraction of them while playing through the game.
  
  
Includes a small message that shows how many you collected and the maximum and a tutorial message box when you first pick up an Ice Claw.*[/font]

Spoiler with a map of where I roughly placed them in the overworld of Skyrim: (doesn't cover Ice Claws placed in interiors)
  
*The point of the mod is to **make exploration more fun**. This picture is more of a showcase of how they are generally placed.*
