This mod adds Dragonling Eggs, which are not true eggs, but rather a dragon's knowledge magically taking physical form. If left to age long enough, they're said to eventually form Dragonlings, a lesser separate species from dragons. You, however, can use the knowledge yourself.
  
  
**The eggs have about a 50% chance of one dropping on a** **dragon.** If you can't get any to drop, there may be another mod you have that edits their leveled lists and is conflicting. 
  
**There is one egg for each skill and one for health, magicka, and stamina, with 21 total,** all classified as "Potions". **They will level you up to level 100 of that skill;** resetting the skill to Legendary will allow you to level up with the eggs again. The stamina, magic, and health eggs will always increase that value regardless of level.
  
**You can use them, sell them, or collect them!** They roll a bit once you drop them but once you start moving them manually they're very easy to place where you want and stay still. They won't actually form dragonlings ingame, however. Sorry! But if you look at them closely in the right light, you can just make out something condensing and taking form under the shell...
  
  
Cleaned with TES5Edit!
