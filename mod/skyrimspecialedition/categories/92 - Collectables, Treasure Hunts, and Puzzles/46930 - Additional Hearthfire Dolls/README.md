**Note: Not all new Version 3 dolls have passive effects yet.
  
  
General:**
  
  
This mod adds 41 unique new versions of the doll from the Hearthfire DLC. You can find them scattered across the world.
  
  
All of them are worth 150 gold if you want to sell them. Some of them are owned and you need to steal them.
  
  
~~You should be able to gift them to your children. Unfortunately I wasn't able to test that.~~
  
~~Update: Unfortunately you are not able to gift them to your children. Apparently this requires a formlist edit via script and I have no idea how to do that. If anybody knows how to do it feel free to upload a patch or send it to me.~~Update 2: With version 1.1 you can now gift these to your child. Special thanks to [Ic0nic0de](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/45243387) for making the script and cleaning/converting the .esp.
  
  
They use mostly vanilla textures so they will be affected by any texture mods you use.
  
  
Update 3: [sirjesto](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/330797) provided an optional patch with which the dolls have a passive bonus while in the inventory
