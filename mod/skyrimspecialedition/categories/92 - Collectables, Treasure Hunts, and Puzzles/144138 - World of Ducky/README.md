***World of Ducky***
  
  
44 collectible ducks scattered throughout skyrim. each grants +5 health, magicka and stamina and a 10% increase to skill experience upon collecting them all.
  
there is only ONE duck locked behind a quest and its within high hrothgar. 
  
there are 3 additional unused silver, bronze and gold ducks that can be found via additemmenu, simpleadditem, modex, or whatever you use. 
  
  
this mod is uploaded and can work without domain. it is completely standalone and requires no other mods and does not require AE dlc.
  
  
created by treboy the goat before he stepped away from modding. thanks for making domain better than it coulda been. glad to provide minimum assistance lol. due to this, this mod will be essentially delivered as is. any further patches are up to the community. as long as the patch requires this mod, do whatever you want. ports to other languages and platforms are also allowed. 
  
as im only like 20% of this mods creation process, i cannot fix any issues you may have. i've only hotfixed things that were within my capabilities.
