**Requires Skyrim Ver 1.6x due to certain SKSE dependent functions not available on 1.5x**
  
  
New custom display cases you can place anywhere! Simply craft a Placeable Display Pedestal at any forge and place it anywhere you like by dropping one from your inventory. Once dropped it will appear level on the ground in front of you where its placement can then be fine tuned, several custom display case styles enabled on top of it including mannequins, and any item displayed from your inventory which can in turn also be adjusted as needed within the case. All objects are locked down and cannot havoc and the item cannot be removed other than through the pedestal display management menu. Combine multiple pedestals through position adjustment and enable only the central display case in order to create multi-item displays.
  
  
**Craft Placeable Display Pedestals**
  
for the cost of 4 firewood, 2 iron ingots and 2 glass, you can craft the placeable pedestals. Additionally a recipe has been added to smelt quarry stone down into glass to ease the acquisition of materials a bit.
  
  
**Place Pedestals**
  
Drop one or more from your inventory (one at a time). Each one can be adjusted after it is placed on the ground in front of you. Activate each pedestal to control its orientation by rotating, raising and lowering, and nudging the position to where you want it. Group more than one together and place wide or long display cases to simulate a single large case with pedestal sections that control one of several displays in the case above it. You can also adjust the pedestal placement in real time after it is initially dropped into place using the menu and pressing the indicated keys.
  
  
**Display cases**
  
Each pedestal can have various styles of display cases enabled. You can also opt to not enable a display case and merely have a large object on display on the pedestal itself. Leaving cases disabled is helpful when grouping pedestals close together so as to have the central pedestal provide a large display case for the group of displays to be placed within the display case's foot print.
  
  
**Display Item**
  
Each pedestal can display 1 item from your inventory of any kind you wish. Once placed you can use the display management menu to adjust the placement, height, and rotations of the display item. To add a new item, just select the remove option and then place a new item. If pedestals are grouped together under a central display case, you can adjust item placements from each pedestal to fit them within the shared display case. Even stack pedestals to create elevated cases to hold 2 items. Possibilities are extensive.
  
  
**[size=5]Mannequins**
  
Mannequins are placed in much the same way that displays are, but you only have to rotate them. Make sure to rotate and if needed re-center the mannequin BEFORE leaving the area or equipping them. Once they are loaded into the cell again or equipped, the mannequin script will take over and lock their animation making them unable to be rotated. You will have to remove the mannequin and place a new one if you need to adjust it later.
  
  
**Adjusting Placements**
  
After placing pedestals or displays, you can use the pedestal menus to adjust placements. These commands are shown on screen as you make adjustments normally, unless you have another mod that disables tutorial displays like Live Another Life.
  
- Arrows keys to nudge X/Y location
  
- Arrow keys to rotate on X/Y axis (for display items)
  
- Up and Down arrows to raise and lower
  
- L-Shift and R-Shift to rotate
  
**Known issues**
  
-If NPC's bump into displays when you are actively adjusting their placement, you may end up having it knocked out of the display and need to remove and re-place it.
  
  
-Disabling the on screen tutorial feature of the game via the Alternate Start Live Another Life INI will prevent the instructions for repositioning from displaying.
  
  
-Controller mapping is likely not possible given the key selections being used, so using this in conjunction with a keyboard is likely necessary
  
  
-Because of engine limitations, there is sometimes a hiccup with the placeable pedestal item being dropped from a stack of them from your inventory. The game sometimes fails to fire the script and just drops the item and doesn't place it. Just pick it up and try again and it usually works fine every other time. To avoid this problem, try not to carry more than a handful of pedestals at one time (between 5 and 10 max).
